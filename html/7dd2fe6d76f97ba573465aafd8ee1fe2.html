Khader Khalilia: the excitement, the giggles, the kisses, as his young daughters — in their Christmas pajamas — open their gifts. But this year, just the thought of it fills Khalilia with guilt.\n\n“I’m struggling,” said the Palestinian American pastor of Redeemer-St. John’s Lutheran Church in New York. “How can I do it while the Palestinian children are suffering, have no shelter or a place to lay their heads?”\n\nThousands of miles away, near Jesus’ biblical birthplace of Bethlehem, Suzan Sahori has been working with artisans to bring olive wood Christmas ornaments into homes in Australia, Europe and North America. But Sahori is in no mood for festivities: “We’re broken, looking at all these children, all this killing.”\n\nIn a traditional season of merriment, many Palestinian Christians — in Bethlehem and beyond — are gripped with helplessness, pain and worry amid the Israel-Hamas war. Some are mourning, lobbying for the war to end, scrambling to get relatives to safety or seeking comfort in the Christmas message of hope."},{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/h_60/v1696280688/newsgroup-logos/nbcnews/logo/primary-black-424x45.png"},"sameAs":["https://twitter.com/nbcnews","https://pinterest.com/nbcnews","https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://www.instagram.com/nbcnews","https://www.youtube.com/nbcnews","https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Stay_Tuned/7006800740"]},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890#rcrd28551"},"headline":"UNICEF warns of 'very high risk of famine in the Gaza Strip'","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890#rcrd28551","datePublished":"2023-12-23T05:52:18.497Z","dateModified":"2023-12-23T05:52:18.497Z","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Rebecca Cohen","image":null,"jobTitle":null,"description":"Rebecca Cohen is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/author/rebecca-cohen-ncpn1307773","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/beccamcohen"]}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-12/231222-gaza-mb-0951-6e0cbe.jpg","articleBody":"UNICEF estimates at least 1 of 4 houses in Gaza — more than half a million people — \"are facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, the highest level of warning,\" UNICEF said in a statement. \n\nThe statement added that an estimated 1.2 million people are facing \"emergency levels of acute food insecurity,\" noting that \"famine thresholds for acute food insecurity have already been exceeded.\"\n\n\"In short, this means for many families in Gaza, the threat of dying from hunger is already real,\" the statement said. \n\nAdditionally, all children in Gaza under the age of five — totaling 335,000 — are at \"high risk of severe malnutrition and preventable death as the risk of famine conditions continues to increase.\"\n\nAccording to a UNICEF estimate, \"in the coming weeks, at least 10,000 children under five years will suffer the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, known as severe wasting, and will need therapeutic foods.\"\n\nWhile UNICEF said the situation in Gaza is \"unacceptable,\" it acknowledged that it can be reversed and a coming famine can be averted if there is an \"immediate and long-lasting humanitarian ceasefire\" so food and services can be brought into the enclave.

The Hamas militants killed the canine, setting off a firefight with the soldiers. The hostages’ captors died in the gunbattle, but the soldiers moved off, unaware that their compatriots were inside, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nFive days after that missed opportunity, the three hostages were mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers, an incident that has thrown Israel into a new phase of mourning and sparked public outrage.\n\nThe hostages, Alon Shamriz, 26; Yotam Haim, 28; and Samar Talalka, 24, had emerged from a different building bare-chested and holding a makeshift white flag Dec. 15, but they were shot dead by soldiers who thought they were walking into an ambush and hadn’t accounted for the possibility that escaped hostages could be moving around Gaza City, according to a preliminary IDF investigation.\n\nRead the full story here.

It has killed more civilians than the U.S.-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against the Islamic State group.\n\nThe Israeli military has said little about what kinds of bombs and artillery it is using in Gaza. But from blast fragments found on-site and analyses of strike footage, experts are confident that the vast majority of bombs dropped on the besieged enclave are U.S.-made. They say the weapons include 2,000-pound “bunker-busters” that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas.\n\nWith the Palestinian death toll in Gaza surpassing 20,000, the international community is calling for a cease-fire. Israel vows to press ahead, saying it wants to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities following the militant group’s Oct. 7 cross-border rampage that triggered the war, in which it killed 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage.\n\nThe Biden administration has quietly continued to supply arms to Israel.

He was a talented chef, and alongside his wife, Judi, he lived a healthy, active lifestyle. We mourn the loss of our father and grandfather, and we continue to hope and pray that his body will be returned to us and that Judi is still alive and we will be reunited soon.\n\n “We continue to urge our leaders to do everything they can to bring our parents home to us.

Pape said this amounted to 10% of buildings across Germany, compared to more than 33% across Gaza, a densely populated territory of just 140 square miles.\n\n“Gaza is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history,” he said. “It now sits comfortably in the top quartile of the most devastating bombing campaigns ever.”\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition’s 2017 assault to expel the Islamic State terrorist group from the Iraqi city of Mosul was considered one of the most intense attacks on a city in generations. That nine-month battle killed around 10,000 civilians, a third of them from coalition bombardment, according to an Associated Press investigation at the time.\n\nDuring the 2014-17 campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq, the coalition carried out almost 15,000 strikes across the country, according to Airwars, a London-based independent group that tracks recent conflicts. By comparison, the Israeli military said last week it has conducted 22,000 strikes in Gaza."},{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/h_60/v1696280688/newsgroup-logos/nbcnews/logo/primary-black-424x45.png"},"sameAs":["https://twitter.com/nbcnews","https://pinterest.com/nbcnews","https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://www.instagram.com/nbcnews","https://www.youtube.com/nbcnews","https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Stay_Tuned/7006800740"]},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890#rcrd28520"},"headline":"Catch up with NBC News’ latest coverage of the war ","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890#rcrd28520","datePublished":"2023-12-22T09:59:02.444Z","dateModified":"2023-12-22T12:44:40.684Z","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"NBC News","image":null,"jobTitle":null,"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://instagram.com/nbcnews","https://twitter.com/nbcnews"]}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-12/231222-gaza-mb-0951-6e0cbe.jpg","articleBody":"Palestinian support for ‘armed struggle’ is rising as Gaza death estimate tops 20,000Is Israel’s offensive succeeding or failing?13-year-old Palestinian American was shot by Israeli soldiers and detained, his family saysThis woman became the face of Israel’s music festival hostages.

For the most recent updates, click here. What to know A long-delayed resolution for desperately needed aid to Gaza was approved by the U.N. Security Council today. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the world body, said negotiators had finally agreed on wording America could support. It comes after high-level diplomacy aimed at avoiding another U.S. veto. The U.S. abstained from the final vote. Hamas reportedly rejected a proposed Israeli truce  deal that would have secured the release of 40 hostages in exchange for a one-week pause in fighting. The group has also indicated that there would be no more negotiations over prisoner exchanges unless Israel halted the fighting.  An estimated 20,000 people — almost 1% of the territory&#x27;s prewar population — have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The vast majority of the enclave&#x27;s 2.2 million people are displaced, and the U.N. said yesterday that more than half a million face starvation.  Israeli military officials say 137 soldiers have been killed during the country&#x27;s ground invasion in Gaza, which came after Hamas killed 1,200 people and seized about 240 hostages Oct. 7.  NBC News’ Jay Gray and Josh Lederman are reporting from the region.

The reported Palestinian death toll now stands at more than 20,000. </p><div class="hidden-show-more-content"></div><div class="share-list__wrapper mt6"><div class="df justify-start lh-none share-list dn-print" data-testid="social-share-list"><input type="checkbox" class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--9121" tabindex="-1" checked=""><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon share-list__social-list-icon--first"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28544%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hamas%20calls%20U.N.%20resolution%20on%20Gaza%20aid%20'insufficient'&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28544%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28544%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=Hamas calls U.N. resolution on Gaza aid 'insufficient'&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28544%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div><a href="sms:?&amp;body=Hamas calls U.N. resolution on Gaza aid 'insufficient' via  -

members and friends have been killed in the strip this week alone, after his hometown of Sabra was bombed by Israeli forces Monday. </p><p class="">“They hit the neighbor's house, next to my father’s house. The walls jumped, and Asma collapsed,” he said, describing the death of a female family member, who was the mother of two. Sabra, on the western outskirts of Gaza City, was an area his family believed would be safe, having been largely unaffected by previous wars with Israel. Now, Shehaiber believes, many family members remain buried under the rubble, with no diesel or supplies to assistin the efforts to recover them. </p><p class="">“The house that got destroyed, I grew up in it. All my childhood, gone. I have no childhood left,” he said. He added that in Gaza, Israeli bombing campaigns would only increase support for Hamas, instead of eradicating the group as Israel and the U.S. hope.</p><p class="">“Please stop it, Mr. Biden. You can do it,” he said. Referring to Israel’s campaign on the strip, he said, “It will only cause more problems, more hatred.” </p><div class="hidden-show-more-content"></div><div class="share-list__wrapper mt6"><div class="df justify-start lh-none share-list dn-print" data-testid="social-share-list"><input type="checkbox" class="dn" id="social-menu-toggle--9141" tabindex="-1" checked=""><ul class="share-list__social-list js-social-share"><li class="share-list__social-list-text founders-mono">Share this -</li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon share-list__social-list-icon--first"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28519%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-facebook share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon social-share-list__icon--twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Palestinian%20American%20mourns%20death%20of%20100%20family%20members%20and%20friends%20&amp;via=NBCNews&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28519%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28519%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="icon icon-twitter share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li><li class="share-list__social-list-icon"><a href="mailto:?subject=Palestinian American mourns death of 100 family members and friends &amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flive-blog%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890%2Frcrd28519%3FcanonicalCard%3Dtrue"><span class="icon icon-email share-list__social-icon"></span></a></li></ul></div><a href="sms:?&amp;body=Palestinian American mourns death of 100 family members and friends  via  - https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-hamas-rejects-israeli-cease-fire-offer-rcna130890/rcrd28519?canonicalCard=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="share__sms styles_share__sms__DGxUZ" data-icid="ed_npd_nn_nn_np_liveblog" data-testid="sms-link"><svg width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sms"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" fill="#2A2A2A" d="M14 11.25H3.333L0 14.583V1a1 1 0 011-1h13a1 1 0 011 1v9.25a1 1 0 01-1 1zm-9.875-4.5a1.125 1.125 0 100-2.25 1.125 1.125 0 000 2.25zM9 5.625a1.125 1.125 0 11-2.25 0 1.125 1.125 0 012.25 0zm2.625 1.125a1.125 1.125 0 100-2.25 1.125 1.125 0 000 2.25z"></path></svg></a><button class="share__link-copy styles_share__link-copy__hjJp_" type="button" data-testid="share__link-copy"><span class="icon icon-link" data-testid="icon-link"></span><div data-testid="share__link-copytext" class="styles_share__copied-message__W1I6R"><span class="icon icon-alt-check styles_icon-alt-check__zl49O"></span>Copied</div><textarea class="styles_share__copy-area__gm9tU" tabindex="-1" readonly=""></textarea></button></div></div><div class="live-blog-card article-body__content w-100 mh0 mb8 fn" id="rcrd28524" data-testid="card-container"><div class="styles_cardTimestamp__zTumd styles_eventEnded__KgMbW"><div class="styles_timestamp__dS4G7" data-testid="timestamp">2d ago / 10:40 AM UTC</div></div><h2 class="styles_cardHeadline__pyPuZ" data-testid="headline">Hezbollah and Israel trade fire over Lebanese border</h2><div class="styles_cardByline__iFouW"><span class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--no-image" data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><div class="styles_inner__Bqhn1"><p class="styles_authors__pctbg" data-testid="byline"><span class="byline-name" data-testid="byline-name">Leila Sackur</span></p></div></div><p class="">The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah targeted “gatherings of enemy soldiers” at a barracks in northern Israel this morning, it said in a statement today. </p><p class="">The Iran-backed militia said it achieved "direct hits" with rockets and artillery after it targeted the Shomera barracks near Israel's northern border. </p><p class="">In a statement on Telegram, the IDF said it had identified a number of launches from Lebanon and it had "struck the sources of the fire with artillery."
