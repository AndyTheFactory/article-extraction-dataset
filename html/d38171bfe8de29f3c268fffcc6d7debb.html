He also reiterated that WR Tyreek Hill (ankle) had no setbacks and he feels good about Hill playing.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1738247687416295919"></a></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Hill, 29, has largely stayed healthy for the Dolphins in his two seasons in Miami, playing all 17 games in 2022 and only missing the Week 15 win over the Jets this season.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">When he's been on the field he's been essentially unstoppable, with head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa helping him to unlock a new level. In his first season with the team he posted 119 catches for 1,710 yards and seven touchdowns.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-1102759" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="0" data-country="RO" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[970,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[728,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[728,90],[300,250],[2,2]]],[[0,0],[&quot;fluid&quot;,[300,250],[320,50],[2,2]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">He's on pace to smash those marks, registering 97 catches for 1,542 yards and 12 touchdowns in just 13 appearances this season. That has many people hyping him as a potential MVP candidate, something a wide receiver has never achieved, though the expectation is that a quarterback—potentially Tagovailoa—will claim the award.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Nonetheless, Hill has been an absolute menace and should be in the running for the Offensive Player of the Year award, which likely will come down to either him or San Francisco 49ers' running back Christian McCaffrey.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><p class="">Hill's ability to stretch defenses with his otherworldly speed and turn short catches into long touchdowns makes him a uniquely gifted playmaker, and one who is essentially impossible to replace. In his absence in Week 15, however, Jaylen Waddle (eight catches for 142 yards and a score) stepped up in a big way.</p></div><div class="intersectionObserverRefElement"><div class="organism
