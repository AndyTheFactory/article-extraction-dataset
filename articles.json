        "articleBody": "ATLANTA -- Federal drug officials are warning Georgia to shelve its plans to be the first state to allow pharmacies to dispense medical marijuana products.\n\nNews outlets report that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on Nov. 27 warned pharmacies that dispensing medical marijuana violates federal law.\n\nThe Georgia Board of Pharmacy began accepting applications to dispense the products in October. Licenses have already been issued to 23 Georgia independent pharmacies, the board said.\n\nThe Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission, which oversees Georgia's fledgling medical marijuana industry, said it can't override the federal directive, even though pharmacies are allowed to dispense the products under state law.\n\nAndrew Turnage, the commission's executive director, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the state would love to see pharmacists be allowed to continue providing consultations for medical cannabis products as they do with other medication.\n\nIn a memo to pharmacies, the DEA said none of them can lawfully possess, handle or dispense marijuana or related products containing more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol — the psychoactive chemical known as THC that gives users a high.\n\nGeorgia lets patients with medical needs buy medical marijuana products with up to 5% THC. Marijuana sold for recreational use typically has a higher level.\n\nThe DEA said it considers products derived from the cannabis plant with a THC content above 0.3% to be marijuana, making it illegal under federal drug law.\n\nGeorgia has allowed patients with certain illnesses and physician approval to possess and consume low-THC medical cannabis products since 2015. But until April, there was no legal way for them to buy the product in Georgia.\n\nNationwide, 24 states have legalized marijuana for recreational use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Another 23 allow some form of medical cannabis.\n\nThe recent DEA notice was published online by the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which generally opposes marijuana legalization.\n\nIra Katz of Little Five Points Pharmacy in Atlanta told WXIA-TV that he thought pharmacies like his should able to dispense the products in the same way marijuana dispensaries do.\n\n“It just doesn’t make any sense to me that people can go to a dispensary and not to a pharmacy,” he said. “We would be buying it from the same growers.”\n\nMahlon Davidson, interim CEO of the Georgia Pharmacy Association, said he doubted independent pharmacists would risk imperiling their businesses by flouting the DEA.\n\n“The current conflict between state and federal law puts Georgia’s pharmacies in a difficult position,” the Georgia Pharmacy Association wrote in a letter to pharmacists, adding that the association is “putting forth the maximum effort to help provide timely information and assist in navigating this issue.”\n\nThose who oppose rapid legalization of marijuana said the DEA's stance will protect consumers and allow time for more research.\n\nMichael Mumper, the executive director of the nonprofit Georgians for Responsible Marijuana Policy, said consumers trust that drugs dispensed from pharmacies are fully tested, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and federally legal. Mumper said that’s not the case with medical marijuana.\n\nBut the federal stance could change if a recent proposal to loosen restrictions on marijuana goes through. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in August proposed taking marijuana off the banned list of Schedule I substances and reclassifying it as a lower-risk Schedule III drug.",

Those areas will see an increase of more than nine percent, prompting lawmakers like Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan to speak out.\n\n\"No state, including Alaska, should be punished by our own federal government because of geography,\" Sullivan said in part in a statement in December. \"These hikes have the potential to severely negatively impact Alaskans – already reeling from inflation – who are more reliant on the USPS for basic goods and services than other Americans.\"",

        "authors": "Pamela Falk",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "United Nations – The U.N. Security Council voted Friday to speed up the process of delivering aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and demand that all the hostages held by Hamas be released immediately and without conditions. The U.S. abstained on the measure, allowing the resolution to pass, after days of negotiations on the terms.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by a vote of 13-0 with 2 abstensions, by the U.S. and Russia. Before the vote, Russia proposed an amendment that was vetoed by the U.S.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council resolution was changed on the morning of the vote to call for \"urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\"\n\nAlthough the final text does not make a renewed call for a pause in the fighting or demand a cease-fire — as the Arab group of nations at the U.N. wanted — it was a diplomatic breakthrough for the U.S. and United Arab Emirates negotiators that avoids a feared veto by Washington and creates a pathway to expedite food, water and fuel to Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe United States worked at the U.N., in Washington and around the world to negotiate compromises in the resolution drafted by the United Arab Emirates. In its final form, the resolution does not constrain Israel's ability to degrade the militant group Hamas' military arsenal, nor does it impede Israel's ability to search for Israeli, American and other nations' hostages who are still in captivity in Gaza.\n\nThe draft resolution also contains a commitment of world powers to a two-state solution with Israel and the Palestinians living \"side-by-side\" — with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank unified under the Palestinian Authority — a governance role for the Palestinian Authority that Israel recently said it opposes, but which is an acknowledgement by the Arab Group of nations at the U.N. that Hamas will no longer have a de-facto governing role in a post-conflict Gaza.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after a Thursday evening meeting that the U.S. supported the resolution's passage because it will bring humanitarian aid \"to those in need.\"\n\nThe 11th-hour breakthrough compromise calls for \"urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities\" in Israel's ongoing war with the Hamas militant group. The U.S. had  vetoed two previous attempts at a Security Council resolution on Gaza since the beginning of the war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel.\n\nThe resolution demands a substantial increase in aid for Gaza with an opening of more land, sea and air routes into the Palestinian territory, and, in language changed on the morning of the vote, \"calls for urgent steps to immediately allow safe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access and to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\"\n\nSeveral top U.S. officials were involved in the intense negotiations over the draft this week, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield, CIA Director Bill Burns, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\n\nU.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron met with French and Italian leaders to push for a \"sustainable cease-fire\" in the conflict, as Hamas' most senior leader, Ismail Haniyeh, traveled to Egypt this week to discuss proposals for a possible new pause in the fighting that would allow for aid deliveries and the return of more hostages along with the release of more Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails — a proposal that Hamas has so far rejected.\n\nThe draft resolution adopted Friday demands that all of the remaining hostages believed to be held in Gaza, about 130 people, including Americans, be released immediately. It also calls for more border points to be opened into the territory for the delivery of aid, and it endorses the long-sought \"two-state solution\" for the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.\n\nU.S. administrations have advocated for such a solution for decades, although the prospects for achieving it currently appear remote. The draft resolution proposed a plan for a two-state solution \"where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine\" would live \"side by side\" — a plan that would unify the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under Palestinian Authority leadership, without Hamas' control in Gaza.\n\n\"It took many days, and many, many long nights of negotiating to get this right, but today, this Council provided a glimmer of hope amongst a sea of unimaginable suffering,\" Thomas-Greenfield said after the vote.\n\nThe main sticking point, among several issues of contention during the negotiations, was the draft resolution's proposal to set up a U.N. monitoring system for aid flowing into Gaza. An earlier draft proposed that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres create a system for the U.N. \"to exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes of those states that are not parties to the conflict.\"\n\nThat was changed to a request that Guterres appoint \"a Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator with responsibility for facilitating, coordinating, monitoring and verifying\" whether relief deliveries to Gaza are humanitarian goods and to \"establish a UN mechanism for accelerating the provision of humanitarian relief\"  — enabling Israel to continue to have a role in the security process.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters about the difficulties of getting the needed humanitarian aid into Gaza: \"We have to deal with different parties. We're trying to bring humanitarian aid into a live conflict zone. It is complex. And you know, ideally, if there were less burdens and there was no fighting more aid could go in.\"\n\nSince the Oct, 7 attack by Hamas militants on Israel, the Security Council approved a November resolution calling for \"urgent and extended humanitarian pauses,\" but a December resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire was vetoed by the United States, which also voted against a General Assembly resolution calling for a cease-fire.\n\n\"All sides have been more flexible in negotiations this time around.  I think that the U.S. wants to show it cares about the suffering in Gaza, and the Emiratis and Arab group have wanted to show they are not just trying to shame Washington,\" Richard Gowan, U.N. Director for the International Crisis Group, told CBS News.\n\nGowan added, \"I don't think this process and resolution will entirely erase bad feelings over the U.S. rejection of the cease-fire text. U.N. members will want to see Biden taking more steps to halt the war.\"",

        "title": "How to Create A Vision Board With Your Kids",
        "authors": "Zayda Rivera",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A vision board can be a great tool to help children plan—and manifest—their dreams and goals. Here's how to help your kids create one for the new year.\n\nFact checked by Sarah Scott\n\nVision boards are a great way to bring your dreams to life in bright, bold colors. This creative activity is a wonderful way to teach children the link between our thoughts and our reality—and to help them create a growth mindset and positive outlook. A vision board also gives the tiniest members of the family a way to honor their unique ideas and aspirations about life, and gives them a voice through photos and other visual cues.\nWhat Is a Vision Board?\n\nAt its most basic, a vision board is a collage of images that help us focus on goals, dreams, and ambitions. But the magic of creating one—and keeping it front and center—can help us manifest our greatest ambitions. Teaching kids to visualize their hopes at a young age can set them up for success for the future.\n\nAs we head into the holiday season and the end of yet another new year, it is important for us to show gratitude for the things we currently have in our lives alongside manifesting our future goals and resolutions. To spark the inspiration of inviting our dreams into our reality, consider vision boards as a fun family activity to spark the magic of manifestation within your children.\nWhy Are Vision Boards Beneficial for Kids?\n\n“Vision boards are a powerful way to get clear about what we want, to build our confidence in seeking it out, and to identify concrete and tangible symbols of our desires that we can use to mark success when we attain it,” says Dr. Dinorah Nieves, a behavioral scientist, counselor, and coach.\n\nThis visual representation of our desires and aspirations has been used by world-renowned celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, who created a vision board with a photo of Barack Obama and the dress she would wear to his inauguration before he was elected to his first term in office. Her good friend, and then soon-to-be First Lady, Michelle Obama was the one who inspired her to do it.\n\n“I created a vision board,” she told Power 105.1’s Ed Lover Morning Show on November 4, 2008, the day of the presidential election. “I got me a board and put Barack Obama’s picture on it and I put a picture of my dress I want to wear to the inauguration.”\n\nSharing stories like these with your children can excite them to put their own vision into action with boards that represent their desires and goals. Vision boards can help them feel more confident in expressing their own ideas about life and where they see themselves going in the future. Vision boards can be created digitally, but there is something powerful about creating one with your hands and a variety of materials that feel aligned with individual objectives.\nA Step-By-Step Guide to Creating A Vision Board\n\nHere’s a step-by-step approach to creating vision boards with your children in a fun-creative way:\nIntention Setting\n\nTo get started, make each step in the process an opportunity to set an intention. After explaining what a vision board is to your children, ask them what they would like to create and why. What is a dream they would like to see come true in the next year or so?\nVisual Meditation\n\nBefore setting out to get supplies for the vision board, engage your children in a short, 1- to 3-minute visualization meditation.\n\nSit together in a circle on the living room floor, outside, or wherever you feel most comfortable. Then ask your kids to close their eyes and dream big about something they want to call into their lives within the next year.\n\nAfter a minute or so, ask them to gently open their eyes and keep whatever came to mind safe in their heart as you begin gathering the materials they need to bring that vision to life. You can even go around the circle and share what each of you saw.\nStrengthening Your Intuition\n\nAs your children choose the materials they’d like to use, tell them to tap into their intuition—that little voice inside that helps to guide them. They can do this by looking at the supplies and gravitating toward the ones that feel right.\n\nWhether it’s colorful paper, string, glitter, or stickers, give them the space to connect their feelings and emotions to the materials of their choice. Ask them, “Which materials are speaking to you? Which ones are saying, ‘Choose me!’”\n\nThese could be materials bought in a store or even things found in nature like flowers, leaves, and twigs.\nUse Old Magazines and Newspaper to Spark New Ideas\n\nGrab that stack of old magazines and newspapers, if you have any, and make it fun for the children to flip through the pages and cut out anything that gravitates to them. This could be words, photos, a splash of color on the page, or anything that coincides with the intentions they set. They can begin by simply ripping out the pages and then take time in cutting out the sections that will be added to their board.\nCreate Your Vision Board\n\nWith intentions set, materials intuitively selected, and the visual prompts needed to bring it altogether, the children can begin creating their vision board, using their imagination and intuition to collage the pieces together.\n\nUse glue sticks to strategically place the materials on the board. Instruct them to have fun with it and fill the board as much as possible with everything they envision for their future over the next 12 months and beyond.\nDisplay Your Vision Board—And Let the Magic Do Its Work!\n\nIt’s a good idea to have your vision board somewhere easily visible. While you don’t want to think about what goals you set all day, every day, it’s a nice reminder when you see your vision board consistently. Maybe your child would like to hang their vision board in their room. Or create a family vision board wall or gallery where all of your dreams and goals can be displayed all together.\n\nIdeally, you want to keep the vision boards up for the entire year. Then have your children take a look at what they created and see how many of their dreams came to fruition. This will spark an inspiration in them to continue dreaming big and being confident that the dreams that align with them will become reality.",

        "title": "Florida State has sued the ACC, setting the stage for a fight to leave over revenue concerns",
        "authors": "RALPH D. RUSSO, BOB FERRANTE",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida State sued the Atlantic Coast Conference on Friday, challenging an agreement that binds the school to the league for the next 12 years with more than half a billion dollars in fees for leaving and taking the first step in a lengthy and uncertain process toward a potential exit.\n\n“Today we’ve reached a crossroad in our relationship with the ACC,” Florida State Board of Trustees chairman Peter Collins said during a trustees meeting to approve the legal action.\n\nAfter months of threats and warnings from Florida State, the lawsuit was filed in Leon County Circuit Court. The suit claims the ACC has mismanaged its members’ media rights and is imposing “draconian” exit fees. Breaking the grant-of-rights agreement and leaving the ACC right now would cost Florida State $572 million, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn a preemptive counter attack, the ACC filed a lawsuit in North Carolina against the Florida State Board of Trustees, claiming the school could not challenge the grant of rights that it had signed and that these issues should be decided in the state where the conference is located.\n\nACC Commissioner Jim Phillips and Virginia President Jim Ryan, chairman of the conference’s board of directors, said Florida State’s actions are “in direct conflict with their longstanding obligations and is a clear violation of their legal commitments to the other members of the conference.”\n\n“All ACC members, including Florida State, willingly and knowingly re-signed the current Grant of Rights in 2016, which is wholly enforceable and binding through 2036,” their statement said. “Each university has benefited from this agreement, receiving millions of dollars in revenue and neither Florida State nor any other institution, has ever challenged its legitimacy.”\n\nDavid Ashburn, an attorney representing Florida State, said during the board meeting the ACC’s grant of rights violates antitrust law, has unenforceable withdrawal penalties and is not even a valid contract. The lawsuit also accuses the ACC of breach of contract by not upholding conference bylaws and violation of public policy.\n\n“It’s hard to handicap where those claims will go,” said Mit Winter, a Kansas City, Missouri-based sports attorney. “And I think Florida State knows that as well. I think they threw in anything they could potentially think of as a colorable argument to get them out of the grant-of-rights agreement.”\n\nFlorida State is looking for a way out of a conference it has been a member of since 1992. During its time in the ACC, Florida State has won three football national championships, the most recent in 2013, and made the first College Football Playoff in 2014.\n\nThe Seminoles were left out of this year’s playoff, despite an unbeaten record. Florida State President Richard McCullough said the playoff snub did not prompt the lawsuit.\n\n“This is not a reaction, but something we’ve done a lot of due diligence on,” he said.\n\nThe first sentence of Florida State’s claim is: “The stunning exclusion of the ACC’s undefeated football champion from the 2023-2024 College Football Playoff in deference to two one-loss teams from two competing Power Four conferences crystalized the years of failures by the ACC to fulfill its most fundamental commitments to FLORIDA STATE and its members.”\n\nOnly the Southeastern Conference has placed more teams in the playoff than the ACC. Clemson won two CFP titles for the ACC.\n\nFlorida State leaders believe the ACC locked its members into an undervalued and unusually lengthy contract with ESPN that leaves the Seminoles’ athletic programs at a massive disadvantage against schools in the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference, which have TV deals that pay more over a shorter period of time.\n\n“We are faced with the fact that the ACC is locked into a deteriorating media rights contract at revenues far below other conferences,” Collins said. “It’s one thing to fundraise and make up $7 million. It’s another entirely to annually make up over $30 million to $40 million.”\n\nFlorida State was one of 15 ACC members to sign the grant of rights, which hands a school’s media rights over to the conference. They are commonly used by college sports conferences to provide stability and certainty to media partners.\n\nNo school has ever challenged a grant of rights to exit a conference. In the recent wave of conference realignment, moves were made to line up with the expiration of the grant of rights in the Pac-12 and Big 12.\n\nThe Big 12 negotiated at settlement with the Oklahoma and Texas that allowed the schools to leave one year early for $50 million each.\n\n“I guess the one factor here that might not be present in some of the other situations, I think the ACC is really worried if we let Florida State leave there’s going to be like a domino effect and the ACC might not exist anymore,” Winter said.\n\nFlorida State leaders also say the ACC refuses to change its revenue distribution model to match FSU’s value.\n\n“It is a simple math problem,” Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said.\n\nFlorida State is not the only ACC school to push for more revenue. Clemson, North Carolina and others have also made the case, but Alford and the Seminoles have been the most vocal.\n\nThe ACC has agreed to create a bonus system that would direct more revenue to schools that have postseason success in football and basketball. To add to that pot, the ACC is expanding to include Stanford, California and SMU next year. Those schools have agreed to decreased revenue distribution upon entry for several years. The extra money ESPN is obligated to pay for new members will go to the bonus pool.\n\nFlorida State was one of three ACC members, including Clemson and North Carolina, to oppose the expansion, which the lawsuit claims could hurt the long-term value of the ACC’s media rights and did nothing to address the Seminoles’ frustrations.\n\n“It’s time for us to try to do something about it,” McCullough said.",

        "authors": "Heather Hollingsworth",
        "date": "2023-01-02",
        "articleBody": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A romance that united sports and music fans, a celestial wonder that drew millions of eyes skyward and a spiritual homecoming for some Native American tribes were just some of the moments that inspired us and brought joy in 2023.\n\nIn a year that saw multiple wars, deadly mass shootings, earthquakes, wildfires, sexual harassment stories and other tragedies, these events were among those that broke through the tumult of 2023 and made people feel hopeful.\n\nAs Taylor Swift would say, “Hold on to the memories.” Here are a few of them:\n___\nA FRIENDSHIP BRACELET WITH A PHONE NUMBER\n\nThat’s how Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce planned to woo superstar Taylor Swift when he went to her Eras Tour concert stop in the Missouri capital. It didn’t work — at first.\n\nBut the romantic gesture, and public admission of defeat on his “New Heights” podcast, caught the Grammy Award-winner’s attention. After the power pair took their relationship public — she went to a Chiefs game and sat in a box with Kelce’s mom, to the delight of fans — they began taking the world by storm.\n\nSportscasters calculated Swift’s effect on Kelce’s game stats and TV viewership, national magazines offered up comprehensive dating timelines, and Swift fans scoured Kelce’s old social media posts to make sure he was fit for their queen.\n\nOn tour in Buenos Aires, the then-33-year-old singer changed a lyric from “Karma is the guy on the screen” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs.” And fans went crazy when she jumped into Kelce’s arms for an iconic post-concert kiss.\n\n“I think we’re all excited about it. Until they start making good romcoms again, this is what we have,” said Michal Owens, a 37-year-old longtime fan from the Indianapolis suburb of Zionsville.\n\nWhile pint-sized pairs of trick-or-treaters donned glitzy dresses and Chiefs jerseys this Halloween, Owens transformed her outdoor display into a tribute. The mother of three dressed one 12-foot-tall (3.66-meters-tall) skeleton in a Chiefs jersey, another in a sparkly dress and then stacked three smaller skeletons atop one another to create what she called a “tower of Swifties.”\n\n“We’ve got so many things in the world to be sad about,” she said. “Why not find something to root for and give us some joy?”\n____\nAN AWE-INSPIRING ECLIPSE\n\nFrom Oregon’s coast to the beaches of Corpus Christi, Texas, millions of people in October donned special glasses and gazed upward to take in the dazzling “ ring of fire” eclipse of the sun.\n\n“It’s kind of spiritual, but in a way that is almost tangible,” University of Texas at San Antonio astrophysics professor Angela Speck said as she recalled the type of eclipse that ancient Mayan astronomers called a “broken sun.”\n\nCrowds in the path of the eclipse erupted in cheers when the moon blocked out all but a brilliant circle of the sun’s outer edge. Participants at an international balloon fiesta in Albuquerque, New Mexico, whooped from the launch pad. Broadcasters for NASA said they felt a chill as the moon cast a shadow over the earth — and one broadcaster was so overcome with emotion that she began crying.\n\nThe phenomenon was a prelude to the total solar eclipse that will sweep across Mexico, the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada, in April 2024. But the next “ring of fire” eclipse won’t be visible in the U.S. until 2039 and then only in parts of Alaska.\n___\nIN DEATH, A SELFLESS ACT\n\nSurprise letters are showing up in mailboxes, informing recipients that their medical debt is wiped away.\n\nThey have Casey McIntyre to thank. The 38-year-old New York City book publisher nearly died of cancer in May. But in what her husband, Andrew Rose Gregory, called a “bonus summer,” the young mother made plans to help people after she was gone. Her goal: To erase medical debt.\n\nIn a message posted after her death in November, she asked for donations, writing, “I loved each and every one of you with my whole heart and I promise you, I knew how deeply I was loved.”\n\nBy December, the campaign had raised more than $1 million, enough to erase around $100 million in debt. That’s because the nonprofit RIP Medical Debt says every dollar donated buys about $100 in debt.\n\n“Her positive spirit is just resonating with a lot of people,” said Allison Sesso, the nonprofit’s president and CEO.\n\nThe effort was inspired by the people McIntyre met during treatment. They weren’t just worried about their health but how to pay for their care. She had good insurance — and “couldn’t even fathom having to deal with that on top of the cancer,” Sesso said.\n\nThe fundraiser, which quickly shattered its initial goal of $20,000, gave her family a sliver of “something positive” to focus on amid their grief. It was particularly hard for the family because when McIntyre died, her daughter was just a toddler, not yet 2.\n\n“This sounds crazy but she didn’t seem angry at all,” said Sesso. “She was like, ‘This happened. I’ve accepted that this has happened, and I’m going to do this positive thing.’”\n____\nA SPIRITUAL HOMECOMING\n\nWhen the Grand Canyon became a national park over a century ago, many Native Americans who called it home were displaced.\n\nIn 2023, meaningful steps were taken to address the federal government’s actions. In May, a ceremony marked the renaming of a popular campground in the inner canyon from Indian Garden to Havasupai Gardens, or “Ha’a Gyoh,” in the Havasupai language.\n\nIt marked a pivotal moment in the tribe’s relationship with the U.S. government nearly a century after the last tribal member was forcibly removed from the park. The Havasupai Tribe was landless for a time until the federal government set aside a plot in the depths of the Grand Canyon for members.\n\nThen in August, President Joe Biden signed a national monument designation — over the opposition of Republican lawmakers and the uranium mining industry — to help preserve about 1,562 square miles (4,046 square kilometers) to the north and south of Grand Canyon National Park.\n\nIt was another big step for the Havasupai, and for the 10 other tribes that consider the Grand Canyon their ancestral homeland.\n\nThe new national monument is called Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni. “Baaj Nwaavjo” meaning “where tribes roam,” for the Havasupai people, while “I’tah Kukveni” translates to “our footprints,” for the Hopi Tribe.\n\nThe move restricts new mining claims and brings tribal voices to the table to manage the environment, said Jack Pongyesva, of the Grand Canyon Trust, an advocacy group that represents tribal and environmental issues in the region.\n\nHe said it also could open the door for more cultural tourism, where visitors could learn not just about the landscape but about the tribes — from the tribes themselves.\n\nPongyesva, a member of the Hopi Tribe, said the dedication is “The beginning of hopefully this healing and looking back and seeing what was wrong and moving forward together.”\n___\nA RESILIENT RETURN\n\nFirs are mainstays of Christmas tree lots. But on the Isle Royale National Park near Michigan’s border with Canada, balsam firs were being devoured.\n\nGray wolves on the remote island cluster in Lake Superior were already dying out from inbreeding, causing the moose population to become a “runaway freight train” and strip the trees during long, snowbound winters, said Michigan Tech biologist Rolf Peterson.\n\nAn ambitious plan was hatched to airlift wolves from the mainland to the park — and it’s starting to make a big difference. A report this year shows the resurging wolf population is thriving and the moose total is shrinking, giving the trees a chance to recover.\n\nThere were critics of the plan, but Peterson said there weren’t other viable options. Because of climate change, particularly global warming, there are fewer ice bridges, reducing wolves’ ability to trek from the mainland and diversify the gene pool.\n\n“That was a huge undertaking,” Peterson said, and it turned out “spectacularly well.”\n____\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that firs are the primary food source of moose, not wolves.",

We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.\n\nGood morning. It's December 21, and today's image showcases our very own Milky Way Galaxy above the Pyrenees mountain range, which separates Spain from the rest of Europe.\n\nIt was sent in by a reader who captured it while hiking through the mountains and in their words bivvying—a new word for \"minimalist camping\" that I learned about five minutes ago. I'm jealous. Hiking through the Pyrenees and gazing at the stars at night sounds like a wonderful dream. The photographer told me they are no great astrophotographer, but that the skies were so dark and brilliant that even this single exposure photo taken with a Fuji X100 APS camera looks stunning.\n\n\"It's still one of my favorite starry skies memories from hiking the Haute Randonnée Pyrénéenne, a high mountain route going all the way coast to coast along the French-Spanish border,\" the photographer said. \"Because both the daytime and nighttime vistas there were just bloody marvelous.\"\n\nI have greatly enjoyed writing these Daily Telescope entries and seeing the amazing work you all have sent in. We've published everything from the very best images taken by NASA's space telescopes down to iPhone photos. We all share the skies, and see and document them in our own way. Thank you so much for your submissions; there have been many more than we can publish. But I treasure them all and your time in sending them in. I can't wait to see what delights the new year will bring. Until then, happy holidays, and may your stars be merry and bright.",

        "articleBody": "Xvideos, Pornhub, and Stripchat face curbs on age verification, content moderation.\n\nThree of the world’s biggest pornography sites will be hit with new regulatory curbs including stricter requirements on age verification, after EU regulators determined the adult platforms fell within the scope of a landmark law designed to police content online.\n\nXvideos, Pornhub, and Stripchat will be from April subject to the obligations of “very large online platforms” under the Digital Services Act (DSA), according to three people familiar with the move.\n\nThat designation applies to platforms with more than 45 million users and has so far been applied to tech groups such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and TikTok.\n\nThe adult websites caught by the legislation will be forced to comply with a series of stringent measures, including being forced to apply systems that can verify the age of users, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nOther measures include new responsibilities to take down illegal content. such as non-consensual videos, and becoming subject to external audits to ensure they comply with rules. An announcement on the EU’s decision is expected on Wednesday.\n\nThe three online porn platforms are among some of the world’s most visited sites. Xvideos alone has 160 million monthly visitors in the bloc, according to people familiar with EU regulators’ analysis, representing about a third of EU citizens.\n\nCompanies that fail to follow the new EU digital rules face fines of up to 6 percent of their global turnover.\n\nCanada-based Pornhub said it had only 33 million users in the EU and did not meet the DSA’s threshold. Stripchat, as well as Prague-headquartered Xvideos, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe DSA represents a landmark overhaul of the bloc’s digital rules. It sets new standards for policing hate speech, disinformation, and counterfeits online for large digital platforms. In April, the European Commission designated a total of 19 companies with special obligations under the law.\n\nEU regulators have used the law to open an official probe into Elon Musk’s X over its record of policing content related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and have sent requests to TikTok and YouTube to provide more information on their methods in regard to policing content.\n\nThierry Breton, the EU commissioner in charge of implementing the DSA, said: “I have been very clear that creating a safer online environment for our children is an enforcement priority under the DSA.”\n\nRegulators across the world have struggled to police so-called user-generated sites, which rely on individuals to post content and have been criticized for harboring harmful and illegal material.\n\nPorn sites have proven particularly difficult to rein in, as most of the large so-called tube sites, such as Pornhub and Xvideos, are owned by a handful of secretive companies.\n\nThe company behind Pornhub this year changed its name from MindGeek to Aylo, as it was bought by a freshly launched venture called Ethical Capital Partners that sought to distance itself from a string of scandals. One includes a US lawsuit where Pornhub, alongside Visa, is being accused of having profited from a video of a sexual nature featuring a minor.\n\nVisa at the time said it disagreed “strongly” with a court’s decision to dismiss its argument that allegations being tested had been based “entirely on the independent actions of parties other than Visa.” Pornhub has also denied allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nNo adult sites responded to the EU’s initial request for companies with more than 45 million users to come forward, according to three people close to the EU’s process. Regulators took several months to identify the three porn platforms as potentially falling within the requirements of the DSA, while deciding that several other popular adult websites did not.\n\nOther European countries have tried to regulate porn sites, with both France and Germany having taken steps to force adult companies to verify the age of users.",

        "title": "2024 Nissan Pathfinder Review: Deserves more attention than it gets",
        "authors": "James Riswick",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "Pros: High-quality interior; top-notch safety; easily accessed third row; competitive prices; above-average tow capacity; cool Rock Creek Edition\nCons: Worse to drive than rivals with odd steering response and weird ride with 20-inch wheels; less third-row space\n\nThe 2024 Nissan Pathfinder doesn’t get the attention it probably deserves, but it’s understandable. It gets overshadowed in the three-row family crossover segment by sales heavy hitters (Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot) and critical darlings (Kia Telluride, Hyundai Palisade). It also replaced a vehicle two years ago that was so uncompetitive and unmemorable that it managed to erase the word “Pathfinder” from the collective consciousness of would-be buyers, and to be honest, car reviewers. Ultimately, the fact that the Pathfinder isn’t quite as solid as those critical darlings and others means it falls short of being a class leader, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give it a chance.\n\nThere’s an awful lot to like. It looks great, especially with its available contrasting black roof and selection of bold, modern colors. The rugged Pathfinder Rock Creek Edition steps the style game up even further, while adding more capability than most such outdoor adventure trims. You may actually be able to find some paths with it! Ultimately, though, the Pathfinder is a family hauler, and for that purpose, it impresses with a modern, high-quality interior that boast easy-to-use controls and useful storage. Third-row space and cargo capacity aren’t as generous as the competitors mentioned above (minus the Highlander), but it’s still a three-row family crossover, and we’re ultimately talking about degrees of “big” here. Similarly, its competitors tend to be just a little bit better to drive.\n\nSo that’s really what we’re talking about here. The Pathfinder doesn’t quite make the podium, but it turns in a solid-enough performance that there’s a strong possibility that you might like what it brings to the table more than the others. There’s also the matter of pricing: the Pathfinder tends to ask less for comparable trim levels and, as it does fly under the radar, we wouldn’t be surprised if there are better deals to be found.\n\nWhat's new for 2024?\n\nThe Pathfinder is unchanged for 2024.\n\nWhat are the Pathfinder interior and in-car technology like?\n\nThis is the Pathfinder’s best attribute. Although the range-topping Platinum trim level pictured above in tan is its best foot forward, complete with handsome two-tone leather/pleather all over the place, even lower trim levels benefit from the same handsome design, thoughtful storage and user-friendly technology. General materials quality is average for the segment, which speaks to how good the segment is. \n\nThe center console features a vast pad to charge your smartphone, be it wired or wireless on upper trims, plus a smaller bin to prop up your phone should you prefer. The cupholders are big and versatile, the under-armrest and door bins are large, and there’s bonus storage under the console. You can also get a removable center console in between the available second-row captain’s chairs.\n\nA 9-inch touchscreen is standard on the SL and Platinum trim levels, and features a user interface that really nails a sweet spot of aesthetics and functionality. There are hard buttons and knobs, plus a stationary row of on-screen menu icons, which are always appreciated. The display itself is high resolution and features vibrant colors with attractive, legible graphics. It may not be ultra-wide (as in the Palisade and Telluride) or tall (Explorer), but it’s big enough, easy to see and works well. The 8-inch screen found in the S, SV and Rock Creek trims (pictured below with black interior) has fewer features to control and obviously is smaller, but its functionality is essentially the same.\n\nHow big is the Pathfinder?\n\nThe 2024 Pathfinder is basically the same size on the outside as the Palisade, Telluride, Subaru Ascent, etc. Differences inside are more noticeable, however, particularly in the third row where the seat is a little closer to the floor than you’d find in those mentioned above and therefore less spacious and comfortable. Nissan’s means of getting back there is better than most, however, as the second-row not only slides forward at the touch of a button (that’s quite common), but does so in a way that provides more space to squeeze back into the third-row and allows you to keep forward-facing child seats installed. That could easily be deal-sealer for some.\n\nCargo space behind the raised third row measures at 16.6 cubic-feet. On paper, that would make it barely better than the disappointing Toyota Highlander, but in practice, the Pathfinder’s boxy shape and useful under-floor storage actually help it carry more stuff than its specs would indicate. We could fit four medium-sized suitcases back there plus a duffle bag under the floor, but that still puts in mid-pack for the segment. You can see all of our real-world cargo tests for the segment here. Otherwise, the Pathfinder’s cargo area measures 45 cubic-feet with the third row lowered and 80.5 with both rear rows lowered, which are big enough that differences with competitors shouldn’t matter much.\n\nWhat are the Pathfinder's fuel economy and performance specs?\n\nEvery Pathfinder comes with a 3.5-liter V6 and a nine-speed automatic. It produces 284 horsepower and 259 pound-feet of torque in most trims, but the Rock Creek Edition gets a little more oomph with 295 hp and 270 lb-ft. Front-wheel drive is standard on all trims but the Rock Creek. It comes standard with the same all-wheel-drive system that’s optional on the other trims.\n\nFuel economy depends on drivetrain and trim level. Front-wheel drive models get 20 mpg city, 27 mpg highway and 23 mpg combined, while the AWD S, SV and SL curiously get just a bit better at 21/27/23. Can’t see we’ve seen that before. The Platinum goes down to 20/25/22 with AWD, while the Rock Creek is in the basement at 20/23/21. There’s a price to be paid for its cool all-terrain tires and roof rack.\n\nTowing capacity is 6,000 pounds with AWD (it’s 3,500 with FWD), which is considerably better than the segment’s norm of 5,000 pounds or less. The standard tow hitch on AWD models is also handy for hitch-mounted bike racks and gear solutions.\n\nWhat's the Pathfinder like to drive?\n\nAt best, the Pathfinder delivers what’s expected for the segment. It doesn’t stand out, but it also doesn’t have irritating habits like its bland, squishy predecessor. In particular, it’s hard to find fault with the naturally aspirated V6 that delivers solid power and the nine-speed automatic that fades into the background.\n\nHowever, the steering effort and response never feels quite right – perhaps a tad too slow given the amount of effort. The Platinum’s 20-inch wheels also produce an usual ride that combine a firm response to harsher impacts with a relaxed response to large bumps and undulations. We’d avoid that trim, but honestly, we have not tested an S, SV or SL to see how much of a difference there is. We have driven a Rock Creek, however, and can report that its all-terrain tires keep the ride and interior noise well within the realm of comfort even though there are degradations in both areas. You’ll also find it to be far more civilized on-road than a Toyota 4Runner, for instance.\n\nOff-road, that ancient Toyota will make a mockery of its one-time apples-to-apples competitor that has since become a three-row crossover. Nevertheless, the Rock Creek’s upgrades are definitely improvements over what you’d get in other Pathfinder trims should you frequent campsites or other outdoor spots. You also won’t suffer if you’re mostly attracted to its cooler looks.\n\nWhat is the 2024 Pathfinder's price?\n\nThe Pathfinder generally costs a bit less than its rivals. The Rock Creek Edition in particular is much cheaper than similar outdoor adventure trim levels like the Honda Pilot TrailSport, Ford Explorer Timberline and Kia Telluride X-Pro. As such, it’s the Pathfinder’s most competitive version.\n\nThe Rock Creek Edition is also the most distinctive version as all other trims represent the usual ladder-type escalation of equipment and upgrades with each version. The Rock Creek is ultimately a mid-grade model in terms of equipment, but gains a modest, 0.6-inch ground clearance lift to 7.7 inches, an off-road-tuned suspension, beadlock-looking 18-inch wheels, Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires, lots of matte black body cladding, and a platform-style roof rack. Oh, and lots and lots of Rock Creek badges.\n\nAll prices below include the $1,365 destination charge. All-wheel drive is a $1,900 option for all trim levels but the Rock Creek, which includes it as standard.\n\nS: $37,345\nSV: $40,165\nSL: $43,765\nRock Creek: $45,165\nPlatinum: $50,315\n\n2023 Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek\n2023 Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek\nView 50 Photos\n\nWhat are the Pathfinder's safety ratings and driver assistance features?\n\nEvery 2024 Pathfinder includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking that detects pedestrians and cyclists; rear automatic braking (a rare feature); blind-spot and rear cross-traffic warning (usually optional); and lane-departure warning. Steering intervention for the blind-spot and lane-departure system is added on all but the base S. The top three trims also have Nissan ProPilot Assist, the advanced adaptive cruise control system that adds well-executed steering assist system. You have to keep a hand on the wheel, but the car does most of the work.\n\nThe NHTSA gave the Pathfinder five out of five stars for overall and side crash protection, and four stars for frontal and rollover protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Pathfinder a Top Safety Pick+ for its best-possible scores in all crash test and crash prevention categories. Its headlights were rated “Acceptable.”",

        "articleBody": "What's the best car for snow? The real answer is \"the one with winter tires.\"\n\nWhat do we mean by that? You could have the finest, most advanced all-wheel-drive system or four-wheel drive in the world, but if you're running all-seasons (the spork of tires), your fancy four-wheeler won't matter much. The odds are, any vehicle on the road running good winter tires will probably perform adequately in slippery, slushy and/or snowy road conditions. (Here's a more complete explanation of why winter tires are totally worth it).\n\nIn other words, you don't really need any of the cars on this list. With a set of winter tires, countless others will do the job, and even these will be at their best with proper rubber. You can find a variety of winter tires for your car here at Tire Rack. Keep in mind that you will need a full set of four snow tires for safety and performance, no matter what you're driving. The days of your dad putting just two snows on the family truckster to get it moving in a straight line are long gone.\n\nDon't get us wrong, getting a car that performs well in snow and ice is still a worthy criteria for car buyers. According to the U.S. Transportation Department, 70% of Americans live in places that get snow and ice. And much of the country has been blasted with arctic air for much of the new year.\n\nSo let's look at the cars. First, we're highlighting choices for a variety of buyers and price points. Second, we're not just considering snow; we're considering general wintery conditions people will experience driving to work or school. As such, these are all choices with advanced all-wheel-drive systems, usually with \"torque-vectoring\" systems that not only automatically shunt power front and back, but side to side between the rear axles. Most have extra ground clearance for getting through deep snow, and we prefer those vehicles with more responsive steering, throttles and transmissions that provide a greater sense of vehicle control in slippery conditions. \n\nAcura RDX\nRead our Acura RDX Review\n\nAcura's Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system was one of the first to offer torque-vectoring, and besides often being touted for its ability to greatly enhanced dry-road handling, its benefits in the slick stuff can be profound. It's actually surprising that Acura hasn't leaned into this capability further by offering more rugged versions of its vehicles. Still, the RDX is our Acura of choice here because of its greater ground clearance and its positioning in the most popular luxury SUV segment. \n\nAudi A4 Allroad\nRead our Audi A4 Allroad Review\n\nAudi's Quattro all-wheel-drive systems have long been some of the best in the industry, so any number of the company's models will serve you better than most. We selected the Allroad here, however, because its lower center of gravity, smaller dimensions and greater agility relative most small SUVs provide an immense amount of confidence in slick conditions. Also, this author in particular knows from personal experience in multiple blizzards how good and confident an Allroad can be. \n\n2022 Chevy Silverado line\n4x4 full-size trucks\n\nRead our review of the Ram 1500, Ford F-150 and our previews of the revised 2022 Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra.\n\nDuh, of course a big-old 4x4 truck is going to ace clawing through deep snow. However, this list is about day-to-day driving more than extreme scenarios, and also, we're talking about the best rather than just capable. In that spirit, let's talk about the best-possible trucks for day-to-day driving in snow. For that, you should look for a truck with an automated four-wheel-drive system, known as Auto or 4A mode. This effectively allows the truck to operate like an all-wheel-drive vehicle, sending power to the front axle as needed. This is in contrast to just driving around in 4Hi \"just in case\" you come across slippery conditions, which in short can lead to excessive wear of expensive vehicle components. So which trucks to look for? Every 4x4 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra has an Auto mode, so whichever trim level works for you. All Ram 1500 trim levels but the Tradesman and Rebel have a 4A mode, while all F-150s from Lariat onward have 4A, meaning only the priciest versions get it.  \n\nFord Bronco Sport\nRead our Ford Bronco Sport Review\n\nThe range-topping Bronco Sport Badlands has a more advanced, torque-vectoring all-wheel drive system we wish were available on other trim levels. Still, all those other trims come standard with all-wheel drive, more ground clearance than most and a Slippery drive mode that calibrates various vehicle controls and systems for improved response on ice and snow. If looking for a small SUV, the Bronco Sport will be better than most during the winter. \n\n2019 Honda Pilot\nHonda Pilot\nRead our Honda Pilot Review\n\nAgain, it's all about the all-wheel-drive system. The Pilot, along with its Passport and Ridgeline siblings, offer what is effectively a previous-generation version of Acura's torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system (see Acura RDX above). This gives it a leg-up on most of its three-row crossover SUV competitors. We also like that it includes a dedicated Snow mode, and that it's a bit more responsive to inputs (especially compared to the Subaru Ascent). Although the Pilot is getting on in years and is far from our top overall choice in its segment, when it comes to performance in ice and snow, it scores big. \n\nJeep Grand Cherokee\nRead our Jeep Grand Cherokee Review\n\nThe Grand Cherokee and its seven-passenger Jeep Grand Cherokee L sibling are ready to tackle far more extreme conditions than most of their competitors. Among its three four-wheel-drive systems, the top-of-the-line Quadra-Drive II that's standard on the Trailhawk and Summit, and optional on the Overland, includes an electronic limited-slip differential for the rear axle that enhances traction beyond the two Quadra-Trac four-wheel-drive systems. (Don't worry too much about the technical differences between all- and four-wheel drive. When they operate automatically, as these do, it really doesn't matter). The top JGC trim levels also include the Quadra-Lift air suspension, which as the name implies, cranks the ride height up -- from 8.4 to 10.9 inches in the Overland, Summit and Trailhawk 4xe, and 11.3 in the gas-only Trailhawks. It's rare for any crossover to crack the 8-inch mark. Jeep also includes a snow-specific Selec-Terrain drive mode as standard on all but the base Laredo.\n\nLand Rover Defender\nRead our Land Rover Defender Review\n\nThe Defender is a beast, capable of tackling just about anything thrown at it, especially when compared to similarly priced luxury SUVs. Importantly, it also has more reassuring control inputs than other dedicated off-roaders (Jeep Wrangler, Ford Bronco), which is a benefit in icy conditions. As for snow in particular, its standard air suspension lets you raise the Defender from 8.6 inches (higher than most SUVs) to a lofty 11.5 inches. Its off-road-intended camera systems should also come in handy while making sure you don't run into anything unfortunate covered in snow. \n\nLand Rover Range Rover\nRead our latest Range Rover Road Test\n\nThe Range Rover may not be as capable as the Defender, but many of the same attributes are present: height-adjustable suspension, snow-specific drive mode, off-road camera systems and better handling relative other off-roaders. That it's an impeccably crafted super-luxury vehicle that'll have you beating winter in the utmost comfort is icing on the icy cake. If we needed a vehicle to routinely ferry us to the local ski resort, it's hard to think of a more appropriate vehicle.\n\nMazda CX-50\nRead our Mazda CX-50 Review\n\nWhile it's not ten times better than its stablemate, the Mazda CX-5, the CX-50 is a bit larger, which leads to improved stability. It also offers a surprising amount of ground clearance (between 8.3 and 8.6 inches depending on trim), so you're less likely to get hung up in deeper snow. As an added bonus, it's a Mazda, so it'll be fun to drive even when you don't need its inherent utility. What's not to like? Well, the infotainment, we suppose, but what the CX-50 lacks in tech, it makes up for in engagement. \n\n \n\nRivian R1T and R1S\nRead our Rivian R1T Review\n\nWith individual motors at each wheel, the Rivian R1T truck and R1S SUV take torque-vectoring to a whole other level. It also has all-terrain tires (not the same as winters, but definitely capable in snow), an absurd 6.5 inches of ride height adjustment that takes it up to a towering 14.9 inches, and a surprisingly low center of gravity and exceptional handling that make it more reassuring to drive in inclement weather than other big trucks and SUVs. Interestingly, there's no dedicated snow mode among its eight drive modes. We should also mention that among electric vehicles, the Rivian's lengthy range of 314 miles means you'll still be left with quite a lot after the inevitable reduction caused by cold temperatures. \n\nSubaru Crosstrek\nRead our Subaru Crosstrek Review\n\nTake a humble compact hatchback with standard all-wheel drive and add an almost comical amount of ground clearance. That's the Subaru Crosstrek. From Vermont to Colorado and up to Alaska, it's not just shrewd marketing that sees Subaru so popular in snowy climates. They are genuinely snow-ready (in large part to the Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system that continually routes power to all wheels rather than just reacting to slippage), and also well-suited for carrying gear should you be driving to the snow rather than just doing your best to suffer through it. Although any Suburu not named BRZ would be better in this regard than most cars, the Crosstrek stands out because it's available at such a low price ($24,920 for an automatic-equipped base car) and gets substantially better fuel economy than everything else on this list. Besides its standard AWD and lofty ground clearance (8.7 inches is taller than most SUVs and the same as the Forester, Outback and Ascent), the Crosstrek can be enhanced with a Deep Snow/Mud setting in the Sport trim level that also adds the much better 2.5-liter engine. \n\n2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness with Mt Jefferson\nSubaru Forester\n\nRead our Subaru Forester Review\n\nThe Subaru Outback is pretty good, too, but we prefer the Forester's more responsive steering when confronting sloppy conditions. The Forester is also a compact SUV, versus whatever wagon/crossover/other description you prefer for the Outback, which makes it more relevant for the SUV-hungry buying public. Much of what we wrote above regarding the Crosstrek applies here, but in a bigger package. Its Deep Snow/Mud mode is also standard on most trim levels, and there's the new Forester Wilderness (pictured above) that really steps things up with even more ground clearance, standard all-terrain tires (not the same as winter tires admittedly) and water-resistant interior surfaces. Among compact SUVs, this is your best snow bet.\n\nToyota RAV4 Adventure, Limited and TRD Off-Road\nRead our Toyota RAV4 Review\n\nUnlike the Forester, choosing the RAV4 here comes with the caveat that it depends on the trim level. Both the Adventure and TRD Off-Road (pictured above) come with extra ground clearance and more capable tires, plus a Snow drive mode and, crucially, a more advanced torque-vectoring all-wheel drive system. Those latter two items are also included on the Limited trim level. So, the RAV4 can be one of the best choices, or it can be a perfectly acceptable choice (including the RAV4 hybrids, which are all all-wheel drive). \n\n2020 Volvo V60 Cross Country\nVolvo V60 Cross Country\n\nLike the Audi A4 Allroad, the V60 Cross Country is a lifted wagon that provides greater capability than the typical car and more reassuring handling than the typical SUV. All-wheel drive is standard and there's an appreciable increase in ground clearance. It's also a Volvo, and if anyone is going to know how to make a car for snow, it's the Swedes. So really, any Volvo is a great choice.\n\nThis author actually drove the V60 Cross Country near the Arctic circle in Sweden, taking laps on a road course set out on the frozen Baltic Sea and traversing backwoods roads covered in ice. Sure, I drove into a ditch, but sometimes not even the gnarliest, studded winter tires can save you from the terrors of winter. \n\nVolvo V90 Cross Country\n\nThe V90 Cross Country is more comfortable, spacious, refined and powerful than its V60 sibling. It's also a far more capable wagon than its Audi A6 Allroad and Mercedes-Benz E 450 All-Terrain competitors, which have barely any practical advantage over a regular old wagon. By contrast, the V90 Cross Country rides much higher and will do a better job of clearing deep snow. As a wagon, though, its lower center of gravity can make you feel a little more connected to the road ... or rather, ice. Also, its lower roof makes it much easier to load skis onto a rack or carrier, just in case you're purposely driving into the snow rather than simply surviving it.",

        "articleBody": "His plans involve opening a primary and secondary school that will evolve into a full-fledged university.\n\nIn October of 2021, Elon Musk tweeted his plans to open a Texas university complete with “epic merch” and tuition paid in his favored cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. Although it was unclear at the time whether the billionaire’s comments were a joke, his intention to build a school in the state has now been confirmed.\n\nThe Tesla (TSLA) CEO is funneling $100 million towards the creation of an Austin-based school, according to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filing by The Foundation, one of Musk’s charitable entities. Its IRS application for tax-exempt status was approved in March and maps out Musk’s plan to open a primary and secondary school that will ultimately evolve into a full-fledged university, as first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe school will specialize in STEM subjects and start off with an enrollment of around 50 students, combining formal instruction with “hands-on learning experience including simulations, case studies, fabrication/design projects and labs,” according to the application. It is currently seeking accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.\n\nAs of October 2022, the school was in the process of hiring an executive director, teachers and administrators. It will be tuition-free, having allotted $2 million in scholarship funding for its inaugural year, and will award need-based scholarships to students if tuition is later charged at the primary, secondary or university levels.\n\nMembers of Musk’s inner circle like Jared Birchall, Musk’s wealth manager; Ronald Gong and Teresa Holland, employees at the Musk-linked financial services company Catalyst Family Office; and Steven Chidester, a tax attorney at Withersworldwide, are listed as school trustees.\n \nWhat would a school run by Elon Musk look like?\n\nMusk, currently the world’s richest person with an estimated net worth of $254.9 billion, hasn’t shied away from sharing his thoughts on university education in the past. Discipline and social interaction are the primary benefits of secondary education, he said at a Satellite conference in 2020. “I don’t consider college evidence of exceptional ability,” said the billionaire of his hiring process at Tesla. “In fact, ideally you dropped out.”\n\nThis nontraditional approach towards education was reflected in Ad Astra, a small experimental school Musk created in 2014 to educate his own children and those of some SpaceX employees. “The regular schools weren’t doing what I thought should be done,” said Musk of the venture in 2015. Ad Astra, which takes its name from the Latin phrase for “to the stars,” was located in SpaceX’s California headquarters and emphasized technical projects instead of formal assessments and grading. With a focus on STEM and issues like the rise of artificial intelligence, the school’s 2018 curriculum included subjects such as environmental policy, space exploration and North Korea. The physical school shut down in 2020, branching off into online education.\n\nMusk has also supported schools in Texas, the state he’s called home most recently. In 2021, he pledged to donate $20 million towards schools in Cameron County, Texas plus $10 million to revitalize the nearby city of Brownsville. And the billionaire has previously given millions of dollars to the online educational platform Khan Academy, which was used by Ad Astra students for self-guided courses.\n\nMuch of Musk’s philanthropic activity involves the Musk Foundation, which he founded in 2002 alongside his brother Kimball. The organization, which received a staggering $5.7 billion in Tesla shares from Musk in 2021, focuses on renewable energy, space exploration, pediatric science, science and engineering education and the development of safe A.I. Some of the tech mogul’s most significant donations to date include a $100 million gift towards a carbon capture technology prize and a $10 million donation to support population research programs at the University of Texas at Austin.",

        "articleBody": "Tucker Carlson is entering the world of streaming. According to the Wall Street Journal, the former FOX (FOXA) News host launched his own streaming service today (Dec. 11). The Tucker Carlson Network (TCN) costs $9 monthly and will host five shows by midweek.   \n\nSince his ousting from Fox News in April, the conservative commentator has found new ways to grab mainstream attention. At its peak in October 2020, right before the presidential election, his primetime show Tucker Carlson Tonight was the most-watched show on cable, with 5,36 million viewers that month. After being fired, he began a new show on X, formerly Twitter, and later teamed up with conservative political advisor Neil Patel to start a media company. The two founded the conservative news company, The Daily Caller, in 2010, which Carlson left in 2020 while Patel remained at the helm. \n\nCarlson is not the first among his Fox peers to start his own media company. Former hosts Megyn Kelly and Bill O’Reilly have also gone out on their own independently from Fox. The Megyn Kelly Show is a podcast hosted by Sirius XM. Her YouTube channel has 1.5 million subscribers. O’Reilly’s digital company and show No Spin News offers a premium subscription of $6.95 per month. \n\nAccording to the original report, the shows on TCN will vary from interviews to short-form content and monologues. Carlson will also launch a podcast called The Tucker Carlson Podcast, reportedly backed by the same advertising company as Kelly and O’Reilly’s companies, Red Sea Ventures. He’s also slated to speak with Carlson today with more details about his streaming service. \n\nCarlson interviewed many contentious figures while on Fox, including Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, and Elon Musk, whose platform X hosted Carlson’s show after he left Fox. \n\nAfter starting his show on X, Carlson’s interview subjects have ranged from former president Donald Trump to rapper Ice Cube. It’s difficult to determine how many views his programs on X received by looking at the posts since Elon Musk removed the video views tally, but a report from NBC News found data that Carlson’s first episode on X was viewed 26 million times. Carlson’s interview with Donald Trump was viewed 14.8 million times, according to Mashable. Carlson’s interview with Andrew Tate, an internet influencer charged with human trafficking, is among his most controversial. His popularity and high viewership are often met with concern from critics as he uses his platform to endorse public figures accused of sexual assault, trafficking and misogyny, like Tate and Russell Brand.\n\nAside from his show guests, Carlson’s messaging and personal views, which often invoke racist, misogynist rhetoric and conspiracy theories, are a large part of his identity as a broadcaster. He was one of the public figures who upheld the conspiracy that President Joe Biden stole the last election from Trump, he’s spoken out against Black Lives Matter, made racist and xenophobic comments against people like Rep. Ilhan Omar and denied that climate change exists.",

        "articleBody": "It seems like Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill will be on the field for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after missing last week's contest against the New York Jets with an ankle injury.\n\nHead coach Mike McDaniel told reporters the wide receiver \"has had a good week, no setbacks... feel good about him.\"\n\nHill, 29, has largely stayed healthy for the Dolphins in his two seasons in Miami, playing all 17 games in 2022 and only missing the Week 15 win over the Jets this season.\n\nWhen he's been on the field he's been essentially unstoppable, with head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa helping him to unlock a new level. In his first season with the team he posted 119 catches for 1,710 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nHe's on pace to smash those marks, registering 97 catches for 1,542 yards and 12 touchdowns in just 13 appearances this season. That has many people hyping him as a potential MVP candidate, something a wide receiver has never achieved, though the expectation is that a quarterback—potentially Tagovailoa—will claim the award.\n\nNonetheless, Hill has been an absolute menace and should be in the running for the Offensive Player of the Year award, which likely will come down to either him or San Francisco 49ers' running back Christian McCaffrey.\n\nHill's ability to stretch defenses with his otherworldly speed and turn short catches into long touchdowns makes him a uniquely gifted playmaker, and one who is essentially impossible to replace. In his absence in Week 15, however, Jaylen Waddle (eight catches for 142 yards and a score) stepped up in a big way.",

        "articleBody": "Heavyweight sluggers Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder are set to face different opponents on Saturday at the Day of Reckoning: Fight Night in Saudi Arabia, but they reportedly finally agreed to fight each other.\n\nAccording to boxing insider Dan Rafael, Joshua and Wilder have agreed to \"all terms\" on a two-fight deal, and they're expected to sign the contracts ahead of Saturday's event.\n\nRafael added that \"the outline of a deal, including the financial terms\" for a mega fight between Joshua and Wilder on March 9 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia was \"agreed to more than a week ago.\" However, \"there were still a variety of open issues.\"\n\nThe two fighters came to terms after a meeting with officials from Riyadh Season, which has bankrolled the major fights in Saudi Arabia. It was noted that their fight is contingent upon both of them winning their respective bouts at Day of Reckoning.\n\nJoshua will be facing Otto Wallin and Wilder will be facing Joseph Parker in the headlining bouts of Saturday's fight card. Joshua will be seeking his third win of the year after his wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius, the latter of which came by seventh-round knockout. Wilder hasn't fought in 14 months, last defeating Helenius by first-round knockout in October 2022.\n\nWilder and Joshua have been circling each other for quite some time, and they've even taken shots at each other in the buildup to Saturday's event instead of focusing on their opponents. Wilder called Joshua \"a nervous wreck\" after they were near one another at a recent press conference.\n\n\"For me, he was all nervous,\" Wilder said. \"Nerves when it comes to me, because they don't know how I am. They don't know how I am in different situations, so when I came in that relaxed manner it really shocked him. And it shocked a lot of people.\"\n\nHowever, Wilder went on to add that he wishes success for Joshua because he knows the bigger fight is on the horizon.\n\n\"He's got to get Wallin out the way and I've got to get Parker out the way and may God be with us in those fights and when we come out safe we let the big games begin,\" Wilder said.",

        "articleBody": "As Google continues to update its algorithms, the use of content has never been more crucial, and this article explains how you can use it to build authority \n\nWhether you are new to SEO or an experienced SEO junkie, one cannot deny the importance of content to rank well on search engines such as Google and Bing.\n\nGoogle has often referred to the notion that ‘content is king’ and have made the use of content very key to their algorithms over the years. Such as E-E-A-T update (expertise, experience, authority, and trustworthiness) and last month’s Google Helpful Content Update which either rewarded or downgraded websites based on the quality and helpfulness of their content.\n\nWith this in mind, we speak to some industry experts and growing businesses to understand how they use content to build authority in their industry.\nCreate guides with statistics\n\n“For a new or existing brand, it is always helpful to add blog posts and guides to their website,” explains Richard Allan, co-founder of energy startup, Warmable.\n\n“Having lots of content shows that you have substance and a website with 50 pages and posts is likely to outrank a site with just 5 or 10.”\n\nHowever, making this content statistic driven and honing in on real things that people are looking for is a very good way to gain authority.\n\n“So rather than adding the top 10 tips for this or how to save money on that, consider phrases such as these below and be sure to add key statistics high up the page and in the meta-data to make it stand out in the SERPs.”\n\n    What percentage of people use ….\n    What is the number of people that …\n    How many people do / do not ….\n    How much money can be saved by …\n    How many people in the US/UK are …\n    How much is this (name) industry worth?\n    How many people in the US use …\n\n“A lot of users and indeed journalists are looking for that killer statistic, so you need to be able to show it very early and clearly and have it backed up by a strong source.”\n\n“You will also find that this helps with natural link building because if you rank top for a good phrase or statistical-based question, a journalist will naturally link to you and very often they just take one of the first sources that they see on Google as fact. You would be surprised how many simple and quality links you could generate.”\n\nThe layout of the content is key\n\n“How you present your content is very important,” explains Justine Gray of content platform, Trending Impact. \n\nTo be truly educational, authoritative and informative, you have to make the content very palatable and easy to digest. This can be as simple as adding key bullet points in the beginning of the piece of content to give an overview, using short paragraphs to make clear points and using graphs or images with data to make it stand out. Importantly, you need to get into the information early on and avoid waffling for the sake of increasing the word count.\n\n“A nice feature to organise your text includes using accordion tabs for FAQs, dropdown menus and clickable tabs at the top of the page that take you straight to the desired section,” says Gray.\nUse people and use authority figures\n\nGoogle has added more weighting to the use of authors, guest writers and real expertise behind any guides or blog posts.\n\nWith reference to the recent Google Helpful Content Update, webmasters will gain greater authority from having a real face or team member clearly stated as the author on a piece of content, including landing pages and blog posts. \n\nSaying things such as ‘reviewed by’ and ‘edited by’ will add a lot of credibility, especially if it has a bio which includes relevant qualifications or suggests years of experience – and this is perfect for medical and financial industries. \n\nAdditionally, authors can add their Linkedin and Twitter profile to their bio for added effect.\n\n“We have found that using guest writers who are experts in their fields adds great value,” explains Dr Max Linden, founder of The Hawker Online. “Finding people who run companies, have followers or like putting themselves out there is a good place to start.\n\n“Not only is guest and expertly contributed content more insightful and personable, but you can share it on your social network and theirs too to maximize reach.”\n\nDon’t just use text, use video\n\n“As we all know today, content is not just textual but highly visual,” informs Dean Benzaken, co-founder of Techvolutionary.\n\n“With the help of AI, there are a lot of ways to take your existing content and quickly turn it into voice notes that people can click and hear on the page.”\n\nIn addition, videos add great value to any piece of content, and you have some superb tools to help you facilitate this today. So, if you have a long video, you can use Opus to break it down into 10 smaller videos with captions included, or you can use Synthesia to create an AI avatar to auto-generate the text. The opportunities are vast to make your content standout and to create authority in your space.",

        "articleBody": "Discover 5 must-know factors for successful content optimization, including the emerging technologies and significance of audience behavior. \n\n30-second summary:\n\n    As the content battleground goes through tremendous upheaval, SEO insights will continue to grow in importance\n    ChatGPT can help content marketers get an edge over their competition by efficiently creating and editing high-quality content\n    Making sure your content rank high enough to engage the target audience requires strategic planning and implementation\n\nGoogle is constantly testing and updating its algorithms in pursuit of the best possible searcher experience. As the search giant explains in its ‘How Search Works’ documentation, that means understanding the intent behind the query and bringing back results that are relevant, high-quality, and accessible for consumers.\n\nAs if the constantly shifting search landscape weren’t difficult enough to navigate, content marketers are also contending with an increasingly technology-charged environment. Competitors are upping the stakes with tools and platforms that generate smarter, real-time insights and even make content optimization and personalization on the fly based on audience behavior, location, and data points.\n\nSet-it-and-forget-it content optimization is a thing of the past. Here’s what you need to know to help your content get found, engage your target audience, and convert searchers to customers in 2023.\n\nAI automation going to be integral for content optimization\n\nAs the content battleground heats up, SEO insights will continue to grow in importance as a key source of intelligence. We’re optimizing content for humans, not search engines, after all – we had better have a solid understanding of what those people need and want.\n\nWhile I do not advocate automation for full content creation, I believe next year – as resources become stretched automation will have a bigger impact on helping with content optimization of existing content.\n\nCHATGPT\n\nChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful language generation model that leverages the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture to produce realistic human-like text. With Chat GPT’s wide range of capabilities – from completing sentences and answering questions to generating content ideas or powering research initiatives – it can be an invaluable asset for any Natural Language Processing project.\n\nThe introduction on ChatGPT has caused considerable debate and explosive amounts of content on the web. With ChatGPT, content marketers can achieve an extra edge over their competition by efficiently creating and editing high-quality content. It offers assistance with generating titles for blog posts, summaries of topics or articles, as well as comprehensive campaigns when targeting a specific audience.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that this technology should be used to enhance human creativity rather than completely replacing it.\n\nFor many years now AI-powered technology has been helping content marketers and SEOs automate repetitive tasks such as data analysis, scanning for technical issues, and reporting, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. AI also enables real-time analysis of a greater volume of consumer touchpoints and behavioral data points for smarter, more precise predictive analysis, opportunity forecasting, real-time content recommendations, and more.\n\nWith so much data in play and recession concerns already impacting 2023 budgets in many organizations, content marketers will have to do more with less this coming year. You’ll need to carefully balance human creative resources with AI assists where they make sense to stay flexible, agile, and ready to respond to the market.\n\nIt’s time to look at your body of content as a whole\n\nGoogle’s Helpful Content update, which rolled out in August, is a sitewide signal targeting a high proportion of thin, unhelpful, low-quality content. That means the exceptional content on your site won’t rank to their greatest potential if they’re lost in a sea of mediocre, outdated assets.\n\nIt might be time for a content reboot – but don’t get carried away. Before you start unpublishing and redirecting blog posts, lean on technology for automated site auditing and see what you can fix up first. AI-assisted technology can help sniff out on-page elements, including page titles and H1 tags, and off-page factors like page speed, redirects, and 404 errors that can support your content refreshing strategy.\n\nFocus on your highest trafficked and most visible pages first, i.e.: those linked from the homepage or main menu. Google’s John Mueller confirmed recently that if the important pages on your website are low quality, it’s bad news for the entire site. There’s no percentage by which this is measured, he said, urging content marketers and SEOs to instead think of what the average user would think when they visit your website.\n\nTake advantage of location-based content optimization opportunities\n\nConsumers crave personalized experiences, and location is your low-hanging fruit. Seasonal weather trends, local events, and holidays all impact your search traffic in various ways and present opportunities for location-based optimization.\n\nAI-assisted technology can help you discover these opportunities and evaluate topical keywords at scale so you can plan content campaigns and promotions that tap into this increased demand when it’s happening.\n\nMake the best possible use of content created for locally relevant campaigns by repurposing and promoting it across your website, local landing pages, social media profiles, and Google Business Profiles for each location. Google Posts, for example, are a fantastic and underutilized tool for enhancing your content’s visibility and interactivity right on the search results page.\n\nOptimize content with conversational & high-volume keywords\n\nLook for conversational and trending terms in your keyword research, too. Top-of-funnel keywords that help generate awareness of the topic and spur conversations in social channels offer great opportunities for promotion. Use hashtags organically and target them in paid content promotion campaigns to dramatically expand your audience.\n\nConversational keywords are a good opportunity for enhancing that content’s visibility in search, too. Check out the ‘People Also Ask’ results and other featured snippets available on the search results page (SERP) for your keyword terms. Incorporate questions and answers in your content to naturally optimize for these and voice search queries.\n\nIt’s important that you utilize SEO insights and real-time data correctly; you don’t want to be targeting what was trending last month and is already over. AI is a great assist here, as well, as an intelligent tool can be scanning and analyzing constantly, sending recommendations for new content opportunities as they arise.\n\nConsider how you optimize content based on intent and experience\n\nThe best content comes from a deep, meaningful understanding of the searcher’s intent. What problem were they experiencing or what need did they have that caused them to seek out your content in the first place? And how does your blog post, ebook, or landing page copy enhance their experience?\n\nLook at the search results page as a doorway to your “home”. How’s your curb appeal? What do potential customers see when they encounter one of your pages in search results? What kind of experience do you offer when they step over the threshold and click through to your website?\n\nThe best content meets visitors where they are at with relevant, high-quality information presented in a way that is accessible, fast loading, and easy to digest. This is the case for both short and long form SEO content. Ensure your content contains calls to action designed to give people options and help them discover the next step in their journey versus attempting to sell them on something they may not be ready for yet.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe audience is king, queen, and the entire court as we head into 2023. SEO and content marketing give you countless opportunities to connect with these people but remember they are a means to an end. Keep searcher intent and audience needs at the heart of every piece of content you create and campaign you plan for the coming year.",

        "articleBody": "Imagine you’re practicing with a band and someone walks in with a new instrument. You and your pals will probably want to check it out, see how you might jam with it. You probably wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that your guitar is obsolete and this is the end of music.\n\nYet this is how we’re reacting to the latest innovation in artificial intelligence. We grew up with Frankenstein, HAL 9000, Her, and similar stories where artificial intelligence runs amok. That archetype is deeply ingrained but the reality is that humans have adapted to every single technological innovation. Yes, there are always downsides to technology, but none of them have led to the end of civilization. So let’s take a collective breath and resist AI xenophobia.\n\nI’ve been a skeptic about AI for over 40 years. By day, I’m director of a robotics lab at the University of California, Berkeley, but I’m also an artist. I’ve always said that AI would never be creative; it wouldn’t come up with an interesting work of art, an interesting invention, or a funny joke. But just after Thanksgiving, the awkwardly named ChatGPT went online. After using it for a few hours I thought: “What if I’ve been wrong?”\n\nChatGPT and other generative models are a significant advance in AI. The scientists and artists I respect most are approaching the latest advance in AI with curiosity, not fear. What new inventions can it generate? What new songs can it write? What can we learn from it and how can we collaborate with it? I’m not worried that AI will steal our jobs, undermine the economy, or spawn an unintended global Armageddon. And I’m not worried about making mistakes: all scientists make conjectures and all artists take poetic license.\n\nI didn’t sign the petition to pause AI because its creative potential is vastly more interesting than crisis messaging. Novelty and diversity in backgrounds, abilities, talents, and perspectives have always been crucial to discovering new inventions and art forms. The world thrives on coexistence, not a “winner-take-all” Darwinian totalitarianism.\n\nSix hundred years ago, almost everyone believed that humans were at the center of the universe, that the sun, moon, and stars revolved around Earth. When Galileo figured out the formula for grinding lenses, he looked up and saw moons revolving around Jupiter. Everything didn’t revolve around us. The Catholic Church excommunicated him, but the Copernican revolution prevailed and humans accepted that Earth is not the center of the universe.\n\nThe same math behind the telescope led to the microscope and the discovery of human cells and microbes — entire worlds lurking right under our noses. These discoveries were so surprising that people started questioning everything they thought they knew. Rene´ Descartes applied scientific skepticism to question his own existence. He found one thing that cannot be denied: “cogito ergo sum”: I think therefore I am.\n\nThe human mind became the measure of all things; our remarkable ability to reason systematically — the scientific method. The “Enlightenment” took off and produced centuries of discoveries and innovations, many that appeared at first magical, from electricity to photography, from the airplane to the spaceship, from the double-helix to the cellphone. These technologies changed how we viewed ourselves and the world around us. They enhanced our confidence in our own scientific power.\n\nNow a new revolution is brewing. Recent advances in AI are forcing us to ask: What if humankind’s ability to reason, to think, can be performed by AI? For some kinds of thinking, like recognizing speech, identifying items in photographs, and playing Go, AI delighted us. Those advances were impressive, but for the most part they addressed relatively narrow problems.\n\nChatGPT goes beyond impersonations, witty poems, and limericks. When prompted properly, it can generate new and interesting stories, jokes, and inventions. I gave it the standard creativity tests, asking it to list 100 creative uses for a rubber band, then a bottle cap, etc. It passed with flying colors; for example here are some uses it suggested for a guitar pick: screwdriver, bookmark, jewelry, opening a letter, cleaning sneaker treads, opening a can, scraping ice off a windshield, and a miniature sail for a toy boat.\n\nI didn’t think I’d see that in my lifetime.\n\nChatGPT is expressing creativity. But it is not human creativity. We know there are many forms of creativity; even birds invent new songs. But ChatGPT is the first artificial creativity.\n\nLet’s not suppress AI like the Catholic Church leaders did to Galileo 600 years ago. Galileo taught us to question our beliefs, so we should also question our fears. Let’s engage with AI and explore how it can combine and extend previous ideas, how it can help us learn new things, design new molecules, new medicines, new works of art. Instead of kicking it out of the band room, let’s figure out how to jam with it.",

        "title": "Ranking Fatigue is a Worldwide Phenomenon",
        "authors": "John Aubrey Douglass",
        "date": "2023-05-08",
        "articleBody": "Ranking fatigue has finally set in, and its a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nA number of high-profile law schools in the US recently announced they will no longer participate in one commercial ranking; Dutch universities have begun a move away from using rankings and citation indexes for evaluating university performance, and that of their faculty.\n\nChina, home of the Shanghai Jaio Tong global ranking of world universities, has done something similar in its recent ministerial edicts.\n\nSome universities, admittedly usually brand-name institutions with previously established international profiles, are refusing to participate in rankings – meaning they are not supplying information requested by commercial rankers, many of whom simply find a way to find basic information, like faculty to student ratios and research funding, to keep them in their ranking products.\n\nAt the same time, the COVID pandemic acted as a disruptor with the rush to on-line courses and a dissipation of the normal life of universities.\n\nIn some form the war in Ukraine and increased international tension has also brought into questions or at least a reconsideration the strategies of universities that have focused so much on improving their rankings, and therefore sense of prestige and importance.\n\nThere are two main roles for global rankings of universities, beside generating income for the rankers, that is not often deciphered by critics.\n\nFirst, and largely the case in the US and pioneered by US World News, as consumer guides for prospective students and increasingly as a source of press releases and bragging in an increasingly competitive market for talent.\n\nSecond and more significantly, as indicators for national ministries of the supposed quality and productivity of a nation’s universities and, in turn, an obsession of many universities to do better.\n\nThe first global ranking came out in 2003, generated by Shanghai Jiao Tong University at the request of the Chinese government. It and most other influential global rankings, such as the Times Higher Education and QS's commercial products, focus on a narrow band of research productivity as the primary marker of quality and notoriety.\n\nOver the last two decades, global rankings of universities emerged as a substantial force in resource allocation and shaping the behaviors of university management and faculty throughout -- if not so much in the US, in much of the world.\n\nThe good is that the ranking race, and the response of ministries, led to incentives that reshaped the internal culture of many national university systems and institutions that historically had weak internal quality and accountability policies and practices.\n\nThe bad is that it induced practices and behaviors toward a vague model of global competitiveness and a poorly designed marker of prestige that is not in the best interests of the nations they serve.\n\nMost starkly, this includes demands for faculty and graduate students intent on an academic career to publish in recognized international academic journals – feeding a startling growth in their number, citation inflation, and gaming to move up this or that ranking.\n\nFor decades many universities have focused on global rankings and its progeny the concept of World Class Universities (WCU) to drive academic planning and resource allocation – often under pressure from ministries to climb up this or that commercial ranking.\n\nIn turn, rankings companies have built profitable businesses, including consulting service on how to “improve” their research productivity shaped by their matrices. This has all been accompanied by a cavalcade of books and articles that reinforce the value of rankings and that boast of successful strategies.\n\nIn this myopic race, many of these university have lost their way, diminishing their larger mission and role in society, and hindering innovation in areas such as student learning, creative forms of research that benefit stakeholders, and the importance of their public service role.\n\nThe fact is that citations are declining as a meaningful indicator of institutional and individual research productivity.\n\nFor one, the number of journals and journal articles keeps outstripping the estimated science output, in part accelerated by the proliferation of online journals.\n\nSecond, the drive for better rankings as induced an internalized academic behavior that seeks legitimacy via a blizzard of publications and a predilection for often needless citations. One can barely read any journal article in the social sciences anymore without facing a barrage of meaningless citations often on the most mundane of observations.\n\nIn addition, impact calculations used by rankers assume that the pool of journals from which citations emerge will remain constant over time. But the pool is rapidly expanding, and with it the number of citations.\n\nThere is also gaming by universities and by researchers, and by journal editors.\n\nOne example: an article in Science notes a scandal related to Chinese scientists, most who are under great pressure to produce publications, that contract with “article mills” to produce journal quality manuscripts. “A growing black market is peddling fake research papers, fake peer reviews, and even entirely fake research results to anyone who will pay.”\n\nStudies have also shown that some journal editors, and their boards, encourage authors to cite articles in the same journal they are publishing in –in turn, driving up the journal’s impact score based, your guessed it, on citations.\n\nAlways in search of profits, we have also seen a proliferation of commercial efforts to slice and dice the market to create new rankings. Where once there was focus on data collected internationally and with some reliability, more and more rankings depend on institutions providing information.\n\nNew rankings of “social impact,” or meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, are hopelessly flawed in their methodology; many if not most universities are gaming the data. Much of these rankings rely on written responses by universities on the virtues of their programmatic efforts that, one might suspect, could lead to exaggeration and embellishment.\n\nSome universities even contract with commercial rankers to help strategies to improve their ranking, with evidence of a clear conflict of interest. Many nation-states have also got into the game, creating their own rankings when their leading national universities did not do well in the commercial global rankings.\n\nIn two books, I attempted to fight the deleterious impact of global rankings, outlining an alternative model, what I called the New Flagship University, devoted equally to teaching, research and public service. It has some, if marginal, influence in diminishing the infatuation with rankings and gaming.\n\nAt one time I also argued that the path to diminish the influence of the dominant three or so global rankings that influenced ministries, and now deeply ingrained in many university policies and behaviors, was to encourage the generation of more rankings.\n\nAnd indeed, the ranking industry continues to look for ways to monetizes the data they collect and expand their consulting services. The thought was that this would diffuse the ranking market, with universities claiming to be in the top twenty or whatever in this or that ranking, increasingly making it evident of a decline in their credibility.\n\nIt is clear today that ranking products will remain consumer guides for students, and an influence on the global movement of academic talent.\n\nBut as influencers of university strategies, policies and behaviors, they are thankfully on the decline.\n\nThat also means a corresponding decline in the notion of a World Class University that blatantly ignores the many important roles and activities universities need to pursue to be productive and impactful institutions.",

        "articleBody": "From the venue:\n\nABOUT THE SHOW\nNot that he’d wish it on anyone, but it was during his ten-year sentence in prison that Lyfe Jennings developed his honest sound, thanks to isolation and Erykah Badu. It was an arson charge that put the Toledo, Ohio native in prison. His musical aspirations started in the church choir and grew up in the Dotsons, a teenage group that Lyfe formed with his brother and a couple cousins. Prison made his music deeper, according to Lyfe, and when a copy of Erykah Badu’s Baduizm ended up in his cell in 1997, he was inspired and had the feeling that this introspective edge to his music was worth developing. \n\nTwo days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD. The day after that, he was performing live in a club. He had only a month of freedom before he was on-stage at the famous Apollo. He was booed when he walked on-stage with an acoustic guitar, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed — swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe figured he’d sold 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo “residency.” That, along with a ton of calls from promoters and record label execs on his answering machine back in Ohio, influenced Lyfe to move to New York City and pursue a major-label deal. Columbia had the right offer and released his debut, Lyfe 268-192 (his inmate number), in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of “Hypothetically,” featuring American Idol winner Fantasia added as a bonus track.",

        "articleBody": "“I was looking at him and I was like, how am I going to tell my daughter that he's gone? And that's when I just start praying,” says Olga Vedernikov. May 19th 2022. Standing in her driveway Olga heard a loud crash just moments after her son-in-law, Nikita, left her home. She ran to the scene, overwhelmed by what she saw. “I remember, I have this voice inside of me saying, 'Nikita is no longer with us.'\" She says, “I kind of took him by his neck and I start looking for a pulse and I couldn't find anything. I knew that there was no pulse, there was no life.”\n\nOlga called her church prayer chain and then 911. Time ticked by with no signs of life. She says, “I just start praying, 'I speak life, I speak life, life, come back to Nikita because I know God can do miracles. It's nothing impossible for the Lord.'”\n\nThen, after several minutes - the miraculous. She says, “He brought him back. He started breathing and I start yelling, ‘He's breathing, he's breathing.’ And they said, ‘okay, don't touch him. Don't touch him. The help is on its way.’”\n\nEMS soon began cutting Nikita from the wreckage. He suffered a host of life-threatening injuries including a fractured C1 vertebrae, collapsed lung, torn spleen and traumatic brain injury. He was taken to a hospital for emergency surgery. After several hours, his wife, Elona, who was near full term with their second child, remembers seeing him in the ICU. “It was really hard. I began bawling my eyes out and I came and I just held his hand. And at that moment, he did look very lifeless. There was, it felt like there was not much life left. He had breathing tubes and so many wires were connected to him.”\n\nPrayers were offered up around the world. Family in Russia, Ukraine, and across the U.S. were praying for Nikita’s survival and healing. “We knew that we had to lean in to Him. He was the only one that could carry us through it all. Honestly, all we could do is pray and believe that God was going to do His work in this, that He was going to bring a miracle to our lives,” says Elona. \n\nElona spent the first night wrestling with her thoughts and struggling to believe that God would heal her husband. \"Your husband is not going to live. You're not going to see him tomorrow when you wake up.\" She recalls, “'You're going to have to plan his funeral.’ And all these thoughts kept flooding my mind. And then I just hear the Lord's voice saying, ‘Your husband will not die. Do not fear. Do not fear.’ And I knew that right then and there that God’s spirit was much stronger than the enemy's voice.”\n\nDue to the extent of Nikita’s brain injury doctors said he would require more than six months in low light conditions and extensive time in rehab. However, over the next few days, Nikita began showing signs of recovery that went beyond anyone’s expectations. Elona says, “They're like, ‘We don't know how, but the swelling in his left frontal lobe actually went down.’ They were all just amazed to see how well Nikita was doing and how he was even responding already on day three. After, that really began the journey of faith and believing God for the more believing God that He was going to completely restore my husband and fully heal him.”\n\nJust under two weeks after the accident Elona gave birth to their second child. Nikita’s healing progressed so well that he was wheeled down to the delivery room to welcome his newborn son into the world. Elona says, “The nurse said, ‘Do you want to hold Ezra?’ And he nodded yes. And he just kept smiling the whole time. And he he just kept saying, ‘Ezra, Ezra, Ezra, Ezra, Ezra.’ And the whole time, he just kept repeating his name.”\n\nMiraculously, just two weeks after the accident Nikita was discharged from the hospital and spent only one week in rehab before returning home – thankful. Nikita says, “Recovery is...it's a gift from the Lord, if you can recover. My spine was cracked and I didn't get paralyzed. You know, I had a deflated lung and I'm still breathing. I had a torn spleen, and they didn't have to cut my spleen out. And so I'm thankful that He allowed me to live. I'm thankful that I can see my kids. I can hold my newborn. It's a, it's a...it's a testimony.” \n\n“Just to see how our prayers came to life and God did this for us. It was, it was the biggest blessing we could ever have walked through,” says Elona, “And that just gave us so much hope that He's our peace, He's our comforter, He's our joy, and He's the only one that will get us through this.”\n\n“God can say, you know, that's my kid and that's what I did for him. And this is, this is...this is how great I AM because I can, you know, I can raise the dead, I can bring him back to life,” says Nikita. \n\nAdding miracle upon miracle, shortly after the car crash that nearly took his life, Nikita began long distance running. In November of 2023, just a year and a half after the accident, he completed his first marathon. An expression of praise and thanks to God - who gave him back his life and health. Nikita says, “I owe it to Him, everything I have, I owe to Him. I wasn't walking and now I'm running a marathon. Tell me something, that I mean, that's it's unreal. Unreal.”\n\nElona says, “Come what may my faith will stand because it's in Jesus. And I saw how the Lord took us from the darkest season of our lives every single day. He didn't leave us, He was near to us in our weakest moment. He was still there you know, even in the darkest season of our lives. God was still faithful, He was still merciful to us.”",

        "articleBody": "On an episode of the TV program Eretz Nehederet (\"A Wonderful Country\"), Israel's version of Saturday Night Live lampooned the BBC for what some say has been one-sided coverage of the war with Hamas.\n\nAn actress playing a BBC News anchor reports that \"Israel has bombed a hospital, killing hundreds of innocent people.\" Then she demands the control room make the on-screen death toll higher. \n\nWhile funny, widespread anti-Israel news coverage in the real world is shaping opinions and government policies.\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas is raging not only within Gaza but also in newsrooms, and it's a media war many would say Hamas is winning. \n\nSome major news organizations treat Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, as equal to or worse than Hamas, an internationally designated terrorist group that massacred innocent Israelis.  \n\nAnd some have gotten into trouble by accepting as fact information put out by Hamas.\n\nGil Hoffman, the executive director of Honest Reporting, a pro-Israel media watchdog, says, \"There's never been a war where the incorrect coverage has been so obvious,  where the media has had to apologize over and over again, admit mistakes and have lost their credibility so much,  as viewers realize that they cannot depend on the media to understand what's really happening.\" \n\nAfter the Hamas atrocities committed on Oct. 7, many in the media repeatedly referred to the terrorist group as \"gunmen\" or \"militants,\" rather than terrorists. \n\nMajor news organizations were quick to report claims made by Hamas that Israel bombed the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, causing 500 civilian casualties. \n\nIt was later found the damage came from an Islamic Jihad rocket and the casualties numbered in the dozens. \n\nThe BBC has been one of the main culprits. It had to apologize for a report that Israeli forces inside Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza were \"targeting people as well as medical teams and Arabic speakers.\" \n\nThe BBC later called it a misquote. \n\nThis past summer the BBC was forced to apologize when an interviewer said to former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennet that \"Israeli forces are happy to kill children.\"\n\nThe BBC was also reportedly forced to remove several Middle East reporters from the air after they posted on social media their support for the atrocities committed on Oct. 7. \n\nDr. Tricia Miller with the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting (CAMERA), says the anti-Israel bias in some news stories meets the definition of antisemitism. \n\nMiller told CBN News, \"Israel is consistently held to a different standard, a double standard. The only way you can explain that is anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIn response to criticism of its coverage, BBC CEO Deborah Turness wrote, \"We have faced criticism and complaints that we are biased both for and against Israel, and for and against the Palestinians... And while we strive to hold true to our 100-year commitment to impartiality, we of course sometimes get it wrong... We will continue to do what we have always done: to work without fear or favor and report what we see.\"\n\nHowever, news coverage doesn't occur in a vacuum, and biased coverage against Israel has a very real effect.",

The former MTV star’s family member adopted Callie in 2009.\n\nThe mother-daughter duo have a great relationship now and they recently celebrated her 14th birthday alongside friends and family.\n\n“Happy FOURTEENTH birthday to my hilarious, sassy, silly, intelligent, sweet, picture hating, beautiful, blue-eyed girl. you’re loved by so SO many,” Ashley wrote on Instagram. \n\nAshley went on to have Phoenix Roy Lane in 2017 after suffering a miscarriage in 2014. The 32-year-old opened up about this devastating journey to  Radar Online.\n\n“It has been really hard,” Ashley told Radar at the time. “The doctor told me I was going to have a miscarriage and that there was nothing I could have done to prevent that.

Unfortunately, the two split up after having twins together, and Tilda is now dating Sandro Kopp - who she hasn't confirmed or denied she's open with.\n\nPink\n\nAlthough Pink never confirmed it, it was a popular rumor that she was in a relationship with Carey Hart. Rumor has it that Carey was more into the \"open\" than he was into the \"relationship,\" which may be why they broke up and got back together.\n\nAngelina Jolie & Brad Pitt\n\nFrom their relief efforts to their adopting of numerous children, Bragelina has made it clear they want to make a difference. And even though they're not together now, it's rumored that their relationship was open during their marriage, since Angelina Jolie has hinted that open relationships can be successful.\n\nJamie Foxx & Katie Holmes\n\nAn open relationship may actually have been the reason that Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes ended their relationship. While their relationship was heading downhill, a source meaningfully spilled to Radar Online that “Its usually one person who suggests having an open relationship.\"\n\nWill Smith & Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nUnfortunately for some who thought that Will Smith was dropping hints that he and Jada Pinkett Smith were open, Jada soon cleared up the controversy. “Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so. This does NOT mean we have an open relationship…this means we have a GROWN one,\" she spilled to Radar.\n\nMiley Cyrus & Liam Hemsworth\n\nIt's no secret that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are over, but while they were together, trying to sustain an open relationship may have been part of their troubles.\n\nWhile they were together, Miley descriped their marriage as \"unique,\" \"complex,\" and \"modern,\" in an interview with Elle, and many took that to mean that they were in an open marriage.\n\nEthan Hawk & Ryan Hawke\n\nEthan Hawke is so opposed to monogamy that he's called it \"childish\" in the past. He's in an open relationship with his wife Ryan, and seeing as their relationship began while he was still married to Uma Thurman, she's probably okay with it, too.\n\nMo’Nique & Sidney Hicks\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress and comedian has been very open about who goes on in her marriage with hubby, Sidney Hick. She told the New York Times:\n\n\"We have an agreement that we'll always be honest, and if sex happens with another person, that's not a deal breaker for us, that's not something where we'll have to say, 'Oh God, we've got to go to divorce court because you cheated on me.' Because we don't cheat.\"\n\nT-Pain & Amber Najm\n\nThe autotune singer-rapper and his wife, Amber Najm, have been married since 2003. Though he keeps his wife and marriage out of the limelight, the \"I'm Sprung\" singer has opened up about their sex life. But when he received a lot of backlash, he decided to clean up a few things. In an interview with TT Torrez, Pain said:\n\nA lot of people were saying me and my wife were swingers and that we had like a Will and Jada kinda open marriage and I was just telling them that me and my wife just sleep with other girls together. It’s not like we can just go off and have relationships with other people. People were assuming we got married for nothing. Just because we smash every now and then doesn’t mean we have an open marriage.\n\nDolly Parton & Carl Dean\n\nOne of the longest relationships in Hollywood, Dolly Parton and Carl Dean have been married for 53 years. Wowzers! Their \"let live\" attitude may have something to do with the longevity of their union. When asked if she and Carl have an open marriage, the country queen replied, \"If we cheat we don’t know it, so if we do cheat, it’s very good for both us.\" She continued telling Daily Mail, \"I don’t want to know it, if he’s cheating on me. If I’m cheating on him, he wouldn’t want to know it. And if we do, if that’s what’s making it work, then that’s fine too.\"\n\nAlan Cumming & Grant Shaffer\n\nAlan Cumming and Grant Shaffer have been married since 2007. In 2012, they remarried in celebration of their anniversary. The Good Wife actor has revealed that monogamy is not a part of their relationship. According to Heavy, he said, \"I don’t believe that monogamy is feasible.\"\n\nEmma Thompson & Greg Wise\n\nThe Love Actually actress revealed that when it comes to her 16-year marriage with British actor, Greg Wise, she doesn't believe in the traditional model of marriage. “I think that we’re locked into certain ideas and certain romantic ideals that have shaped our thinking about relationships for some time,” she said to Daily Mail. \"And I do sometimes wonder about whether there are alternatives, and about whether our fury and rage and disbelief and horror about infidelity is quite realistic.”\n\nShe ended, saying, \"All I’m suggesting is that there are other models and I’m also suggesting that we’d been a little bit caught by the happy-ever-after ideal.\"\n\nRobin Thicke & Paula Patton\n\nThough their marriage has been over since 2014, these two childhood sweethearts were together for 21 years. Throughout their years together, the couple experimented with a few outsiders. According to Star, at one point, the couple had a \"consensual three-way relationship\" with a masseuse. Things quickly went south when Robin and the masseuse allegedly left Paula out of the mix, engaging in \"a separate affair behind her back.\" \n\nAnthony Bourdain & Asia Argento\n\nWhen Anthony Bourdain died in 2018, fans took it really hard. But his girlfriend, Asia Argento, took it the hardest. Not only was she mourning the loss of her partner, but she was also the victim of a lot of daggers being thrown by fans of the beloved chef. Shortly before Bourdain took his own life, Argento was photographed holding hands with French journalist, Hugo Clement. It was that photo that urger fans to assume Argento was the reason for Bourdain's suicide. \"People say I murdered him. They say I killed him,\" she told Daily Mail TV.\n\nBut she cleared her name when she revealed interesting details about their relationship:\n\n\"He had cheated on me too. It wasn't a problem for us. He was a man who traveled 265 days a year. When we saw each other we took really great pleasure in each other's company. But we are not children. We are grown ups. Anthony was 62, I was 42. We had lives, we had wives and husbands, we had children. I cannot think of Anthony as somebody who would do an extreme gesture like this for something like that.\"\n\nNico Tortorella & Bethany Meyers\n\nNico Tortorella and Bethany Meyers have such the unconventional marriage. Aside from preferring to individually use the pronoun 'them,' and not conforming to gender norms, the couple also describes their marriage as a \"queer polyamorous relationship.\" \n\nMegan Fox & Brian Austin Green\n\nActors Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green reportedly had an open relationship before getting married. According to the New York Daily News, an unknown source said the couple worked out a deal. \"They've agreed to an open relationship where Megan can see other men but Brian can't date anyone else,\" the source said. \n\nGwyneth Paltrow & Chris Martin\n\nDuring their 10-year marriage, the actress and rocker had an open marriage. A source told Access Hollywood, \"If Chris was playing around, Gwyneth didn't care. She's never been jealous or territorial. Her philosophy is, 'We're both adults. We make our own choices.'\"\n\nTom Ford & Richard Buckley\n\nThe famed fashion designer married his journalist hubby in 2014. In an interview with New York Magazine, Ford said that monogamy isn't for them. He was quoted, saying, \"I think that monogamy is artificial. I do not think it's something that comes naturally to us.\" \n\nThomas Middleditch and Mollie Gates\n\nIn an interview with Playboy, the Silicon Valley star revealed that swinging saved his marriage to wife, Mollie Gates. He also admitted that it wasn't until they jumped the broom that he wanted an open relationship.\n\n\"I'd always thought I was a romantic and that when I fall in love, that stuff fades away,\" he said. \"It does for some years — enough to be like, 'I should get married, and I'll be different.' But it's part of me. If that's part of your being and it feels important to you, find a way to explore it, because repression sucks.\"\n\nTana Mongeau and Jake Paul\n\nThe two super popular YouTubers have always been open about their open relationship and in July, tied the knot. In an interview with ET Live, Paul said, \"Since the start of our relationship it's been, like, an open type of thing because that's just how we both are.\"",

        "articleBody": "Pulling an all-nighter feels terrible, but skimping on sleep just a bit each night may be affecting you in ways you don't realize. \n\nWe'll say it until the cows come home (or until the sheep retire under your eyelids): Sleep benefits your whole self and every element of your health. So how much can you get away with shaving off each night?\n\nProblems involving sleep quantity or quality can take a toll: Active sleep deprivation can have an acute effect on your sense of reality, and poor sleep has longer-lasting health effects like prematurely aging skin, negative mood and heart disease. When we talk about sleep deprivation, the image that may pop to mind is that of a distressed, wild-haired person who slept two hours because they were up all night with a crying baby or studying for a final. \n\nWhat's maybe talked about less pointedly is the common phenomenon of short sleep, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes as anything less than seven hours per night for adults. Importantly, your sleep doesn't have to be drastically short to have health effects. In fact, chronically restricting some sleep may less healthy, long-term, than the occasional all-nighter.\n\n\"'Short sleep' may be less extreme, but in a way it may be more problematic because people may not feel as urgently about changing this situation/behavior and end up with long term curtailed sleep,\" Jade Wu, a psychologist and sleep expert with Hatch, explained in an email.\n\nWhat is short sleep? \n\nMost adults need between seven and eight hours per night, so technically, getting less than the low end of the sleep spectrum will put you in short sleep territory. According to the CDC, somewhere between 29% and 43% of US adults reported short sleeping in 2020. \n\nIn real-life terms, this means you getting sixish hours most nights would put many people in short sleep territory. But like most things, there is some variation on what qualifies as short sleeping from person to person, Wu pointed out. \n\n\"Some people need more sleep, and some less, so 'short' is a relative term that depends on a person's sleep need at this time,\" she said. For example, sleep needs can vary by age.\nShort sleeper syndrome is a different thing\n\nShort sleeper syndrome, or SSS, is the name given to the small group of adults that can healthily function on fewer than seven or eight hours of sleep each night without \"feeling it.\" In recent years, researchers have toyed with the idea there may be genetic differences in those who can miss out on recommended sleep time without any apparent negative effects. \n\nBut for the majority of people, short sleep comes with side effects you might be missing.\n\nRead more: I Went to Bed With a Robot to Get Better Sleep. Here's Why You Should Too\n\nHealth effects of short sleeping \n\nCompared to acute sleep deprivation, where you're well aware you're in the throes of it and likely to make poor decisions or nod off early, long-term sleep deprivation or chronic short sleep may fly under your radar for a while if you're used to sleeping five to seven hours a night, for example, and occasionally catching up on the weekends.\n\nSleeping less than your body requires stresses it out, literally. Sleep deprivation affects your hormones and raises your cortisol levels, which has a negatively impact on your heart health. Insomnia, for example, has been linked to high blood pressure (often called the \"silent killer\" because it has no symptoms) and heart disease. \n\nOne study from this year looked at the effects of \"short sleep,\" about 6.2 hours per night, on women's blood sugar and insulin resistance, solidifying the potential connection between poor sleep and diabetes risk. Published in Diabetes Care, the study found that just six weeks of insufficient sleep or average short sleep interfered with insulin sensitivity, which interferes with blood sugar regulation.\n\nRead more: How I Use Sleep Deprivation as a Productivity Tool, and Why That's a Terrible Idea\n\nSigns you're short sleeping \nIf you're not sleeping enough because your work or home life priorities are putting you in a position where you feel you have to shave off a little shut-eye, chances are you already know it. But sometimes it's helpful to quantify exactly how much sleep you're getting, and you may turn to a sleep tracker, like Whoop, to detect a short sleep pattern. \n\nOther signs you're not sleeping enough include daytime drowsiness, becoming forgetful or mood effects like feeling irritable, anxious or on-edge.\n\nAnother sign your body is geared up on a short sleep pattern is that it doesn't take you long to fall asleep -- maybe under five minutes.\n\nNever too late to find a middle ground \n\nPerhaps one of the riskiest elements of short sleeping, or being mildly sleep deprived all the time, is that you may be able to keep it up for a while, potentially affecting your health gradually over time. And feeling just a little tired can affect other choices you make, like what to have for dinner and whether you have the energy to exercise, further compounding the negative effects of poor sleep.\n\nBut in the same way we emphasize improving nutrition, fitness and social health as part of a consistent lifelong goal to feel your best, there's always room for improvement and a chance to turn over a new sleep leaf. If you're not sure where to start, consider some tips for reducing your overall stress, turning to meditation and exercising during the day.   \n\n\"I think people and institutions are starting to really recognize the importance of sleep for every aspect of health and functioning,\" Wu said, adding that there's more investment in sleep as more people recognize that we're \"safer and more productive\" when well-rested. Sleep is also equalizing with other crucial elements of wellness, and was added to the American Heart Association's list of heart health essentials in 2022, she pointed out. \n\nIf you've spent the last two years short sleeping, spend the next two ahead adding a little back each night. Slowly but surely, your body will thank you.\n\n\"I think that our bodies are so good at telling us what's important,\" Wu said, \"as long as we actually listen.\"",

        "authors": "Lori Grunin",
        "date": "2023-11-06",
        "articleBody": "Apple's high-end MacBook Pro gets faster -- a lot in some respects -- and darker. \n\nThe all-too-soon followup to the Editors' Choice-earning M2 generation of the 16-inch MacBook Pro is... the Editors' Choice-earning M3 generation. The hardware is getting faster all the time; I'd be complaining vocally if I'd bought the version from earlier this year to use for rendering work, simply because the improvements in the graphics architecture generation-over-generation deliver a big performance leap for certain types of work. And it unsurprisingly remains an excellent combination of design, performance and battery life.\n\nThe MBP 16 has the same design as the previous model, which was launched in early 2023 and has been the same since 2021, so you've probably already seen it. I won't rehash my thoughts on it, since they haven't changed either; if you're curious, read my review of the early 2023 model MacBook Pro 16. What has changed is the color and the performance (duh, new chip), as well as my tools for testing the display: Those will comprise the bulk of this review. \n\nWhatever you want to call it, ultimately, the MacBook Pro is a mobile workstation. And that's the primary way to justify the price, especially for the $3,999 (£4,099, AU$6,899) configuration I tested. Apple continues to stress workstation application and gaming performance -- ray tracing and mesh shaders were a couple of the big additions to the graphics processing with the M3. But there still aren't many high-profile games available and Apple's list of upcoming games doesn't impress. As a game designer, you could make a case for it, though you'll probably still design for other platforms first.\n\nNow that there's a 15-inch MacBook Air, though, you've got a more reasonably priced option -- well, reasonably priced compared to the MacBook Pro 16 -- compared to the entry price of $2,499 for the MBP 16.\n\nThe base configuration comes with the 12-core CPU/18-core GPU version of the M3 Pro processor, with 18GB RAM and 512GB SSD. That should be fine for a lot of nonprofessional or social pro photo editing, but it's not great if you're looking for more than just a big HDR screen. If you're performing tasks that justify the outlay for the laptop, you likely need at least 1TB SSD, and would probably benefit from upping to 36GB RAM. That bumps the price to almost $3,100.\n\nGoing all-out with the configuration, with an M3 Max (16 core CPU/40 core GPU) 128GB memory and an 8TB SSD will run $7,199, which is a lot to swallow and excessive for the components, at least on paper. But yay! Apple delivered on the higher memory maximum of 128GB, which was a nitpick I had with the last model.\nOne nice thing, though, is that performance for Apple's CPUs is consistent across the lines, meaning the same chip delivers roughly comparable performance in a similarly equipped Mac Mini as it does in a MacBook Pro. On one hand, It would be nice if you got better performance on more expensive hardware, but the consistency makes buying decisions a little easier. \n\nTwo physical changes stand out. It's now available in space black instead of space gray, as well as silver, and it incorporates anodized aluminum on the cover to resist fingerprints and smudges; that's not a new idea, but it's not very common yet. It works fairly well, but it sometimes seems like it's not actually getting smudged less, but the smudges just aren't as visible from certain angles. And the keycaps still show finger oils and use printed labels, which can wear off.\n\nMy other nitpicks, like the notch at the top of the screen, which interrupts the full-width menus in applications like Photoshop, and the MagSafe power connector, which routinely disconnects for me, remain. Plus, the 170-watt brick that ships with the M3 Max model still has an adversarial relationship with my outlets; while you can use USB-C charging to avoid the MagSafe, there's no getting around that block.\n\nTo those, I'll add the webcam, which is OK but could be better. Some of that's the fault of MacOS, which provides zero control over quality and related settings. Usually, when you have no control over cameras, it's because it relies heavily on all the OS' automatic and computational processing to produce something usable. And it still lacks Face ID support.\n\n Performance\n\nThe MacBook Pro has used the same screen for a while, and there's no real reason to switch -- at least with respect to image quality. It's amazingly consistent out of the box, with no more than a 100-degree Kelvin deviation not just for any of the standard D65 color spaces, but for the gray patches across different brightness levels within them. My measurements were all in the vicinity of 6700K, but if you need a tighter D65 tolerance, you can certainly tweak the calibration. (My just-noticeable-difference threshold for color is 200K.)\n\nApple boosted the peak brightness in SDR to 600 nits from 500 nits by pumping up the power driving the panel, and I wonder if that change also affected the white point in general. \n\nIt's also color-accurate across the board; the only exceptions are the saturated Adobe RGB green and cyan, which is common for displays with a native P3 color gamut since P3 is more saturated elsewhere. (All measurements are performed using the most recent version of Portrait Display's Calman Ultimate software using a Calibrite Display Plus HL. For the Mac, we use the Patterns app as our pattern generator. Read more about our monitor testing methodology.)\n\nA lot of the performance increase I see in the M3 Max over the M2 Max is the general lift you get from increasing the core frequency, the number of cores and how they're distributed. But it also (as with everything) depends on what you're doing. No matter what you'll get a significant bump in multicore performance thanks to the individual increases in single-core speed. But, for instance, Geekbench 6 CPU tests reflect general usage, while Cinebench concentrates specifically on rendering. General-purpose GPU computation, as reflected by Geekbench's Metal test, didn't increase much, going from 38 old cores to 40 new ones. But rendering speed as measured by Cinebench more than doubled.\n\nFor a sense of practical scale within the M3 line, the MacBook Pro 14 with the base processor took just under 20 minutes to import (with lens corrections on import) and simultaneously create full-resolution previews of around 1,000 raw+JPEG photos and videos; the MacBook 16 Pro took just over 8.5 minutes. Lightroom import and thumbnail generation is CPU and memory-bound, which explains much of the difference.\n\nThe MacBook Pro 16 is generally a terrific piece of hardware, matched by an operating system that makes the most of it, at least for performance. If you need the speed, it's worth the dough.",

        "authors": "Christy Choi, Oscar Holland",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "The term “post-Covid” is a troublesome one — not least for those currently living with the disease or its long-term effects. But while experts still consider Covid-19 a pandemic, 2023 was the year the World Health Organization declared that it was no longer “a public health emergency of international concern.”\n\nMuch of the world responded to this restored sense of normalcy with a fit of revenge spending that bolstered struggling creative sectors (though the subsequent slowdown is already underway). This was largely good news for the art, fashion and culture worlds, which in a year defined by war and technological disruption responded in creative ways that both reflected and rebuked society’s most pressing challenges.\n\nHere are some of the forces that, for better or worse, captured the zeitgeist in the past 12 months:\n\nWho runs the world? Girls \n Two of the cultural economy’s biggest drivers were tours by a pair of music’s most successful women: Beyoncé and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe latter’s “The Eras Tour,” which literally made the earth shake, became the first tour to gross over $1 billion. Such was demand for tickets that organizers of the Singapore leg, for instance, reported more than 22 million people registering for the pre-sale, while more than a million people waited in an online queue. \n\n The global frenzy catapulted the 34-year-old further into mega-stardom, prompted a US Congress hearing into the lack of competition in the ticketing industry after Ticketmaster was unable to process orders and even changed the travel industry, with hotels experiencing surging demand and airlines adding extra seats around concert dates.\n\nBeyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour, meanwhile, added more than $4.5 billion to the US economy, according to an analysis of concertgoers’ spending by research firm QuestionPro. An economist at Denmark’s Danske, meanwhile, blamed the star for contributing to Sweden’s inflation woes, after her decision to kick off the 56-show extravaganza Stockholm led to a surge in hotel and restaurant prices in the city.\n‘Barbenheimer’ boosted the box office \n\n Like Bey and Tay, Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” unleashed the spending power of women, who made up an estimated two-thirds of the movie’s audience. The simultaneous release of Universal Pictures’ “Oppenheimer” meanwhile led to a major studio rivalry (or mutually beneficial publicity campaign) and a reawakening of America’s movie-going muscle.\n\nThe stark contrast between a cheeky feminist take on Barbie’s all-pink world and the harrowing story of the father of the atomic bomb inspired some of the year’s best memes, jokes and parodies, as well as the “Barbenheimer” challenge, which saw moviegoers attempt to watch the features in succession on a single day. The phenomenon turned both movies into viral sensations and created buzz that translated to more than $2.3 billion of global box office revenue, with “Barbie” becoming the highest grossing film in Warner Bros.’ 100-year history. \n\nFashion’s biggest conglomerates got bigger\n\n Conglomerates control huge swathes of the fashion industry, and they continued to tighten their grip on the $1.6-trillion luxury market this year. According to March 2023 data from Savigny Luxury Index, a general market index measuring published by the wealth management group Savigny Partners, LVMH, Kering and Richemont own a combined 62% of the luxury fashion market.\n\nThis summer, Coach and Kate Spade’s parent company Tapestry merged with Versace and Michael Kors’ owner Capri in an $8.5 billion deal. Meanwhile LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Christian Dior and Fendi, among many others, became the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value in April.\n\nAt the other end of the market, the realities of running independent high-end fashion labels felt increasingly bleak, with self-funded designers facing fierce competition and young, industry-recognized talent find themselves?unable to sustain?their brands. \n\nArt theft and restitution \n\nWith museums and collectors under ongoing pressure to return objects with questionable origins, high-profile art restitutions continued apace this year. New York’s Rubin Museum of Art and Metropolitan Museum of Art returned artifacts taken from a 11th century Nepalese monastery (pictured above) as well as from archeological sites in southeast Asia; the National Gallery of Australia and the family of the late American pipeline billionaire George Lindemann promised to send back looted objects to Cambodia; and the US announced that it will return 77 items to Yemen, to name just a few examples. \n\n One notable holdout has been the British Museum, which came under increased pressure to return contested items from its sizeable collection. Among them are the Parthenon marbles, which have for decades been at the center of a diplomatic row between the UK and Greece — and this year saw the spat intensify, leading British prime minister Rishi Sunak refusing to meet his Greek counterpart (and King Charles raising eyebrows by wearing a tie emblazoned with the Greek flag days later).\n\nThe museum was itself the victim of theft, having discovered in August that around 2,000 pieces from its collection were missing (and in some cases, had been offered for sale on eBay). Recovery efforts are currently underway, with the museum appealing to the public for the return of its treasures. \n\nMoney talks, ‘quiet luxury’ whispers\n\n With many parts of the world facing a cost-of-living crisis caused by rising inflation and soaring energy and food prices, it is perhaps no surprise that 2023 was the year of “quiet luxury.” The idea that affluence should whisper, not shout, was reflected in a new kind of pared-back simplicity — on the runways and beyond — that communicated status without the need for blaring logos or in-your-face styling.\n\nHBO’s “Succession,” which concluded its fourth and final season in May, helped bring the “stealth wealth” trend to the fore, with the show’s ultra-rich protagonists often opting for elevated basics (Shiv Roy’s work wear and Kendall Roy’s baseball caps were among the show’s many sartorial talking points). So, too, did Gwyneth Paltrow’s high-profile but low-fuss courtroom wardrobe, which arguably generated more headlines than the ski accident being litigated at the trial. \n\nSoon, Prada was pitching its new menswear collection as “a reconsideration of simple things” and cult designer Phoebe Philo was launching her long-awaited eponymous label with a debut collection defined by understated elegance. Elsewhere, the trend — not to be confused with minimalism — spanned watches, accessories and even hotels (see jeweler Chopard’s new “anti-hotel” in the heart of Paris).\n\nStrikes paralyzed Hollywood — and the red carpet \n\n For almost four months this year, Hollywood went on strike as actors called for increased pay and residuals, which have diminished in the age of streaming services that eschew conventional royalties and rarely disclose how often content is watched. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that actors earned an average of $27.73 an hour last year and noted that many aren’t paid year-round. Writers also went on strike, bringing movie and television productions to a halt.\n\nAward ceremonies were scaled back or postponed, resulting in some unusually low-key red carpets. And while this was bad news for celebrity makeup artists and stylists, who lost a major source of income, it also presented influencers and models a chance to step into the limelight vacated by movie stars. \n\nIn November, the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA finally reached a settlement with major studios. The agreement, which will expire in May 2026, include pay increases, longer-duration employment, better benefits, royalty guarantees and protection against the studios’ use of artificial intelligence — another major sticking point for both actors and writers.\n\nAI continued to vex creatives\n\nScreenwriters and actors weren’t the only ones worried about AI putting their livelihoods at risk. Authors like George R. R. Martin, Jodi Picoult and John Grisham joined a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, saying it used copyrighted work while training its systems to create more human-like responses. More than 10,000 authors, including James Patterson, Roxane Gay and Margaret Atwood, also signed an open letter calling on AI industry leaders to obtain consent from authors when using their work to train large language models — and to compensate them fairly when they do.\n\n Visual artists meanwhile found ways to fight back against their work being used by AI without their consent — thanks in part to programs like Glaze, which tricks AI models into reading images differently to the human eye (for example, an oil painting might look like a charcoal drawing) and PhotoGuard, which stops them from manipulating images.\n\nOther fields also faced competition from emerging technology — in April, an AI-generated image even won a Sony World Photography Award. But many creatives embraced the developments’ potential, from Japan’s first AI-generated manga comic to entire fashion collections designed with the technology.\n\nNFTs hit new lows\n\n If the dramatic rise and fall of NFT prices was among the biggest stories of 2022, this year offered more sobering long-term realities for token enthusiasts. And with trading volumes flatlining, some of the firms and figures behind the celebrity-endorsed collectibles faced a new wave of legal action.\n\nIn April, investors sued the creators of Bored Ape NFTs, Yuga Labs, among others, for “misleadingly” promoting the tokens and artificially inflating their prices. (At the time, the company told CNN the claims were “completely without merit or factual basis.”) Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo is also facing a $1-billion class action lawsuit for his promotion of the crypto exchange Binance, including selling NFTs of himself. Elsewhere, a federal jury in New York found that an artist’s NFT versions of Hermes’ famous Birkin bags violated the luxury house’s trademark rights.\n\nWith Bitcoin prices rallying in recent months, however, some crypto analysts have expressed hope that the “NFT winter” may finally be coming to an end. But despite a relatively healthy bump in November sales, it’s a long, long way back — even to more recent heights.\n\nTiaras, trans rights and turmoil at Miss Universe \n\n Regardless of what place — if any — you think the Miss Universe competition has in the modern age, this year’s pageant generated more talking points than any in recent memory. In a victory for LGBTQ inclusion, the competition featured two trans women for first time, after Marina Machete and Rikkie Kollé were selected to represent Portugal and Netherlands, respectively.\n\nTriumph turned to turmoil just days before the finale in El Salvador, when the owner of Miss Universe, JKN Global Group, filed for bankruptcy. But while the Thai media distribution company was nonetheless able to stage a successful show — complete with elegant evening gowns and some delightfully bizarre “national costumes” — what followed was even more dramatic.\n\nAfter Nicaragua’s Sheynnis Palacios became country’s first representative to claim the tiara, the director of the Miss Nicaragua franchise, Karen Celebertti, was charged with conspiracy and treason. Celebertti, who alongside her husband and son stands accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow the government, subsequently resigned. (Celebertti did not respond to CNN’s request for comment but wrote on Instagram that she has worked transparently and “with zeal and effort to exalt the name of my homeland.”) \n\nChoppy waters for auction houses\n\n There have been some big-ticket items up for grabs at this year’s auctions, though only two hit the hallowed nine-figure mark: A Picasso masterpiece entitled “Femme à la montre,” which fetched more than $139 million to become the second most valuable work by the Spanish artist ever go under the hammer, and Gustav Klimt’s last ever portrait, which became the most expensive artwork ever to sell at a European auction when it fetched the equivalent of $108 million in London.\n\nBroadly, however, sales were sluggish. Christie’s, for instance, reported a $2.2 billion year-on-year drop in sales 2023, while Philips saw a decline of almost 40% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. \n\n The auction giants have looked to diversify their offerings, with several major sales of sneakers and sports memorabilia taking place in 2023. But their success is underpinned by blue-chip art sales, which a recent analysis by Artsy suggests have fallen dramatically: This year, the top 100 auction lots sold for a total $2.4 billion, compared to $4.1 billion in 2022.\n\nLike museums, auction houses also faced scrutiny over the origins of items passing through their doors. In September, Christie’s canceled a sale of jewelry owned by late billionaire Heidi Horten after Jewish advocacy groups and human rights organizations raised concerns that her husband had amassed their family fortune by acquiring Jewish businesses that were sold under duress in Nazi Germany. \n\nSurprise discoveries\n\n One person’s trash is another one’s treasure, and 2023 saw several lucky bargain shoppers finding gems and turning a handsome profit. Britain’s thrift stores proved particularly lucrative, with a couple in the UK buying a tiny vase by a Japanese ceramic artist for the equivalent of $3.30 that was later valued at almost $12,000, while an anonymous collector sold two Qing dynasty jars for over $74,000, having bought them bought them in a batch of ceramics for just $25.\n\nIn the US, an antiques enthusiast saw her $4 purchase attract a sale price of $191,000 at auction after it was revealed to be a long-lost N.C. Wyeth painting (the New York Times subsequently reported that the sale at one point fell through, before a buyer acquired it for an undisclosed six-figure sum). Then, earlier this month, a thrift shopper in Richmond, Virginia turned a huge profit when the glass vase she purchased for $3.99 at Goodwill sold for over $107,000 after being identified as the work of Italian architect Carlo Scarpa.\n\nOther art world discoveries came by way of corrected attributions — such as a painting once sold at auction for $15,000 that fetched almost $14 million this month after being identified as a Rembrandt. And there were surprise returns, too, including a stolen Van Gogh painting that was delivered to a Dutch art sleuth in an IKEA bag.",

        "articleBody": "Hong Kong CNN  — Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.\n\nTwo regulatory filings from last Thursday revealed that Ma had been looking to offload 10 million shares, worth nearly $871 million.\n\nBut because the company’s stock price has fallen below the billionaire’s expectations, he has not sold “a single share,” according to a Wednesday post from Alibaba (BABA) Chief People Officer Jane Jiang Fang on the company’s internal forum seen by CNN.\nThe sales were initially planned to take place this Tuesday through JC Properties and JSP Investment, two entities linked to Ma and his philanthropic foundation, according to the filings. \n\n The disclosure of the intended sales came the same day Alibaba reported third quarter earnings, when it announced that it would drop plans to spin off its cloud computing arm partly due to uncertainties caused by US controls on chip exports to China.\n\nAlibaba’s stock plunged 9% in New York on Thursday and nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping out about $20 billion from the company’s market value.\n\nSo far this year, Alibaba’s shares have fallen more than 10%.\n\nJiang said the fact that both pieces of news came at the same time was just a “coincidence.”\n\nThe news of the sale had triggered rumors that Ma had lost confidence in the company, but Jiang urged employees to dismiss such speculation. The executive said the transactions were part of a long-term plan laid out in August, which would allow Ma’s office to invest in agricultural technology and welfare projects both in and outside China.\n\nMa believes that the Hangzhou-based firm’s stock “is currently significantly lower than Alibaba’s actual value, and he will not sell it,” she said.\n\nAlibaba Chairman Joe Tsai also weighed in, writing in a comment on the same post seen by CNN that he had “full confidence” in the company. \n\n On Friday, Ma’s office told the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper owned by Alibaba, that he remained “very positive” about the company’s prospects, despite plans for “a partial sell-down.”\n\nMa’s foundation and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter, or whether the share sale would proceed if the company’s stock price rebounded.\n\nThe group is currently in the midst of a major restructuring, which was announced in March and originally intended to result in a split of six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors.\n\nBut last week, Alibaba said it would rethink plans not just for its cloud business, but for a listing of its grocery chain Freshippo, citing a need to “evaluate market conditions.”\n\nMa founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.",

        "title": "Ecologists Strive to Revive Struggling Moth Species",
        "authors": "Rina Diane Caballar",
        "date": "2023-11-17",
        "articleBody": "Robert Hoare first spotted the elusive Izatha psychra, an endangered moth in New Zealand, on a warm night in 2005. At the center of the country’s South Island, amid the fenced flats and sloping hills of the Pukaki Scientific Reserve, the entomologist erected a generator-powered light trap. Then, an hour before midnight — just as the generator’s fuel threatened to peter out and plunge everything into darkness — he glimpsed fluttering wings and a flash of gray.\n\nHoare is one of only a handful of people who can claim to have encountered the moth, as fewer than a dozen have ever been seen. All of these sightings occurred either in the dry shrublands and scrub of the Mackenzie District that encompasses the 79-acre reserve, or in the neighboring district of Central Otago roughly 140 miles south.\n\nHowever, the quest for I. psychra now covers a much smaller expanse. In August 2020, a fire that began near the turquoise waters of Lake Pukaki to the east raged across more than 7,600 acres of forest and scrub — including most of the Pukaki Scientific Reserve, damaging its threatened and declining vegetation. “The reserve was made naked by the fire,” says Eric Edwards, a science advisor at New Zealand’s Department of Conservation. “Before the fire, you wouldn’t notice much of the rock because the shrubs were fully leafed. Then the fire came through and burned the small twigs and leaves away.”\n\nI. psychra’s sparse population depends on the reserve’s old-growth shrubland for food and shelter. And despite their limited numbers, the moths play a vital role within the ecosystem. The genus is known to feed on deadwood, dead leaves, leaf litter or lichens, according to Hoare. Though there is no real nutrition in this detritus, the moths digest largely fungal content and release nutrients from that back into the ecosystem.\n\nWhen the blaze destroyed most of this habitat, it immediately shrunk the chances of survival for the already struggling species.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nI. psychra’s discovery dates to the late-19th century, when the naturalist John Davies Enys collected the first known specimen, now residing in London’s Natural History Museum. He encountered it near Porters Pass, in the mountains some 186 miles northeast of the Pukaki Scientific Reserve. Since then, sightings have been extremely rare, and researchers have yet to produce even a rough estimate of the moth’s overall numbers. Hoare, currently a senior researcher at New Zealand’s Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research, has seen three, all males. “Because the female moth has never been seen, we guess that it doesn’t fly very much,” he says.\n\nAdding to this sense of mystery is the moth’s tiny size and nondescript appearance. Only around a third of an inch long and three-quarters of an inch wide with outstretched wings, I. psychra’s pale-gray color allows it to blend in with the surrounding scrub. Hoare, however, believes its enigmatic nature has more to do with the reduction in its habitat. Those strongholds are facing the threat of destruction from weed invasion and a warmer, drier climate that increases the risk of wildfires — such as the 2020 Lake Pukaki fire.\n\nFive months after that event, a team of ecologists including Edwards surveyed the reserve to search for the I. psychra moths. They turned up a tiny, 1-acre pocket of dense shrubland that proved impenetrable to the blaze; underneath these thick shrubs was a small gully with undamaged deadwood, leaf litter and lichens in it. The oasis was a likely site for moth survivors.\n\nOn a dry, windless day, the team returned to the remnant of unburnt land and set up a trap using light. “It’s like going for a picnic,” Edwards explains. The team spread a white sheet on the ground, placed a light source in the center, then waited for the guests to arrive. “The moths will settle around the light, and you can look at them and think about what species they might be,” he says.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, half a dozen or so were drawn to the light at a time, an amalgamation of species that landed and settled before taking to the skies again. Then, Edwards saw something resembling I. psychra — a glimmer of hope for the species. The Izatha genus are known as lichen tuft moths. That’s because most of them have little scale tufts on their wings, which are slightly curved or curled. “It helps them look a bit more like rough bark or lichen,” Hoare says. “[But] Izatha psychra hardly has these. They’re small and inconspicuous scale tufts.”\n\nEdwards, still uncertain of what he had witnessed, took photos of two male moths and sent them to Hoare, who then examined their features. From their pale-gray color and scale tufts to their wing markings — the little black streak at the base and the eye-shaped mark in the middle — Hoare was elated to find that the moths perfectly matched the I. psychra species. “Anytime you have something that’s rediscovered or saved, that’s a good story,” he says.\n\nPieces of the puzzle\n\nThe future of the species is ultimately tied to the region’s recovery — still in its early stages. “There’s a lot of still just blackened, burned sticks and stumps, but some plants are starting to regenerate,” says Dean Nelson, a senior ranger of biodiversity at the Department of Conservation who oversees the reserve. Indeed, signs of new life abound: Sprouts spring up from the bottom of shrubs and tufts of tussock grass bounce back in open areas.\n\nProtecting the land from invasive weeds and mammalian pests is another important piece of the puzzle. Immediately after the fire, Nelson and his team rebuilt the damaged fence, with a double barbed wire on top. The hope is that this will be enough to keep rabbits, pigs and wallabies out, all of which chew on the reserve’s plant life and slow vegetation recovery.\n\nEfforts are also underway to clear out the surrounding invasive pines, which cover nearly 4.5 million acres of New Zealand. “Wilding pines were part of the problem for the fire because they burn very hot and exacerbate [it],” Nelson says. “Fire in grassland can burn quickly, but it’s generally a lot less intense than fire that originates in pine forest.”\n\nNelson estimates it could take as many as 50 years for the reserve to recover. But hope continues to burn bright for I. psychra, with two more sightings of the species in late 2022 — this time at the dry, shrubby lands of Mount Buster, some 112 miles south of the Pukaki Scientific Reserve.\n\n“As scarce and hard to find as it is, it has brought a fresh new look at the landscape by those who care,” Edwards says of the species. This shift in perspective is what Maori, the Indigenous people of New Zealand, call kaitiakitanga, or guardianship and protection of the environment. It stems from the Maori worldview acknowledging the intricate ties between humans and the natural realm.\n\n“It is invoking a form of stewardship that communities of people in New Zealand are now tuning in to,” Edwards says. And when it comes to I. psychra, saving the moth’s habitat could help bring the species back from the brink.",

        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "The southern Reykjanes Peninsula has been rattled by earthquakes for weeks with authorities saying that chances of an eruption were high.\n\nFor over a month, the town of Grindavík on the Reykjanes Peninsula has been waiting and watching. Although most of the ~3,000 people have been evacuated from the area, authorities in Iceland have monitored the area, measuring thousands of earthquakes, a multitude of cracks in the ground and the release of volcanic gases from these cracks. No one knew if, when and where an eruption might occur.\n\nThe waiting is finally over. In the evening of December 18, an almost 2.5 mile (4 kilometer) fissure starting erupting northeast of Grindavík and since then has been producing lava fountains and lava flows.\n\nThe eruption began at 10:17 pm local time according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. At earthquake swarm had begun in the area near Sundhnúkagígar at around 9 pm local time and it was only a little over an hour later that lava finally reached the surface. Luckily, the eruption so far has not been in main part of Grindavík, the Blue Lagoon or the geothermal power plant nearby. \n\nThere are some spectacular shots of the eruption that have been taken by local authorities showing the fissure and lava flows. There are also webcams pointed towards the eruption, so you can watch it all happening at home.\n\nI've annotated a few webcam captures from this evening to give you an idea of what's happening. Now, the hardest thing is scale in these images as there are no obvious landmarks to see in the dark. My best guess is that the lava flows are tens of meters tall (maybe hundred feet or more) but that is a guess based on prior activity. So far, the size of the fissure has outpaced those formed during the earlier eruptions on the peninsula since 2020, including the Fagradalsfjall eruption that ended in later summer 2023.\n\nThe IMO is already reporting that the eruption is decreasing in intensity -- which, as they point out, doesn't mean it is going to end soon, just that it has reached some equilibrium. Eruptions such as these might last days to months, but anyone saying they know how long it will be is guessing at best. This eruption isn't likely to create any sort of aviation havoc like Eyjafjallajökull did in 2010 except possibly for flights in and out of Reykjavik.\n\nAt the moment, the eruption is the best we might have hoped for: an impressive sight that isn't posing direct danger to life and property. We'll see if it stays that way.",

        "authors": "Alden Gonzalez, Jeff Passan",
        "date": "2023-12-15",
        "articleBody": "LOS ANGELES -- For six years, the video remained a secret, squirreled away for the next time. In 2017, during their failed courtship of Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers held onto the minute-or-so-long clip as part of their closing pitch, one they never got to give. Two weeks ago, the next time arrived, and the Dodgers weren't leaving anything to chance.\n\nFor more than a decade they had chased Ohtani, flattered him, pined for him, only to be denied. In 2012, they wanted him to be the first elite Japanese high schooler to skip Nippon Professional Baseball and sign with an MLB organization. At the last minute, he declined. Five years later, a 23-year-old, Ohtani arrived in the major leagues with the temerity to think he could hit and pitch and do both full time. As much as the Dodgers tried to build their team around him -- he could play the outfield and pitch every sixth day -- the National League did not have a full-time designated hitter. Ohtani believed DHing was a necessity for his body to withstand the rigors of what he was going to attempt. No matter how compelling the Dodgers' presentation, how ideal the fit, it wouldn't happen. He signed with the Los Angeles Angels, just 30 miles down the road. He didn't play a single postseason game in his six years there.\n\nThis time was different. Every team has a DH. And the Dodgers offered so much more, from the 10 division titles in 11 seasons, to the farm system that churned out major leaguers on the regular, to the robust analytical group that dispenses wisdom to players. Plus, of course, the video -- which, in the grand scheme, wasn't a whole lot, taking up a fraction of the three hours Ohtani spent with the team's upper management at Dodger Stadium on Dec. 1. But in that sliver of time, on the screen for Ohtani was a figure long associated with Los Angeles sports excellence making the case for him to sign with the Dodgers.\n\nKobe Bryant.\n\nBack in 2017, Bryant had filmed the clip as a favor to the team. Now, more than three years after his death in a helicopter crash, Bryant's reputation as the ultimate competitor spans all sports, and his message to Ohtani registered the same posthumously in 2023 as it would have then: There's no better place in the world to win than Los Angeles, and there's no better team in baseball to win with than the Dodgers.\n\n\"That was one of the highlights of the whole meeting,\" Ohtani told ESPN through his interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara. \"I was really surprised to see it. It was a strong and touching message.\"\n\nWhen Bryant said Ohtani's name, it took him aback. They never met, but Ohtani marveled at Bryant's commitment, to his craft, to his sport, to his team. Mizuhara, who is as much adviser to Ohtani as the conduit for his words, grew up in Los Angeles and understood what it meant for Bryant to vouch for the Dodgers. A minute of his time, of the presence he still casts, felt like a wonderful eternity.\n\nThis was the Dodgers' best pitch -- the equivalent of Ohtani's sweeper to Mike Trout that ended the World Baseball Classic -- and it suggested that even if 2012 and 2017 weren't the time for Ohtani and the Dodgers, now was. Now was when he could build a legacy beyond the two American League Most Valuable Player awards and his reputation as the most talented player ever into something even better: championship rings.\n\nWhat came after the Dodgers' presentation -- the speculation, the false reports, the flight tracking, the $700 million contract and the details that made it even more compelling -- were all part of a six-week-long free agent journey that actually began more than a decade earlier, in Mizusawa, Japan, when a teenaged Ohtani charted the course for his baseball life.\n\nThe beginning of the final stage -- the one in which the fullness of Ohtani's legend will reveal itself -- came Thursday when he stepped onstage at Dodger Stadium in front of nearly 300 media members and was introduced with a No. 17 jersey. Minutes later, the Dodgers proved they weren't willing to let a single moment of his tenure there go to waste, not like in Anaheim: News broke that they had a trade in place for Tyler Glasnow, a potential ace to fill the top of their patchwork rotation, as they wait for Ohtani to rehab the elbow injury that led to his second surgery this fall.\n\nNot much of this went according to plan, or to the Dodgers' usual way of doing business. But if any player can turn baseball convention on its head, it's Shohei Ohtani.\n\nANDREW FRIEDMAN'S NINE-YEAR reign atop the Dodgers' baseball operations department has featured a notable, and at times limiting, degree of pragmatism. Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Trevor Bauer -- the latter of whom signed for only three years and was ultimately suspended 194 games under the league's domestic violence policy -- were the only players given nine-figure contracts under his watch. The Dodgers' resources are vast, but Friedman rarely splurges in free agency.\n\nOhtani presented an entirely different calculus. For the Dodgers, he was more than a player. Ohtani was an icon, a brand, an economy unto himself -- a conduit to an entire country that reveres him, an adopted country increasingly smitten by him and a world that would associate him with their logo and colors. And beyond all of that -- the money he could bring, the championships he could win -- would be the selfish pleasure of getting to watch the most talented player in baseball history up close every day. So of course they need to go after him, Friedman told the Dodgers' front office during meetings in October, in the aftermath of a crushing NL Division Series sweep at the hands of an underdog Arizona Diamondbacks team. There was no bad structure on a potential contract, no limit on what they would consider. As long as it fell within the bounds of the rules, Friedman said, \"the answer is yes.\"\n\nThe Dodgers' admiration for Ohtani dates more than a decade, years before Friedman ran their front office. Ohtani was a wiry, 6-foot-4 teenager who threw 99 mph and sent baseballs over fences with stunning regularity. The industry saw him as a bona fide pitching prodigy whose bat would be overwhelmed by better pitching, but Ned Colletti, the Dodgers' general manager from 2005 to 2014, remembers his scouts raving about Ohtani's offensive potential.\n\nIf not for the Nippon-Ham Fighters' insistence on giving Ohtani every opportunity to attempt a two-way role, many in Japan believe he would have been a Dodger in 2012. If not for the lack of a universal DH, many in the organization believe he would have been a Dodger in 2017.\n\nTo make him a Dodger in 2023, the groundwork needed to be laid a year prior.\n\nThe Dodgers were coming off a disappointing, early October exit at the hands of the division-rival San Diego Padres in fall 2022 and faced a glaring hole at shortstop. A historic class presented itself at the position, highlighted by Trea Turner, Xander Bogaerts, Carlos Correa and Dansby Swanson. The Dodgers basically ignored it, opting to solve the position internally by shifting young infielder Gavin Lux.\n\nThey non-tendered Cody Bellinger, their 27-year-old 2019 MVP, and went frugal in free agency, never so much as engaging with Aaron Judge on the heels of his 62 home run season. Seven major league players were signed: Clayton Kershaw, J.D. Martinez, Noah Syndergaard, David Peralta, Jimmy Nelson, Shelby Miller and Alex Reyes. None received more than one guaranteed year. In total, they spent $53.3 million. And while they failed in their desire to dip back under the luxury tax threshold to reset the accompanying penalties, the Dodgers remained nimble for the future, with only Freeman and Betts under contract beyond 2025.\n\nThough the Dodgers never said it themselves, executives and agents throughout the sport -- and fans trying to speak dreams into existence -- all began to believe the same thing: The Dodgers, owned by Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter and fellow billionaire partners, were clearing room to offer Ohtani the largest deal in baseball history.\n\n\"In my career, there was never a stronger interest by a franchise I worked with with a particular player than there was with him,\" said Colletti, who now serves as an analyst for the Dodgers' television network. \"I was in the game 40 years, so it goes back quite a while. We were always involved in Latin America, we were always involved in Asia, and as you think about the players, the international signs, I can't recall any player -- any player -- that had our attention as much as he did.\"\n\nTHE DODGERS MET with Ohtani on the first afternoon of December, canceling stadium tours and closing their team store to do so in secrecy. They took the opportunity to highlight their organization's synergy: the marriage of their scouting and analytics departments, how information flows through to their coaches and their trainers, how communication keeps the entire organization in lockstep, immune from the turnover that confronts them every offseason.\n\nOhtani responded well, but the Dodgers ended the afternoon unsure how they'd line up among the other contenders. Ohtani met Giants officials at their ballpark the following day and reportedly traveled to visit the Blue Jays' spring training facility in Dunedin, Florida, two days later. His inclinations were unknown.\n\n\"He has a very good poker face,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said during his media session at last week's winter meetings. \"I think he was smiling inside.\"\n\nSo much about Ohtani's proclivities remain a mystery to the general public and, to some extent, even those who shared a clubhouse with him. But his desire to perform at his sport's grandest stage and accumulate championships has long been obvious to those around him. One longtime Angels staffer described it as \"almost Kobe-like.\" Ohtani won the Japan Series with the Fighters in 2016 and has longed to replicate that in the World Series, a yearning that only grew with every disappointing season in Orange County.\n\nOhtani's performance during Japan's title-winning march through the WBC -- the uplifting pregame speech; the clinching strikeout; the raw, uncharacteristic displays of emotion throughout -- served as the ultimate validation for those who watched him closely in recent years.\n\nThe question of how that desire would impact his free agency was answered by the structure of his potential contract. The Dodgers proposed multiple iterations of deals working up toward where they believed Ohtani's would wind up: somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 million guaranteed, nearly $175 million larger than Trout's deal with the Angels. As the total guarantee increased, the Dodgers proposed different structures that would allow them payroll flexibility, including the possibility of deferred money, like in Betts' and Freeman's deals.\n\nOne week ago, after meetings with prospective teams had concluded, Ohtani and his CAA agent, Nez Balelo, returned to Friedman with a contract structure unlike any ever seen in professional sports: 10 years, $700 million -- but with $680 million deferred, interest-free, in the 10 years that follow the expiration of the deal, taking the competitive balance tax (CBT) hit from $70 million a year to just $46 million.\n\n\"I wouldn't have had the guts to propose it,\" Friedman said.\n\nSaid Ohtani, through his interpreter: \"I was looking into it, did some calculations, and I figured if I can defer as much money as I can, if that's going to help the CBT, it's going to help the Dodgers to be able to sign other players and make a better team. I felt like that was worth it.\"\n\nThe structure triggered a quick approval from the Dodgers. Unbeknownst to them, Balelo then proposed the same deal to at least three other teams. The San Francisco Giants and Toronto Blue Jays agreed to the terms. The Angels, Ohtani's original major league team, were also given a chance, but sources said they ultimately declined.\n\nThe Dodgers, meanwhile, came away from their Friday morning conversation believing they were in good standing. Then, about 30 minutes later, social media left them wondering whether their third time pursuing Ohtani wasn't the charm after all.\n\nIT BEGAN LATE Thursday night, when an X account found a private jet that was scheduled to fly from Orange County to Toronto on Friday, prompting thoughts that Ohtani might be on it. A few minutes before 11 a.m. PT, a popular Dodgers fan site posted a report stating that Ohtani \"is signing with the Toronto Blue Jays.\" It was the most dramatic twist in what had been a monthlong emotional roller coaster for Friedman and his front-office lieutenants.\n\n\"You know those crazy games where there's late lead changes, and they graph it like that?\" Friedman said after Ohtani's news conference. \"I think that's a little bit of my range of emotions. There's times when I felt more confident, there's times when I was down extremely low. It definitely took some time off my life.\"\n\nWhile speculation ran rampant, Ohtani sat at his Southern California home playing with his puppy, which had become famous during a recent appearance on MLB Network. (His name, Ohtani revealed Thursday, is Decoy, short for the Japanese word dekopin, which means a finger-flick to the forehead.) A follow-up report stating that Ohtani was indeed aboard a Toronto-bound flight was eventually debunked -- but not before it caused a frenzy on social media, with fans following flight tracker sites for minute-by-minute updates. The world learned the passenger's true identity around 6 p.m. ET, when a photographer for the Canadian Broadcast Corp. dispatched to the tarmac at Pearson Airport in Toronto captured none other than businessman and \"Shark Tank\" panelist Robert Herjavec.\n\nAt that point, Ohtani still hadn't made his decision. Late Friday, he finally did.\n\n\"There's not really one reason,\" Ohtani said Thursday. \"There's a lot of reasons. I met with a few teams throughout the negotiation process. Honestly, every team I met with and had a chance to talk to, they were all great. It was really, really a tough decision for me. But at the end of the day, I had to choose one team. And the Dodgers were my pick.\"\n\nFriedman learned of the decision around 12 p.m. PT on Saturday while attending his son's soccer game and hosting a Zoom call with a free agent he was trying to recruit. The call from Balelo came near the tail end of it, and Friedman abruptly jumped off.\n\nHe was told Ohtani had chosen the Dodgers and that it would soon be announced through social media.\n\nNo more than five minutes later, the Dodgers' logo graced Ohtani's Instagram page.\n\nIn the end, despite speculation to the contrary, location \"did not come into play,\" Balelo said Thursday. Getting to $700 million, a number no athlete had ever reached within the confines of his or her sport, \"was not a goal.\"\n\nIf there was one key driver in Ohtani's decision, it was winning.\n\n\"I want to win championships,\" Ohtani said. \"When people look back at the championships I won, I want people to think that I was a core member and I was a big part of that championship-winning team.\"\n\nTEN MONTHS AGO, Andrew Friedman traveled halfway around the world to watch Samurai Japan, the national team captained by Ohtani, train for the WBC. Tens of thousands of fans showed up in Miyazaki wearing a panoply of different hats -- Yankees and Padres and Mariners and Red Sox and Rangers and Dodgers. In Friedman's head, he envisioned something different: a sea of blue, all interlocking Ls and As, the natural conclusion to the trailblazing in Japan the Dodgers started 30 years ago with Hideo Nomo.\n\n\"One of our goals is to have baseball fans in Japan convert to Dodger Blue,\" Friedman said as part of his opening remarks at Ohtani's introductory news conference. \"And to have Shohei, along with the rest of his teammates, help grow the game and passion for Dodgers baseball all across Japan.\"\n\nWhen his elbow heals and he's back to hitting and pitching, the full power of Ohtani once again will reveal itself. But his aura is so immense, his pull practically gravitational, that even in the meantime, him just being a Dodger goes far. In the same way that the Los Angeles front office dreamed of watching him on a daily basis, players see being his teammate as a selling point. In perhaps his first official duty as a Dodger, Ohtani joined Freeman, starting pitcher Bobby Miller and catcher Will Smith in a recruiting meeting with Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Ohtani's Samurai Japan teammate and the second-best free agent in this year's class.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Ohtani's official introduction as a Dodger, the team reaped the benefits of some of the financial flexibility his deal allowed. On Friday morning, the Dodgers finalized a five-year, $135 million contract extension with Glasnow, the 6-8 right-hander whom they're acquiring from Tampa Bay. Suddenly a starting rotation with question marks looks plenty better, and a trade that in recent weeks had been bandied about finds itself pushed across the finish line.\n\nOn Thursday, Ohtani spoke of his contract through the lens of winning, happily forgoing cash now -- his $40 million-plus per year in off-field revenue more than covers what he's giving up in deferred money -- so the Dodgers can build a superteam around him. It's not just the quarter-billion dollars of net present value Ohtani gave up with the deferrals; it's how long the Dodgers can take to pay for them. Los Angeles doesn't need to fund deferred compensation until July 1, 2026, a point at which the organization expects to have made so much money off of Ohtani's presence that the deal essentially pays for itself.\n\nAll of that, to Ohtani, is perfectly acceptable. He gets richer. The team gets richer. As long as the Dodgers remain the Dodgers -- a fact he made clear in a key-man clause that allows him to opt out of the contract if Walter sells the team or Friedman is no longer president of baseball operations -- then they will provide him everything he didn't have in Anaheim, everything he wanted back in 2012 and 2017, everything he finally gets in 2023 and beyond.\n\n\"When they look back at the last 10 years, even though they made the playoffs every single year, won only one World Series ring, they considered it a failure,\" Ohtani said. \"And when I heard that, I knew that they were all about winning. And that's exactly how I feel.\"",

        "articleBody": "Five of ESPN's top 10 heavyweights -- three of them former champions -- compete Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on one of the most stacked cards in years (ESPN+ PPV, 11 a.m. ET).\n\nAnthony Joshua meets Otto Wallin in the main event while Deontay Wilder faces Joseph Parker in the co-feature. If both Joshua and Wilder win -- no foregone conclusion -- they have a deal in place to finally meet on March 9 in Riyadh, sources told ESPN.\n\nAlso on the undercard: ESPN's No. 1 light heavyweight, Dmitry Bivol, and No. 1 cruiserweight, Jai Opetaia.\n\nNo. 8 heavyweight Filip Hrgovic will compete as well on Saturday. There are also talented heavyweight boxers on this eight-fight card that sit just outside ESPN's rankings, like Frank Sanchez, Arslanbek Makhmudov and Daniel Dubois, who meets Jarrell \"Big Baby\" Miller.\n\nThe following week, Naoya \"The Monster\" Inoue attempts to become an undisputed champion in a second weight class in 12 months with a fight against Marlon Tapales on Tuesday in Tokyo (ESPN+, 3 a.m. ET).\n\nBut where do they all rank among the top 100 boxers in the world?\n\nThe age-old pound-for-pound debate rages on year after year. Just who is the baddest man on the planet?\n\nFighters jockey for position in their respective weight classes, but they're also measured against each other time and again. Those who can rack up titles in multiple weight classes sometimes are pushed ahead of others during these water-cooler arguments across the world, and really, it's impossible to have a consensus No. 1 no matter who's competing at the time.\n\nThis is all subjective. After all, most of the fighters on this list will never face each other, sometimes even when they're competing in the same weight class. That's the reality of today's fractured boxing landscape.\n\nBut we can still try to determine who deserves to stand above the rest across global boxing, taking into account accomplishments, current form, talent level, potential, and most of all, the vaunted eye test. Some fighters just look the part.\n\n1. Terence Crawford, 36, undisputed welterweight champion\n\nRecord: 40-0, 31 KOs\nLast fight: July 29 - W, TKO9 vs. Errol Spence Jr.\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 2\n\nIn a career-defining fight, Crawford proved his greatness with a virtuoso performance that resulted in a ninth-round stoppage of Errol Spence Jr. Crawford showed off all his tools in the highly anticipated fight. Among them: uncanny counterpunching ability, unmatched strength and a ruthless killer instinct.\n\nAt 147 pounds, Crawford owns eight KOs in eight fights. The American has developed into a certifiable puncher, and it's hard to see many flaws in his game. An encore bout vs. Spence could come next for the switch-hitting Crawford. But there are other intriguing matchups out there for Crawford, who has plans to move up to 154 pounds in the near future. What about Tim Tszyu? Or if Crawford remains at 147, Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis?\n\nWhomever he fights next, Crawford has proven that he's exactly who he said he was all along.\n\n2. Naoya Inoue, 30, WBC/WBO junior featherweight champion\n\nRecord: 26-0, 23 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 26 - W, KO10 vs. Marlon Tapales\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 1\n\n\"The Monster\" picked up the most impressive win of his career in July, a pulverizing seventh-round TKO of Stephen Fulton. Not only did Inoue knock off the top guy at 122 pounds in his debut at the weight, the Japanese star did so in trademark dominant fashion.\n\nWith a victory on Tuesday vs. Tapales (Inoue won by 10th-round KO), Inoue can become undisputed champion for the second time in 12 months spanning two weight divisions -- an unprecedented achievement for an unprecedented fighter.\n\nAlready, Inoue has reigned atop four weight classes. How far can he continue to climb in weight? He told ESPN on Tuesday that he plans to remain at 122 pounds for the foreseeable future, where future matchups with Luis Nery and Murodjon Akhmadaliev could await assuming Inoue pushes past Tapales.\n\n3. Oleksandr Usyk, 36, WBA/WBO/IBF heavyweight champion\n\nRecord: 21-0, 14 KOS\nLast fight: Aug. 26 - W, KO9 vs. Daniel Dubois\nNext fight: Feb. 17 vs. Tyson Fury\nPrevious ranking: No. 3\n\nThe Ukrainian finally fought in a heavyweight title bout against someone other than Anthony Joshua, and again Usyk proved his power carried to heavyweight with a ninth-round KO of Daniel Dubois.\n\nAt long last, Usyk meets Tyson Fury in February in one of the best heavyweight championship clashes (on paper) in recent memory. Usyk has a chance to cement himself as one of the all-time greats if he's able to beat Fury and become the undisputed heavyweight champion.\n\n4. Dmitry Bivol, 33, WBA light heavyweight champion\n\nRecord: 21-0, 11 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 5 - W, UD12 vs. Gilberto Ramirez\nNext fight: Dec. 23 vs. Lyndon Arthur\nPrevious ranking: No. 5\n\nBivol was 2022 ESPN's Fighter of the Year, but he still hasn't competed during this campaign. That changes Saturday when the smooth-boxing Russian defends his title against Lyndon Arthur in a bout he's heavily favored to win.\n\nBivol lost some momentum after he knocked off Canelo Alvarez with his inactivity this year -- he underwent right hand surgery in April -- but can gain it all back if he's able to land a clash with Artur Beterbiev next year for the undisputed light heavyweight championship.\n\n5. Canelo Alvarez, 33, undisputed super middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 60-2-2, 39 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - W, UD12 vs. Jermell Charlo\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 6 \n\nAlvarez remains boxing's top star and reminded everyone he's still one of the sport's best, too. Following hand surgery last October, Alvarez returned to Guadalajara with a win over John Ryder in a slugfest in front of 50,000-plus fans.\n\nFor an encore, the Mexican defeated Jermell Charlo -- who moved up two divisions -- with ease. He scored a knockdown and afterward declared \"Nobody can beat this Canelo.\" The one man who might be able to is David Benavidez, who is the public's clear-cut top choice for an Alvarez meeting in 2024.\n\n6. Devin Haney, 25, undisputed lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 31-0, 15 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 9 - W, UD12 vs. Regis Prograis\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 9\n\nThere were questions regarding Haney's power and punch resistance ahead of his 140-pound debut. The 25-year-old provided resounding answers in the form of his shutout victory over Regis Prograis this month.\n\nHaney floored Prograis, absorbed only 38 punches -- a CompuBox record for a championship fight -- and was the only one who inflicted damage. He's no longer the undisputed lightweight champion, but Haney is elite and on his way to stardom. Now he just needs the super fights. Ryan Garcia could be next.\n\n7. Artur Beterbiev, 38, WBC/WBO/IBF light heavyweight champion\n\nRecord: 19-0, 19 KOs\nLast fight: Jan. 28 - W, TKO8 vs. Anthony Yarde\nNext fight: Jan. 13 vs. Callum Smith\nPrevious ranking: No. 8\n\nBeterbiev turns 39 next month, but he's shown no signs of slowing down yet. The Russian-Canadian remains boxing's only champion with a 100% knockout ratio and is elite at breaking down foes.\n\nBeterbiev has shown a somewhat vulnerable chin -- he was dropped by Callum Johnson and stunned in the thrilling Anthony Yarde fight -- but he always recovers. If Beterbiev can turn back another tough challenger in Callum Smith, he could move on to a long-awaited showdown with Bivol for the undisputed light heavyweight championship.\n\n8. Gervonta Davis, 29, WBA \"regular\" lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 29-0, 27 KOs\nLast fight: April 22 - W, KO7 vs. Ryan Garcia\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 16\n\n\"Tank\" Davis is coming off the biggest win of his career, a seventh-round KO of Ryan Garcia in April's superfight that cemented him as one of sport's top draws. Davis, however, ended up in jail following the fight?? after he violated house arrest.\n\nAnd while he was the winner, it was Garcia, the KO victim, who was back in the ring before the conclusion of 2023. Davis still doesn't have a scheduled fight, but when he does return to the ring, he'll do so in search of another rousing performance that shows off his precise timing, counter-punching ability and power.\n\n9. Teofimo Lopez Jr., 26, WBO junior welterweight champion\n\nRecord: 19-1, 13 KOs\nLast fight: June 10 - W, UD12 vs. Josh Taylor\nNext fight: Feb. 8 vs. Jamaine Ortiz\nPrevious ranking: No. 36 \n\nLopez reminded the world just how good he is when he's on his game with a superb outing against Josh Taylor in June. Lopez was an underdog against the former undisputed champion following three consecutive lackluster performances, but he was a completely different fighter on that night.\n\nLopez returned to his fun self in the ring. He showboated while he connected on power shots and made Taylor miss badly in return. That version of Lopez is an incredibly tough out for anyone in the division.\n\n10. Tyson Fury, 35, WBC and lineal heavyweight champion\n\nRecord: 34-0-1, 24 KOs\nLast fight: Oct 28 - W, SD10 vs. Francis Ngannou\nNext fight: Feb. 17 vs. Oleksandr Usyk\nPrevious ranking: No. 4 \n\n\"The Gypsy King\" is an all-time great, but it's fair to wonder if he's starting to slow down following his performance against Francis Ngannou. It's probable that Fury didn't take the former UFC star seriously -- he claims there was a hard 12-week training camp -- but he was still dropped and only escaped with a split decision.\n\nThe good news: Fury has a chance to erase that outing with ??a summit meeting against Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia, the biggest heavyweight championship fight in recent memory.\n\n11. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez, 23, junior bantamweight\n\nRecord: 19-0, 12 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 16 - TKO 9 vs. Sunny Edwards\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 19\n\n\"Bam\" Rodriguez, ESPN's top fighter under the age of 25, proved his greatness with a spellbinding performance in the toughest matchup of his career. With an active jab, an uncanny ability to cut off the ring and punch variety, Rodriguez busted up Sunny Edwards' face and broke him down.\n\nWith a right hand that planted Edwards on the canvas at the end of Round 9, Rodriguez placed a punctuation mark on the performance to cement himself as the world's best flyweight. Next up could be a meeting with future Hall of Famer Juan Francisco Estrada.\n\n12. David Benavidez, 26, WBC interim super middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 28-0, 24 KOs\nLast fight: Nov, 25 - W, TKO6 vs. Demetrius Andrade\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 17 \n\n\"The Mexican Monster\" truly broke out this year with impressive victories over Caleb Plant and Demetrius Andrade. There's only one man left for Benavidez to fight, and that's Canelo Alvarez.\n\nBenavidez has earned the shot against boxing's top attraction, and it's easily the biggest realistic fight out there for Canelo. With his nonstop pressure, volume punching and size, Benavidez presents a stiff challenge for Alvarez. Now, he needs to get him in the ring.\n\n13. Vasiliy Lomachenko, 35, lightweight\n\nRecord: 17-3, 11 KOs\nLast fight: May 20 - L, UD12 vs. Devin Haney\nNext fight: April/May vs. George Kambosos Jr.\nPrevious ranking: No. 14\n\nLomachenko was considered over the hill by many entering the Devin Haney fight. After all, Loma struggled to a decision win over Jamaine Ortiz prior. But against Haney, Lomachenko proved that he's still elite.\n\nHe consistently beat Haney to the punch, still possessing his trademark foot speed and expert use of angles. He didn't earn the decision, but he won over the crowd and showed he's still the same fighter headed for the Hall of Fame. Next up is a clash with George Kambosos Jr. in April or May in Australia for the vacant IBF lightweight title.\n\n14. Shakur Stevenson, 26, WBC lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 21-0, 10 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 16 - W, UD12 vs. Edwin De Los Santos\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 10\n\nStevenson is an uber-talented boxer, an Olympic silver medalist capable of rendering his opponent's best weapon useless. He's already won titles in three weight classes and barely lost a round, but Stevenson has yet to face top-flight opposition.\n\nAgainst perhaps his best foe yet, Stevenson escaped with a razor-thin decision win in a lackluster performance against Edwin De Los Santos that dropped him a few spots on this list. However, it would be a surprise if Stevenson didn't rebound and concludes 2024 back inside the top 10.\n\n15. Juan Francisco Estrada, 33, WBC and lineal junior bantamweight champion\n\nRecord: 44-3, 28 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 3, 2022 - W, MD12 vs. Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 11\n\nThe Mexican cemented himself as an all-time great by emerging from his trilogy with Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez up 2-1. Estrada didn't fight in 2023, but he was ringside last week in Arizona for Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez's win over Sunny Edwards. Promoter Eddie Hearn said he'll look to match Estrada and Rodriguez next. No matter what Estrada ends up doing, he's already secured a place for himself in the Hall of Fame.\n\n16. Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez, 36, junior bantamweight\n\nRecord: 51-4, 41 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 3 - L, MD12 vs. Juan Francisco Estrada\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 13\n\nGonzalez's career could be winding down now that he's 36, but he's been counted out before. \"Chocolatito\" enjoyed an incredible resurgence following his brutal KO loss to Srisaket Sor Rungvisai. Not only did Gonzalez deliver another terrific performance in his dominant win over Julio Cesar Martinez last year; the Nicaraguan arguably won both of his recent bouts with Estrada. Whatever Gonzalez does next, the boxing world will be anxiously waiting.\n\n17. Errol Spence Jr., 33, welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 28-1, 22 KOs\nLast fight: July 29 - L, TKO9 vs. Terence Crawford\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 2\n\nSpence's future is in doubt after he was systematically picked apart by Terence Crawford in their July summit meeting at 147 pounds. Spence has been a stalwart of the top 10, but age, inactivity and most of all, a host of serious injuries, could be catching up to him. Spence already survived a horrific car accident that hospitalized him in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, Spence underwent surgery to repair a detached retina and thus his scheduled fight with Manny Pacquiao was scrapped. After the loss to Crawford, Spence said he would move up in weight. He exercised the rematch clause with Crawford, but it's \"Bud\" who will select the weight. However, the rematch still isn't set.\n\n18. Junto Nakatani, 25, WBO junior bantamweight champion\n\nRecord: 26-0, 19 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 18 - W, UD12 vs. Argi Cortez\nNext fight: Feb. 24 vs. Alexandro Santiago\nPrevious ranking: No. 35\n\nJapan's Nakatani authored perhaps the most stunning KO of 2023 when he unloaded a perfectly timed overhand left that rendered Andrew Moloney senseless in a heap. The May victory made Nakatani a two-division champion, but he's already off to 118 pounds for a crack at Alexandro Santiago's WBC bantamweight title in February in Tokyo.\n\n19. Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis, 26, IBF welterweight champion\n\nRecord: 31-0, 28 KOs\nLast fight: July 8 - W, KO10 vs. Roiman Villa\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 25\n\n\"Boots\" Ennis took another step forward in 2023 toward what many in the boxing industry have long believed is his eventual place in the pound-for-pound top 10. Ennis, an athletically gifted puncher from Philadelphia, is now a champion after Crawford was stripped.\n\nHe once again showed off his tremendous power with his KO of the rugged Roiman Villa in July, a bout which was Ennis' first notable TV main event. Now, Ennis needs the sort of opponent where he can truly test his skills.\n\n20. Tim Tszyu, 29, WBO junior middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 24-0, 17 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 15 - W, UD12 vs. Brain Mendoza\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 54\n\nTszyu could have waited after Charlo's hand injury postponed their January bout. Instead, Tszyu fought three times and scored impressive wins over Tony Harrison, Carlos Ocampo and Brian Mendoza. The son of Hall of Famer Kosta Tszyu, Tim Tszyu looks like a force to be reckoned with between his punch variety, power and underrated defense.\n\n21. Emanuel Navarrete, 28, WBO junior lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 38-1-1, 31 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 16 - Draw, MD12 vs. Robson Conceicao\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 31\n\nThe Mexican has quickly proven that he's far more than just an action fighter, though he continues to deliver entertainment every time out. Navarrete became a three-division champion earlier this year with a thrilling come-from-behind TKO victory over Liam Wilson.\n\n\"Vaquero\" went on to dominate Oscar Valdez before a tougher-than-expected draw with Conceicao. Navarrete underwent left hand surgery after the fight but expects to be ready in early 2024.\n\n22. Kenshiro Teraji, 31, WBA/WBC junior flyweight champion\n\nRecord: 22-1, 14 KOS\nLast fight: Sept. 18 - W, TKO9 vs. Hekkie Budler\nNext fight: Jan. 23 vs. Carlos Canizales\nPrevious ranking: No. 26 \n\nThe Japanese phenom once again showed off his power with a ninth-round stoppage of former champion Hekkie Budler. Now, Teraji will prepare to defend his unified championship against another tough challenger in Carlos Canizales next month.\n\n23. David Morrell, 25, WBA \"regular\" super middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 9-0, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 16 - W, TKO2 vs. Sena Agbeko\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 40 \n\nMorrell looks like a future star; now he needs proper opposition to prove he can fight like this on the top level. The Cuban has been hoping for a shot at David Benavidez, but instead has settled for feasting on subpar talent like Sena Agbeko, whom Morrell needed just two rounds to stop in the Showtime finale on Dec. 16. The year 2024 should be when Morrell truly breaks out.\n\n24. Subriel Matias, 31, IBF junior welterweight champion\n\nRecord: 20-1, 20 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 25 - W, TKO6 vs. Shohjahon Ergashev\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 45\n\nA volume-punching machine from Puerto Rico, Matias has earned status as the one man no one is looking to fight. With his strength, power and willingness to absorb punches to land his own, Matias is can't-miss TV. All Matias is missing is the super fight he richly deserves.\n\n25. Jermell Charlo, 33, WBC/WBA junior middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 35-2-1, 19 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - L, UD12 vs. Canelo Alvarez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 12 \n\nCharlo moved up to 168 pounds and appeared content to survive against Alvarez. Charlo wasn't remotely aggressive, was knocked down and never threatened to win. He still remains the top fighter at 154 pounds, where he indicated he would return. Whether that rescheduled matchup with Tim Tszyu materializes is another matter. Charlo was set to fight Tszyu in January before he suffered a broken hand.\n\n26. Kazuto Ioka, 34, WBA junior bantamweight champion\n\nRecord: 30-2-1, 15 KOs\nLast fight: June 24 - W, UD12 vs. Joshua Franco\nNext fight: Dec. 31 vs. Josber Perez\nPrevious ranking: No. 22\n\nJapan's Ioka left no doubt in the rematch with Joshua Franco to remain one of the best in the stacked 115-pound division. Assuming he's successful on New Year's Eve, Ioka could at long last grab the sort of marquee fight he's looking for in 2024, whether that comes against Juan Francisco Estrada, Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez or Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez.\n\n27. Deontay Wilder, 38, heavyweight\n\nRecord: 43-2-1, 42 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 15 - W, KO1 vs. Robert Helenius\nNext fight: Dec. 23 vs. Joseph Parker\nPrevious ranking: No. 23 \n\nArguably the biggest puncher in heavyweight championship history, Wilder's career has been marked by inactivity lately. Since his hellacious KO loss to Fury in November 2021 in ESPN's Fight of the Year, Wilder has competed only one round. That changes Saturday when he meets fellow former champ Joseph Parker in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWith a victory -- and also a win from Anthony Joshua over Wallin -- Wilder will move on to a March 9 bout with Joshua that's been long-awaited.\n\n28. Anthony Joshua, 34, heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 26-3, 23 KOs\nLast fight: Aug. 12 - W, KO7 vs. Robert Helenius\nNext fight: Dec. 23 vs. Otto Wallin\nPrevious ranking: No. 29 \n\nThe British star should have his hands full with Otto Wallin, a mobile southpaw who stands between Joshua and his March 9 fight with Deontay Wilder. Joshua will enter the ring with another new trainer; this time, it's Ben Davison, who replaces Derrick James.\n\nJoshua was a seek-and-destroy fighter before his shocking upset loss to Andy Ruiz Jr. in 2019. He hasn't shown that form since, but remains an effective boxer who knows how to set up his power shots. If he can defeat Wallin and Wilder in succession, Joshua's legacy will be secure.\n\n29. Stephen Fulton, 29, junior featherweight contender\n\nRecord: 21-1, 8 KOs\nLast fight: July 25 - L, TKO8 vs. Naoya Inoue\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 18\n\nThe Philadelphian impressed during his title reign at 122 pounds, but it came to a screeching halt against Naoya Inoue, who dismantled Fulton. Now, the talented boxer will look to establish himself at featherweight, where plentiful tasty matchups exist. After all, Fulton is a boxer who routinely throws upward of 1,000 punches per bout and can fight on both the inside and outside with effectiveness.\n\n30. Jack Catterall, 30, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 28-1, 13 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 21 - W, UD12 vs. Jorge Linares\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 33 \n\nA tricky boxer with superb timing and underrated power, Catterall is still searching for a rematch with Josh Taylor after he dropped a controversial decision to the Scot last year. A fight with Richardson Hitchins could be on the horizon after the IBF recently ordered the title eliminator.\n\n31. Jai Opetaia, 28, cruiserweight contender\n\nRecord: 23-0, 18 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - W, TKO4 vs. Jordan Thompson\nNext fight: Dec. 23 vs. Ellis Zorro\nPrevious ranking: No. 78\n\nThe Australian is clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the cruiserweight division. A powerful puncher with great snap on his shots, Opetaia vacated his IBF title rather than turn down a career-high payday to fight Zorro on Saturday in Saudi Arabia.\n\n32. Zhilei Zhang, 40, WBO interim heavyweight champion\n\nRecord: 26-1-1, 21 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 23 - W, KO3 vs. Joe Joyce\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nA surprisingly mobile southpaw at 6-foot-6, 280-plus pounds, Zhang is on the cusp of a title shot after back-to-back stoppage wins over Joe Joyce. It took until age 40, but China's Zhang looks like a dangerous opponent for anyone at heavyweight with his crisp jab and ability to box off the back foot.\n\n33. Leigh Wood, 35, junior lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 28-3, 17 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 7 - W, TKO7 vs. Josh Warrington\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 49\n\nWood continues to improve with age and came through with his best campaign yet in 2023. He started the year with a TKO loss to Mauricio Lara, but avenged it in the May rematch before he stopped Josh Warrington.\n\nWood has since vacated his featherweight title and will now compete at 130 pounds, where he could meet Joe Cordina in 2024.\n\n34. Josh Taylor, 32, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 19-1, 13 KOs\nLast fight: June 10 - L, UD12 vs. Teofimo Lopez Jr.\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 15\n\nScotland's Taylor was the favorite entering his June bout with Teofimo Lopez Jr., but he wasn't competitive with \"The Takeover.\" Taylor announced plans to move up to welterweight, but the former undisputed champion still doesn't have a return bout scheduled. A rematch with Catterall, who he beat in controversial fashion, is probably the most appetizing option out there.\n\n35. Caleb Plant, 31, super middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 22-2, 13 KOs\nLast fight: March 25 - L, UD12 vs. David Benavidez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 30\n\nPlant boxed well during the first half of his fight with David Benavidez, but he was broken down over the second half. Still, Plant never stopped trying to win and showed plenty of courage down the stretch. His only other defeat came via TKO against Canelo Alvarez.\n\nNo shame in losing to the likes of those two fighters, but at some point, Plant must score a victory over an elite fighter to hold his ranking. He's been calling for a fight with Jermall Charlo, whom he attacked at the Crawford-Spence weigh-in.\n\n36. Regis Prograis, 34, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 29-2, 24 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 9 - L, UD12 vs. Devin Haney\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 28\n\nPrograis came up just short when he traveled to the U.K. to take on Josh Taylor in 2019. In his second fight at the top level, Prograis was floored by Devin Haney and lost every round on all three scorecards.\n\nPrograis indicated he would remain at 140 pounds, where he'll look to become a three-time champion. But he'll have to shake off two poor performances; he eked by Danielito Zorrilla via split decision in June.\n\n37. Jermall Charlo, 33, WBC middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 33-0, 22 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 25 - W, UD10 vs. Jose Benavidez Jr.\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 24 \n\nCharlo remains the WBC middleweight titleholder despite no defenses since June 2021. And when he finally did return, Charlo did so at a catchweight closer to 168 pounds with a wide-points victory over Jose Benavidez Jr. Still, Charlo could land a shot at Canelo Alvarez next year in a chance at revenge for his twin brother, who lost to Alvarez in September.\n\n38. Brandon Figueroa, 26, WBC interim featherweight champion\n\nRecord: 24-1-1, 18 KOs\nLast fight: March 4 - W, UD12 vs. Mark Magsayo\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 42\n\nFigueroa made a successful featherweight debut with an exciting victory over Mark Magsayo in March. However, Figueroa didn't compete for the remainder of this year. Now that Stephen Fulton is set to campaign at 126 pounds, too, a rematch of their 2021 meeting makes a lot of sense.\n\n39. Carlos Adames, 29, WBC interim middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 23-1, 18 KOs\nLast fight: June 24 - W, TKO9 vs. Julian Williams\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 74\n\nThe Dominican looks like the best 160-pounder out there following a string of dominant performances, most recently a stoppage of Julian Williams in June. Adames has been patiently waiting for his shot at Jermall Charlo, but the WBC still hasn't ordered the bout.\n\n40. Sunny Edwards, 27, IBF flyweight champion\n\nRecord: 20-0, 4 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 16 - L, TKO9 vs. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 27\n\nThe slick boxer from England showed tremendous courage against Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez, but suffered his first loss all the same. Edwards said he fought through a fractured orbital and couldn't see out of the left eye following Round 2. He had his moments, but he didn't have the power to keep Rodriguez off him.\n\n41. Ryan Garcia, 25, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 24-1, 20 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 2 - W, KO8 vs. Oscar Duarte\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 32\n\nGarcia rebounded from his loss to \"Tank\" Davis with a KO victory over Duarte earlier this month. Garcia, at times, looked uncomfortable in the face of Duarte's pressure and unveiled an ineffective shoulder roll he vowed to never use again.\n\nDespite that, Garcia remains an athletic power-puncher with perhaps the quickest hands in boxing, and he put it all together to grab another KO win. Garcia still must improve his boxing technique, and if he can, he'll be tough for anyone to deal with given his other attributes.\n\n42. Vergil Ortiz Jr., 25, welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 19-0, 19 KOs\nLast fight: Aug. 6, 2022 - W, TKO9 vs. Michael McKinson\nNext fight: Jan. 6 vs. Fredrick Lawson\nPrevious ranking: No. 34\n\nOrtiz endured a lost 2023 as his matchup with Eimantas Stanionis was postponed three times. The second cancellation came as Ortiz dealt with the recurring effects of rhabdomyolysis before he encountered weight-cutting issues in July.\n\nNow, Ortiz will make his 154-pound debut against journeyman Fredrick Lawson as he looks to his carry his vaunted power to a new weight and realize his vast promise.\n\n43. Eimantas Stanionis, 29, WBA \"regular\" welterweight champion\n\nRecord: 14-0, 9 KOs\nLast fight: April 16 - W, SD12 vs. Radzhab Butaev\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 53\n\nStanionis, like Ortiz, didn't fight at all in 2023 after their ill-fated matchup was scrapped three times. Unlike Ortiz, Stanionis doesn't even have a fight scheduled. There was talk of him meeting Keith Thurman in December, but the bout never materialized.\n\nThe Lithuanian is a strong, effective pressure fighter, but he needs far more activity going forward.\n\n44. Janibek Alimkhanuly, 30, WBO/IBF middleweight champion\n\nRecord: 15-0, 10 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 14 - W, TKO6 vs. Vincenzo Gualtieri\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 90\n\nThe Kazakh is an effective puncher at mid-range between his stinging jab and straight right hands. Janibek is now a unified champion, but his opposition remains woeful in one of the sport's weakest divisions. A bout with Adames would solve what Janibek is missing.\n\n45. Marlon Tapales, 31, WBC/WBA junior featherweight champion\n\nRecord: 37-3, 19 KOs\nLast fight: April 8 - W, SD12 vs. Murodjon Akhmadaliev\nNext fight: Dec. 26 vs. Naoya Inoue\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe Filipino scored the biggest win of his career with his upset victory over Akhmadaliev, which made him a two-division champ. It also landed Tapales a career-high payday for his fight Tuesday against Inoue for the undisputed championship. Tapales is now one more upset away from boxing immortality.\n\n46. Luis Alberto Lopez, 30, IBF featherweight champion\n\nRecord: 29-2, 16 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 15 - W, UD12 vs. Joet Gonzalez\nNext fight: March 2 vs. Reiya Abe\nPrevious ranking: No. 62\n\nThe Mexican pressure fighter followed up a breakthrough 2022 campaign with an even better 2023. He defended his title twice successfully: a brutal fifth-round TKO of Michael Conlan followed by a wide decision win over Joet Gonzalez.\n\nLopez's next defense, against Reiya Abe on March 2, is paired with Otabek Kholmatov vs. Raymond Ford, who are fighting for the vacant WBA title. Lopez could unify with the winner next.\n\n47. Jose Ramirez, 31, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 28-1, 18 KOs\nLast fight: March 25 - W, KO11 vs. Richard Commey\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 44\n\nRamirez, like many other fighters on this list, has been plagued by inactivity. The last year he competed more than once: 2019. The Mexican-American was offered a Feb. 8 showdown with Teofimo Lopez, but turned it down as he closes in on a multi-fight promotional deal with Golden Boy, where he could fit as a future foe for Ryan Garcia.\n\n48. Murodjon Akhmadaliev, 29, junior featherweight contender\n\nRecord: 11-1, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 16 - W, TKO 8 vs. Kevin Gonzalez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 20\n\nThe Uzbek shockingly dropped a tight decision to Tapales and saw his proposed undisputed title fight with Inoue vanish. Akhmadaliev looked good in his return and is positioned for a meaningful fight in 2024, perhaps against Inoue.\n\n49. Callum Smith, 33, light heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 29-1, 21 KOs\nLast fight: Aug. 20 - W, KO4 vs. Mathieu Bauderlique\nNext fight: Jan. 13 vs. Artur Beterbiev\nPrevious ranking: No. 50\n\nSmith wasn't remotely competitive when he fought Canelo in 2022 and suffered a ruptured bicep as Alvarez targeted his lead weapon. Now, Smith has another chance to prove himself on the big stage with an opportunity to become a two-division champion against Beterbiev next month.\n\nAt light heavyweight, Smith has proven to be a dangerous puncher albeit against limited opposition.\n\n50. George Kambosos Jr., 30, lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 21-2, 10 KOs\nLast fight: July 22 - W, MD12 vs. Maxi Hughes\nNext fight: April/May vs. Vasiliy Lomachenko\nPrevious ranking: No. 48\n\nThe Australian grabbed a controversial decision victory over Maxi Hughes and is once again in line for a crack at a lightweight title. Kambosos is in the process of finalizing a deal to meet Lomachenko in April or May in Australia, per sources.\n\nKambosos is still living off his upset victory over Teofimo Lopez. At some point, he'll need to score another big win.\n\n51. William Zepeda, 27, lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 29-0, 25 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 16 - W, KO6 vs. Mercito Gesta\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 56\n\nZepeda is one of the sport's most exciting fighters. The Mexican unloaded 1,500-plus punches in his win over Joseph \"JoJo\" Diaz and has topped the 1,000-punch plateau on multiple other occasions.\n\nNo one has been able to withstand Zepeda's nonstop punching yet. Now, Zepeda needs a top-flight opponent.\n\n52. Jaime Munguia, 27, middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 42-0, 33 KOs\nLast fight: June 10 - W, UD12 vs. Sergiy Derevyanchenko\nNext fight: Jan. 27 vs. John Ryder\nPrevious ranking: No. 70\n\nMunguia is coming off the best win of his career, and he dug deep to grab it. His 12th-round knockdown of Sergiy Derevyanchenko was the difference on the scorecards, and is on the short list for fight-of-the-year honors.\n\nNow, Munguia figures to be tested more than ever when he meets the tough and durable John Ryder in January.\n\n53. Rafael Espinoza, 29, WBO featherweight champion\n\nRecord: 24-0, 20 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 9 - W, UD12 vs. Robeisy Ramirez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nEspinoza was little more than an afterthought heading into his first career title shot. But he more than made good on the opportunity by scoring a 12th-round knockdown that pulled out the major upset victory over Robeisy Ramirez.\n\nAt 6-foot-1 and the ability to fight on the inside as well, Espinoza figures to be a challenge for anyone at 126 pounds. He also proved his toughness when he survived a knockdown against Ramirez, and a rematch could come next year.\n\n54. John Ryder, 35, super middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 32-6, 18 KOs\nLast fight: May 6 - L, UD12 vs. Canelo Alvarez\nNext fight: Jan. 27 vs. Jaime Munguia\nPrevious ranking: No. 52\n\nRyder suffered a broken nose in the loss to Canelo Alvarez, but survived a knockdown and landed some heavy shots against an elite fighter. The Englishman has another chance at a big victory when he meets Jaime Munguia as a minor underdog next month.\n\n55. Joe Cordina, 32, IBF junior lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 17-0, 9 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 4 - W, MD12 vs. Edward Vazquez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 58 \n\nCordina continues his tenuous grip on the IBF lightweight title. First, he squeezed past Shavkat Rakhimov in a hellacious action fight in February. Then, Cordina was pushed to the limit by Edward Vazquez, emerging victorious via majority decision.\n\nIn 2024, Cordina could defend his title against the surging Leigh Wood, who is set to campaign at 130 pounds.\n\n56. Christian Mbilli, 28, super middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 25-0, 21 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 8 - W, KO 4 vs. Demond Nicholson\nNext fight: Jan. 13 vs. Rohan Murdock\nPrevious ranking: N/R \n\nThe action fighter has established himself as an attraction in his adopted hometown of Quebec, Canada. A seek-and-destroy fighter who packs plenty of power into his stout frame, Mbilli is on the cusp of a title opportunity.\n\n57. O'Shaquie Foster, 30, WBC junior lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 21-2, 12 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 28 - W, TKO12 vs. Eduardo Hernandez\nNext fight: Feb. 16 vs. Abraham Nova\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nFoster crashed these rankings in a big way with his performances in 2023. He became a champion when he upset Rey Vargas, and then scored a come-from-behind 12th-round TKO of Rocky Hernandez in October to retain the title.\n\nNext up, Foster meets a fellow puncher in Abraham Nova in his first fight after signing with Top Rank.\n\n58. Sandor Martin, 30, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 42-3, 15 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 16 - W, KO4 vs. Mohamed El Marcouchi\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 61\n\nThe Spaniard has made a career out of playing spoiler. First, he sent Mikey Garcia into retirement with an upset victory. Then, the tricky southpaw dropped a controversial decision to Teofimo Lopez, proving the Garcia win was no fluke.\n\n59. Mark Magsayo, 28, junior lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 25-2, 17 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 9 - W, KO3 vs. Isaac Avelar\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 65\n\nThe Filipino announced his arrival at 130 pounds in his debut at the weight with a highlight-reel KO earlier this month. Magsayo has proven to be more than just a puncher, though, between his upset win over Gary Russell Jr., and his tight-decision loss to Brandon Figueroa.\n\n60. Mario Barrios, 28, WBC interim welterweight champion\n\nRecord: 28-2, 18 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - W, UD12 vs. Yordenis Ugas\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe Texan performed well in defeats to Keith Thurman and Gervonta Davis, but finally grabbed the victory he needed with a dominant showing against Yordenis Ugas in September. With Terence Crawford expected to vacate his WBC title, Barrios has emerged as a popular name at welterweight, whether it's Devin Haney or Conor Benn.\n\n61. Mauricio Lara, 25, featherweight contender\n\nRecord: 26-3-1, 19 KOs\nLast fight: May 27 - L, UD12 vs. Leigh Wood\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 47\n\nLara was surging heading into his rematch with Leigh Wood. After all, he had just knocked out the Englishman and already owned a stoppage victory over Josh Warrington. Then Lara missed weight and was soundly outpointed by Wood. But at just 25 the Mexican has plenty of time to rebuild and rebound.\n\n62. Chris Billam-Smith, 33, WBO cruiserweight champion\n\nRecord: 19-1, 13 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 10 - W, TKO8 vs. Mateusz Masternak\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R \n\nEngland's Billam-Smith continues to rack up quality wins at cruiserweight. He scored a majority-decision victory over Lawrence Okolie in May to become a first-time champion and then retained it with a win over Mateusz Masternak earlier this month.\n\n63. Filip Hrgovic, 31, heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 16-0, 13 KOs\nLast fight: Aug. 12 - W, TKO12 vs. Demsey McKean\nNext fight: Dec. 23 vs. Mark De Mori\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe Croatian has proven to be tough, durable and a hard puncher. He's on the cusp of a heavyweight title shot as the IBF's mandatory challenger. That shot should come next year. His best win remains a disputed-decision over Zhilei Zhang in 2022 that has aged gracefully.\n\n64. Julio Cesar Martinez, 28, WBC flyweight champion\n\nRecord: 20-2, 15 KOs\nLast fight: May 6 - W, TKO11 vs. Ronal Batista\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 85\n\nThe free-swinging Mexican was schooled by Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez last year at 115 pounds, but remains champion at 112. He's a dangerous puncher, even if he isn't the most technically sound boxer.\n\nNow that Sunny Edwards has lost to Jesse Rodriguez, perhaps Martinez can meet the Englishman in a long-discussed flyweight title fight.\n\n65. Isaac Cruz, 25, lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 25-2-1, 17 KOs\nLast fight: July 29 - W, SD12 vs. Giovanni Cabrera\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 67\n\n\"Pitbull\" Cruz was lackluster in a split-decision win over Giovanni Cabrera, but remains hopeful he'll land a rematch with Gervonta Davis in early 2024. When they met in 2021, Cruz gave Davis all he could handle.\n\nThe aggressive pressure fighter is a formidable puncher, but he's not going to outbox many foes.\n\n66. Robeisy Ramirez, 30, featherweight contender\n\nRecord: 13-2, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 9 - L, MD12 vs. Rafael Espinoza\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 64\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medalist from Cuba was riding high until a shocking defeat to Rafael Espinoza earlier this month in one of the year's best fights. Ramirez both scored a knockdown and survived one in the loss. Now, he'll look to become a two-time champion.\n\n67. Fernando Martinez, 32, IBF junior bantamweight champion\n\nRecord: 16-0, 9 KOs\nLast fight: June 24 - W, TKO11 vs. Jade Bornea\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 82\n\nThe Argentine remains champion at 115 pounds after a string of solid performances, including a pair of wins over Jerwin Ancajas. With so many top names at his weight, Martinez is sure to land a unification fight sooner than later.\n\n68. Shavkat Rakhimov, 29, junior lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 17-1-1, 14 KOs\nLast fight: April 22 - L, SD12 vs. Joe Cordina\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 68\n\nRakhimov is a reliable action fighter who appears to come up just short each time he steps up in competition. He rallied after being knocked down in each of his last two fights: a title-winning victory over Zelfa Barrett and a split-decision loss to Joe Cordina.\n\nRakhimov is likely to land another title shot at 130 pounds in the near future.\n\n\n69. Conor Benn, 27, welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 22-0, 14 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 23 - W, UD10 vs. Rodolfo Orozco\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 79\n\nBenn is an explosive puncher with impressive athleticism and pedigree. The son of Nigel Benn was in talks to fight Chris Eubank Jr., in February at middleweight, but after the deal fell apart, he'll continue to campaign at welterweight. Benn could be far higher on this list if it weren't for inactivity related to a doping case in the U.K.\n\n70. Demetrius Andrade, 35, super middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 32-1, 19 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 25 - L, TKO6 vs. David Benavidez\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 57\n\n\"Boo Boo\" has long been one of boxing's most-avoided fighters, but when he finally did land the big one, he was demolished by David Benavidez and retired on his stool after Round 6.\n\nAndrade could return to 160 pounds where he formerly held a title. But at 35 and coming off a brutal beating, it's unclear what Andrade has left.\n\n71. Rey Vargas, 33, WBC featherweight champion\n\nRecord: 36-1, 22 KOs\nLast fight: Feb. 11 - L, UD12 vs. O'Shaquie Foster\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 46\n\nVargas remains the WBC featherweight champion, even though he hasn't defended it since he defeated Mark Magsayo via split decision in July 2022. The Mexican moved up to 130 for a crack at a 130-pound title but dropped a decision to O'Shaquie Foster. Now, Vargas figures to return to 126 pounds to defend his belt.\n\n72. Robson Conceicao, 35, junior lightweight\n\nRecord: 17-2-1, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 16 - Draw, MD12 vs. Emanuel Navarrete\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 75\n\nThe Olympic gold medalist from Brazil faced unfair advantages in his first two title challenges. First, Conceicao met Oscar Valdez just weeks after he tested positive for a banned substance. Then, Conceicao fought Shakur Stevenson after he missed weight.\n\nIn his third crack, Conceicao survived two knockdowns to earn a majority draw with Emanuel Navarrete in the sort of performance that gives him new life at 130 pounds. A rematch should happen at some point.\n\n73. Josh Warrington, 33, featherweight contender\n\nRecord: 31-3-1, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 7 - L, TKO7 vs. Leigh Wood\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 63\n\nWarrington has now lost two fights in a row, both title bouts. After he dropped a majority decision to Luis Alberto Lopez, Warrington was ahead on the cards when he was stopped by Leigh Wood in the seventh round.\n\n74. Anthony Yarde, 32, light heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 24-3, 23 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 23 - W, KO2 vs. Jorge Silva\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 69 \n\nEngland's Yarde gave Artur Beterbiev all he could handle in January, but all the same, he was stopped by the Russian in a spirited title challenge, just like when he met Sergey Kovalev in 2019.\n\n75. Otto Wallin, 33, heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 26-1, 14 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - W, SD12 vs. Murat Gassiev\nNext fight: Dec. 23 vs, Anthony Joshua\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nA mobile southpaw, Wallin proved his mettle on the grandest stage when he inflicted a cut over Tyson Fury's right eye that required 47 stitches in a close decision defeat. Now, Wallin enters another big fight on the heels of his best win.\n\nHe outpointed former cruiserweight champion Murat Gassiev in September and will look to hand Anthony Joshua another loss on Saturday.\n\n76. Lawrence Okolie, 31, cruiserweight contender\n\nRecord: 19-1, 14 KOs\nLast fight: May 27 - L, MD12 vs. Chris Billam-Smith\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 73\n\nThe Englishman's lengthy cruiserweight title reign ended in May when he dropped a close decision to Chris Billam-Smith. Okolie hasn't competed since, but given the lack of depth at cruiserweight, he figures to challenge for another title in 2024 if he doesn't elect to move up to heavyweight.\n\n77. Jared Anderson, 24 heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 16-0, 15 KOs\nLast fight: Aug. 26 - W, TKO5 vs. Andrii Rudenko\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\n\"Big Baby\", No. 2 fighters under the gae of 25 by ESPN, scored the best win of his career in July when won virtually every round against former titleholder Charles Martin. Anderson didn't come close to stopping Martin, but he gained valuable experience before he made a quick turnaround with a fifth-round TKO of Andrii Rudenko. Another step-up in class is expected next year.\n\n78. Gilberto \"Zurdo\" Ramirez, 32, cruiserweight contender\n\nRecord: 45-1, 30 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 7 - W, UD10 vs. Joe Smith Jr.\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 86\n\n\"Zurdo\" Ramirez successfully moved up to cruiserweight with a clear, entertaining win over Joe Smith Jr. Now that Jai Opetaia has relinquished the IBF title, Ramirez is positioned to fight Mairis Briedis next year for the vacant belt, where he'll look to become a two-division champ.\n\n79 Chris Eubank Jr. 34, middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 33-3, 24 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 2 - W, TKO10 vs. Liam Smith\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nEubank was stopped by Liam Smith inside six rounds in January, but under the guidance of Brian McIntyre, Eubank turned the tables with a 10th-round stoppage in the September rematch.\n\nEubank entered talks for a rescheduled bout with Conor Benn, but after negotiations fell apart, he's searching for another fight at middleweight.\n\n80. Oscar Valdez Jr., 33, junior lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 31-2, 23 KOs\nLast fight: Aug. 12 - L, UD12 vs. Emanuel Navarrete\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 51\n\nValdez is in desperate need of a big win after he was shellacked by Emanuel Navarrete in August. But after so many grueling fights, Valdez might not be the same fighter at age 33.\n\n81. Radzhab Butaev, 30, welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 15-1, 12 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 6 - W, TKO3 vs. Fazliddin Gaibnazarov\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 80\n\nButaev proved his level in a grueling, split-decision defeat to Eimantas Stanionis last April. He endured a year-and-a-half layoff before he returned last month in Russia with an easy victory. In 2024, Butaev figures to re-enter the welterweight title picture.\n\n82. Joshua Buatsi, 30, light heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 17-0, 13 KOs\nLast fight: May 6 - W, UD10 vs. Pawel Stepien\nNext fight: Feb. 3 vs. Dan Azeez\nPrevious ranking: No. 97\n\nBuatsi is a talented boxer, but at some point he needs to deliver on his promise with a win over a top-flight opponent. His toughest test yet awaits, a rescheduled bout with Dan Azeez that could propel him to a more meaningful fight at light heavyweight.\n\n83. Lamont Roach, 28, WBA junior lightweight champion\n\nRecord: 24-1-1, 9 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 25 - W, SD12 vs. Hector Luis Garcia\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nRoach's first title shot ended in defeat to Jamel Herring in 2019. But Roach came through in his second opportunity with a 12th-round knockdown that grabbed him the win over Hector Luis Garcia. Given the competitiveness of the fight, a rematch could materialize in the future.\n\n84. Jonathan Gonzalez, 32, WBO junior flyweight champion\n\nRecord: 27-3-1, 14 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 1, 2022 - W, UD12 vs. Shokichi Iwata\nNext fight: March 2 vs. TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\n\"Bomba\" Gonzalez remains the WBO champion at 108 pounds, but he didn't compete at all in 2023. In 2024, he'll receive his greatest exposure yet when he competes in his native Puerto Rico on the undercard of a doubleheader that features Amanda Serrano and Jake Paul.\n\n85. David Avanesyan, 35, welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 30-4-1, 18 KOs\nLast fight:Dec. 20 - W, TKO 4 vs. Serge Ambomo\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 84\n\nAvanesyan was on a nice run before he ran into Terence Crawford and was brutally knocked out in December 2022. He remains a player at 147 pounds after his shake-off-the-rust TKO win on Wednesday night over Serge Ambomo.\n\n\n86. Israil Madrimov, 28, junior middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 9-0-1, 6 KOs\nLast fight: April 8 - W, UD10 vs. Raphael Igbokwe\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 94\n\nThe athletic Uzbek has been regarded for his vast promise for years, but he still hasn't landed a major fight nor has he been active. Hopefully that changes in 2024 after a pair of fights with Michel Soro that didn't have conclusive endings.\n\n87. Artem Dalakian, 36, WBA flyweight champion\n\nRecord: 22-0, 15 KOs\nLast fight: Jan. 28 - W, UD12 vs. David Jimenez\nNext fight: Jan. 13 vs. Seigo Yuri Akui\nPrevious ranking: No. 91\n\nThe Ukrainian's long title reign at 112 pounds continues into 2024 with a fight in Japan. Despite his success, Dalakian doesn't appear to be on the radar for a title unification.\n\n88. Jamaine Ortiz, 27, lightweight contender\n\nRecord: 17-1-1, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 15 - W, UD10 vs. Antonio Moran\nNext fight: Feb. 8 vs. Teofimo Lopez Jr.\nPrevious ranking: No. 96\n\nOrtiz impressed during the first half of his loss to Vasiliy Lomachenko, but faded down the stretch. He parlayed that performance into a title shot against Teofimo Lopez Jr. in February. And at 140 pounds, Ortiz figures to be stronger and more effective.\n\n89. Luis Nery, 29, junior featherweight contender\n\nRecord: 35-1, 27 KOs\nLast fight: July 8 - W, TKO2 vs. Froilan Saludar\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nNery's 11th-round KO over Azat Hovhannisyan in February is on the list for fight-of-the-year honors. The action-fighting Mexican is in line for a title shot and could be next for Inoue.\n\n90. Brian Mendoza, 29, junior middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 22-3, 16 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 15 - L, UD12 vs. Tim Tszyu\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nMendoza entered 2023 on the heels of a brutal, upset KO win over Jeison Rosario. And he scored another such victory over Sebastian Fundora in April. But his streak of upsets ended when he was battered by Tim Tszyu in October.\n\n91. Sebastian Fundora, 25, junior middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 20-1-1, 13 KOs\nLast fight: April 8 - L, KO7 vs. Brian Mendoza\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 43\n\nThe 6-foot-5 154-pounder appeared to be a confounding puzzle for opponents, but Brian Mendoza solved Fundora with a seventh-round KO. Fundora hasn't competed since, but a rematch with Mendoza makes all the sense for 2024.\n\n92. Elijah Garcia, 20, middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 16-0, 13 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - W, TKO 8 vs. Jose Armando Resendiz\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe 20-year-old phenom is quickly ascending the 160-pound rankings. With his blend of power, boxing smarts and aggressiveness, Garcia could challenge for a title sooner than later. He's one of the top fighters under 25.\n\n93. Frank Martin, 28, lightweight\n\nRecord: 18-0, 12 KOs\nLast fight: July 15 - W, UD12 vs. Artem Harutyunyan\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe athletic boxer-puncher was slated to meet Shakur Stevenson in his first title shot before he ultimately withdrew due to financial demands. Now, Martin is left without a scheduled fight and will end the year with just one bout.\n\n94. Richardson Hitchins, 26, junior welterweight contender\n\nRecord: 17-0, 7 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 23 - W, UD12 vs. Jose Zepeda\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe tricky boxer scored his best win yet when he outpointed Jose Zepeda in September. Next up could be Jack Catterall after the IBF ordered the title eliminator.\n\n95. Erickson Lubin, 28, junior middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 26-2, 18 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 30 - W, UD12 vs. Jesus Ramos\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nLubin's future was in doubt after he suffered serious injuries in his brutal loss to Sebastian Fundora last year. But the American rebounded in a big way with wins over Luis Arias and Jesus Ramos.\n\n96. Sam Goodman, 25, junior featherweight contender\n\nRecord:17-0, 7 KOs\nLast fight: Dec. 15 - W, UD12 vs. Zhong Liu\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe Australian pressure fighter has quickly emerged with dominant wins over Ra'esse Aleem and Miguel Flores. He could soon establish himself as a viable opponent for Naoya Inoue.\n\n97. Liam Smith, 35, middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 33-4-1, 20 KOs\nLast fight: Sept. 2 - L, TKO10 vs. Chris Eubank Jr.\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: No. 93\n\nSmith was riding high after his upset, KO victory over Chris Eubank Jr., but his fellow Englishman turned the tables in September. It's unclear where Smith goes from here.\n\n98. Martin Bakole, 30, heavyweight contender\n\nRecord: 20-1, 15 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 28 - W, TKO4 vs. Carlos Takam\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe bruising heavyweight upset Tony Yoka last year and continued to impress in 2023 with a quick KO of the durable Carlos Takam. Bakole is in line for a meaningful heavyweight bout in 2024.\n\n99. Ginjiro Shigeoka, 24, IBF strawweight champion\n\nRecord: 10-0, 8 KOs\nLast fight: Oct. 7 - W, TKO5 vs. Daniel Valladares\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe 105-pound champion from Japan is a formidable puncher, and a future fight with countryman Kenshiro Teraji shapes up as a big fight in Tokyo. He's a young fighter with a big upside.\n\n100. Diego Pacheco, 22, super middleweight contender\n\nRecord: 20-0, 17 KOs\nLast fight: Nov. 18 - W, KO9 vs. Marcelo Coceres\nNext fight: TBA\nPrevious ranking: N/R\n\nThe longtime prospect graduated to contender status in 2023 with more impressive wins punctuated by a ninth-round KO of Marcelo Coceres, who gave Edgar Berlanga all he could handle years ago.

        "authors": "Nate Saunders",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "On paper, Sergio Perez was a shoo-in for a slot in our top ten F1 drivers of 2023. He was one of two not named Max Verstappen to win a race and he finished second to the Dutchman in the world championship.\n\nAnd yet, he's not made the cut on ESPN's list, which you can read in full here. It's of course entirely subjective, but the fact this question is even open for debate highlights the kind of year Perez had. His form was so erratic that much of the narrative around him was whether he would still be driving for Red Bull in 2024. He will be, but that question will be lingering right on the surface next year.\n\nWas his season really bad enough to not be considered top ten? As always, these things are about context. There's a key caveat in the list compiled by my colleague Laurence Edmondson earlier this month that the rankings are \"based on the car they had at their disposal, the stage they are at in their career and the expectations they faced going into the season,\" so let's break it down like that.\n\nThe car at his disposal\n\nThis is perhaps the most damming part of Perez's year. The RB19 will go down as the most dominant car in modern F1 history - previously one-sided seasons of Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton pale in comparison to what Verstappen achieved. Perez was blessed with one of the finest F1 cars any team has built in recent memory but finished with half the points tally of his teammate. While Red Bull celebrated constructors' championship success, Verstappen's results would have won it single-handedly.\n\nYou could argue Verstappen's incredible form made the RB19 look better than it was, but the margin of many of his wins showed how much pace there was to find. While Verstappen may well have won the same number of races alongside an in-form Perez, his teammate should have been on the podium most weekends. From his second and final win in Baku onwards, Perez visited the podium just six times -- in the same timespan, Lando Norris had seven podiums, while Hamilton and Charles Leclerc had five each, the three of them doing so in cars inferior to the RB19.\n\nFor whatever reason Perez just couldn't get on top of it. The Mexican driver's problems seemed to be rooted in qualifying, where poor performances often put his RB19 out of position and forced him to play catch up in the race. A heavy crash in qualifying at the Monaco Grand Prix, a race he won 12 months prior, summed up the season that was to follow, leaving him with the prospect of a frustrating Sunday ahead.\n\nThe stage he's at in his career\n\nPerez is one of the most experienced drivers on the grid with 257 starts -- only Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton have started more races -- and it was surprising to see his year fall apart so dramatically and rapidly. Sure, Verstappen has become the ultimate teammate killer on the grid, with Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon both struggling to match him in their stints in the same car. You can also point to how the results shifted towards Verstappen and away from Daniel Ricciardo in the latter part of 2018, after the Australian had confirmed his intention to drive elsewhere the following year. But, as one of the grid's longest serving drivers, Perez is at a different point in his career to all three of his predecessors in his seat and more was expected from him as a result. Perez never got himself out of the downward spiral he hit from Monaco onwards. His mistake at the start of the Mexican Grand Prix looked more like an over-eager young driver than one of the grid's elder statesmen.\n\nBefore Red Bull, Perez made a habit of overperforming in cars that were often difficult to drive, learning patience and honing his race craft with machinery which for so long did not give him a chance to win. While Gasly and Albon's poor form directly led to huge pinchpoints in their respective careers, they could both argue they had been promoted earlier than Red Bull intended and before they were necessarily ready for the challenge. Both have rightly been given a second chance elsewhere. On the flip side Perez's opportunity with Red Bull was overdue and he waited his whole career to drive a car as good as he had in 2023 and, after his good start, he squandered it.\nThe expectations\n\nMuch like Valtteri Bottas with Hamilton, Perez expected (or hoped to) take the fight to Verstappen in 2023. Instead, we had one of the dullest and one-sided F1 championships in history, which perhaps colours some of what has been written here. Verstappen likely would have won the championship before the Abu Dhabi finale but Perez had the car, and, importantly, has the talent, to have at least made the title fight into a spectacle of some kind.\n\nEven before his move to Red Bull for 2021, Perez had made a name for himself as one of F1's most talented, in terms of race craft and tyre management. His form has been up and down in the three seasons since, but at the start of the year there was a sense that Perez simply needed to get some momentum going and accumulate results -- in other words, keep himself in the hunt, like Nico Rosberg did successfully in 2016 versus Hamilton.\n\nLuckily for Perez, one of the biggest believers in his talent is Red Bull, which was evidenced by how strongly they stuck by him through the lowest moments of 2023. On his day he remains one of the better drivers on F1's grid, something he demonstrated in a superb, and fair, wheel to wheel duel with Fernando Alonso during the Brazilian Grand Prix. But that fight wasn't always there -- he meekly surrendered the win to Verstappen in Miami and let over-eagerness get the better of him when a strong result was on the table at his home race in Mexico.\n\nHow did the rest look?\n\nWe hadn't forgotten about the other half of the grid -- here's a rundown of where we felt the remaining drivers sat after this season.\n\n11. Sergio Perez - See above.\n\n12. Pierre Gasly - A decent first year for Alpine capped with a podium at the Dutch Grand Prix, but found himself stuck in the midfield with the car he had. Gasly's qualifying form against Esteban Ocon puts him just ahead of his teammate.\n\n13. Esteban Ocon - Like Gasly, Ocon's high point was a podium (in Monaco) but ultimately he and the team were unable to replicate some of the high points of previous seasons in what was another tumultuous year behind the scenes.\n\n14. Daniel Ricciardo - After a popular return with AlphaTauri he was unlucky to break his hand at Zandvoort just when he was building momentum. His high point was a superb seventh position finish in Mexico, but he just didn't drive enough races to feature higher.\n\n15. Liam Lawson - The Kiwi impressed as Ricciardo's stand-in and the biggest compliment you can pay to his five-race stint in the car is that he never looked out of place, even at the wet Dutch GP, where he replaced Ricciardo before qualifying. He was unlucky not to be given a full-time race seat and should be on the radar of several teams for 2025.\n\n16. Nico Hulkenberg - Showed no signs of rust after three years away and impressed, when he could, in the sluggish and temperamental Haas car. He comfortably out-qualified teammate Kevin Magnussen across the year.\n\n17. Valtteri Bottas - We know what Bottas can do on a good day but Alfa Romeo's car just wasn't competitive enough for him to show it, finishing the year with just a handful of points to his name.\n\n18. Zhou Guanyu - After a patchy rookie season, Zhou did not kick on in his sophomore season as many would have hoped. He retained his seat for 2024 but will need to produce more consistently to remain beyond that.\n\n19. Lance Stroll - Deserves credit for how he came back from a preseason training injury without missing a race, but was utterly demolished by Fernando Alonso in what was a competitive car for significant chunks of the year. He scored zero podiums to the Spaniard's eight and should have scored a lot more points. Stroll continues to look like the most glaring weakness of the team owned by his father.\n\n20. Kevin Magnussen - Fairly anonymous for most of the year and found himself out-performed by a teammate returning after three years out. Coming off the back of his standout 2022 campaign his season was disappointing.\n\n21. Nyck De Vries - Whether you agreed with his sacking or not, in 11 races De Vries failed to convince Red Bull he had been the right guy to sign for AlphaTauri. Given how his season ended it's impossible to put him anywhere but at the rear end of this list.\n\n22. Logan Sargeant - Was lucky to retain his seat for 2024 and, unlike De Vries, was given a whole season and still did not show signs of major improvement. The Floridian did not out-qualify teammate Alex Albon a single time. Williams pointed to Sargeant's gutsier displays later in the year as a reason for keeping him but he was also lucky by the lack of realistic options at the team's disposal. He is another under huge pressure to perform next year.",

        "articleBody": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- If there was any doubt before, there isn't now -- Pep Guardiola's Manchester City have earned their place among the greatest club sides in history.\n\nWinning the Club World Cup on Friday was more a box-ticking exercise than a genuine test of their ability, but the champions of England and Europe are now, officially, champions of the world. They did it with a largely comfortable 4-0 win over Fluminense, who were a goal down inside the first minute and never looked poised to come back.\n\nGuardiola spoke before the game about \"closing the circle\" and winning the only piece of available silverware not already on his résumé with Manchester City. They did that, and it was done with the calm dominance that has been a hallmark of the other 13 major trophies Guardiola has won since arriving at City in 2016. Fluminense, the best team in South America, managed just two shots on target as City became the first English side to win five trophies in a calendar year.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Ranking the faves in all of Europe's competitions\n\n\"It's a beautiful, beautiful day,\" Guardiola said. \"I'm very pleased and I would like to say we had the feeling we would close the chapter, we won all the titles, there's nothing else to win. I have a feeling the job is done, it is over.\n\n\"When I close the chapter, it's for eight years of incredible work behind the scenes. I have a feeling we have done it. Now we buy another book and start to write it again. The last eight years, it's over.\"\n\nArguments about the relative merits of football teams are destined never to be settled, but Guardiola's City deserve to be part of the conversation.\n\nThere's Arrigo Sacchi's great Milan side and the Liverpool team of the 1970s and 1980s, which won the European Cup four times. There's also Real Madrid's back-to-back-to-back Champions League winners and Sir Alex Ferguson's masterful Manchester United teams of the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nGuardiola has another contender with his Barcelona team featuring prime Lionel Messi -- but City's achievements under the Catalan coach stack up against them all.\n\nThis is supposedly English football's era of strength with a multibillion-pound broadcast deal fuelling title ambitions of six or seven clubs every year, but Man City have continued to thwart their best competitors in the Premier League. In Guardiola's seven-and-a-half years, they've won the Premier League five times, as well as two FA Cups, four League Cups, the Champions League, the Super Cup and now the Club World Cup. City also won a domestic treble in 2019 and replicated United's 1999 treble of the Premier League title, FA Cup and Champions League last season.\n\nHaving won the title in each of the last three years, Man City could win a record fourth in a row this season and, although it hasn't been the smoothest of starts to their campaign, you would never bet against them.\n\n\"In Barcelona, 25 years later people talk about great teams, 25 years later,\" Guardiola said. \"That means they're really good. I don't know what's going to happen at City in the next 15, 20, 25 years -- maybe we will be considered one of the best teams in history.\n\n\"The consistency year by year, game by game, title by title, semifinals, finals, always there fighting for all the titles, it's unbelievable.\"\n\nThere are, of course, questions to answer. Not least among them are the 115 charges levelled at City by the Premier League, with allegations that the club breached financial fair play rules between 2009 and 2018. But, based purely on what has happened on the pitch, Guardiola's City have been remarkable.\n\nFluminense, fortunate to get past Al Ahly in their semifinal, were never likely to put up much of a fight, and any hope of causing a shock was over when Julián Álvarez scored the fastest goal in Club World Cup final history after 40 seconds.\n\nGuardiola tried to talk up the Brazilian side's qualities before kickoff -- maybe an attempt to keep his players focused as much as anything else -- but there's a clear gap between the biggest European clubs and the rest of the world, which has meant the reigning Champions League winner has lifted this trophy in 15 of the last 16 years.\n\nAn own goal from Nino after 27 minutes made it 2-0 to end the game as a contest. From there the only question was how many would City score. Phil Foden got a third and Alvarez a fourth late on, but the fireworks from David Guetta's elaborate pre-match show with Bebe Rexha were never needed as City won a fifth trophy in 2023.\n\nThe one downside was an injury to Rodri in the second half after a reckless challenge from Alexsander. It was a good sign that, after hobbling off, Rodri was still able to dance around during the presentation -- City will need him if there is going to be more success this season.\n\nGuardiola has 18 months left on his contract and still there's time to add more medals before he walks away. The hard work, though, has already been done: City's place among the best ever is secured.",

Ashburn said it would cost a school $572 million to withdraw from the conference. The lawsuit also accuses the ACC of breach of contract and violation of public policy.\n\nFlorida State is looking for a way out of the conference it has been a member of since 1992 because it believes the ACC is locked into an undervalued and unusually lengthy media rights deal with ESPN that runs through 2036.

        "articleBody": "If Christian McCaffrey fails to win the NFL's Most Valuable Player award this season, there will never be a running back to win the league's most prestigious individual honor again.\n\nThough the award is supposed to recognize the league's best player, or the most impactful playmaker, the voters have made the MVP a quarterback-only honor that routinely goes to the most prolific passer or the QB of the NFL's top team.\n\nIn the 21st century, there have been just four non-quarterback MVP winners, with top runners Marshall Faulk (2000), Shaun Alexander (2005), LaDainian Tomlinson (2006) and Adrian Peterson (2012) claiming the award.\n\nAs the centerpieces of their respective offenses, all of them carried the hopes and dreams of the franchise on their backs. The heavy workloads and jaw-dropping production made it easy to hand them the hardware in a league that continued to skew toward a three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust approach.\n\nThe NFL's recent shift toward a pass-centric focus has made the game strictly about passers, pass-catchers and pass-rushers. The heralded playmakers outside of those groups must impact the passing game, or the football world dismisses their contributions.\n\nFor instance, Derrick Henry has a pair of NFL rushing crowns and a 2,000-yard season on his résumé despite playing with middling quarterbacks, but he has never finished higher than ninth in the MVP race. Though his gold jacket-level production should have warranted more consideration for the league's top honor, particularly with the Titans capturing the division crown in 2020 due to his efforts as a one-man show, Henry's performance barely registered a blip on the radar.\n\nAs the league leader in rushing yards and touchdowns, McCaffrey certainly has a case for the award, particularly in a season without a prolific passer. Brock Purdy, Lamar Jackson and Dak Prescott are enjoying solid campaigns, but it is unlikely they will surpass the 5,000-yard mark or the 40-touchdown threshold associated with gold-standard performance at the position.\n\nMeanwhile, McCaffrey is the straw that stirs the drink for the most dynamic offense in football. As an RB1/WR2 with explosive skills as a multipurpose threat, the seventh-year pro is deployed like the \"Queen\" on the chessboard by Kyle Shanahan. The offensive wizard moves CMC around the formation to create and exploit mismatches while opening up the field for a cast of playmakers with take-over-the-game potential.\n\nWhile Deebo Samuel, George Kittle and Brandon Aiyuk are blue-chip players with elite skills, McCaffrey is the focal point of defensive game plans designed to slow down the 49ers' offensive juggernaut. He attracts plus-one boxes when aligned in the backfield and bracket coverage when positioned in the slot or out wide as a quasi-receiver.\n\nThe creative shuffling of the All-Pro playmaker has given opponents fits since his arrival. McCaffrey has scored a scrimmage touchdown in 23 of his 25 games with the 49ers, including 20 total touchdowns this season. The veteran has a knack for scoring in various ways as a runner-receiver with an elite burst and wiggle.\n\nHowever, McCaffrey's impact extends beyond his prolific point-scoring ability as he leads the NFL in rush yards (1,292), scrimmage yards (1,801), scrimmage touchdowns (20), yards after contact (596), receiving yards for a running back (509), 10-plus yard runs (38) and rushing first downs (74).\n\nThose numbers are MVP-caliber on their merit, but look at his impact on the 49ers since his arrival in 2021. The 49ers sport a 21-3 overall record with CMC as a starter, including an 11-3 mark this season. He has transformed the offense into an unstoppable force with his transcendent talents creating headaches for defensive coordinators around the league. In addition, he has helped the 49ers break in a late-round quarterback as an unlikely starter.\n\nThat is not a slight to Purdy's success as San Francisco's QB1. The second-year pro has killed it since taking over as the starter in the middle of the 2021 season. Purdy has ascended from his role as a game manager to thrive as a game changer, but McCaffrey's dominance as a multi-faceted playmaker has assisted his efforts.\n\nFrom the attention he commands as the NFL's leading rusher to his ability to flourish as a pass-catcher on swings, screens and option routes, McCaffrey tips the scales in the 49ers' favor with his presence. By definition, that is precisely what is expected of MVPs in a game in which the star's performance routinely determines outcomes.\n\nWhile the voters will entertain Purdy, Jackson and Prescott as viable MVPs, the numbers and film suggest that McCaffrey should be a landslide winner in the NFL's top honor race.",

        "articleBody": "Next month, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic will interview Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAD). After two days of behind-closed-doors interviews, the subcommittee will schedule a public hearing to take his sworn testimony.\n\nFauci’s testimony will doubtless cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from masking to vaccine mandates. But rest assured that congressional investigators will zero in on Fauci’s knowledge of, and response to, crucial information concerning the origins of the pandemic in China.\n\nTo secure a fully transparent accounting, House and Senate investigators are also pressing the Administration to release key details about what Fauci and his colleagues knew about the origin of the pandemic, and when they knew it. But Biden administration officials continue to stall the release of relevant information, offering transparently lame excuses, to block congressional access and public disclosure of unredacted documents.\n\nTeam Biden’s persistent lack of transparency on COVID-19 has been nothing short of scandalous. Here is the latest proof:\n\nExhibit A: Blocking Document Disclosure. In October 2017, well before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Ping Chen, an NIAID official, visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology and prepared a trip report for top NIAID officials.\n\n>>> The Need for Uncensored Data and Debate on COVID Restrictions\n\nSens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ron Johnson(R-Wisc.) learned of the trip four years later and, in August 2021, wrote HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and acting NIH Director Lawrence Tabak asking them to release unredacted records of Chen’s visit to Wuhan. In response, HHS instead provided a heavily redacted copy of Chen’s report, plus redacted emails.\n\nIn a subsequent briefing for Senate staff, Dr. Melanie Egorin, HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation, said the redactions were for “security” reasons. But that excuse was clearly incorrect because, as the senators noted, HHS had already conceded that national security was not at issue and the documents themselves were unclassified. As Sen. Johnson remarked, “Given HHS’s extensive redactions of unclassified documents, I can only assume that the true nature of HHS’s ‘security’ interest is to protect itself from additional embarrassment over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nSen. Johnson has since renewed his request to interview Dr. Chen and asked for a complete and unredacted copy of her report and related documents. Thus far, no response.\n\nExhibit B: Flaunting Federal Records Rules. On June 11, 2021, Johnson, Paul and three other Senate colleagues sent Secretary Becerra a letter requesting documents relating to NIH officials’ response to the pandemic’s origins. The senators had learned that Dr. David Morens, senior scientific adviser to Dr. Fauci, had emailed Dr. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, on January 9, 2020, asking Daszak for any “inside info” on the novel coronavirus. Daszak replied that NIAID had been funding coronavirus research for “the past five years” and taxpayer monies had been funneled to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. For several years, Daszak’s controversial firm had indeed gotten substantial NIAID funding; and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which had been a center of China’s coronavirus research, had been a subcontractor of the EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nAccording to Sen. Johnson’s account, upon receipt of the June 2021 letter, Morens told Daszak and a small group of his colleagues that he had retained “very few” documents on these “matters.” Morens cautioned the group to correspond with him outside of official channels at his Gmail address, adding, “I have tried to make sure I have retained no documents that might lead other members of ASTMH to be approached for similar document production.” (ASTMH stands for the “American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,” Morens’ little group).\n\nAmong those receiving this Gmail warning were three prominent virologists, Dr. Kristian Andersen, Dr. Robert Garry and Dr. Edward Holmes, who had published a prominent 2020 article in Nature Medicine arguing that a COVID lab origin was “improbable.” That article was a sharp and rapid reversal of their original assessment of an “unnatural” origin of the coronavirus.\n\nWhen Sen. Johnson learned in August of 2023 that Morens was apparently using his personal Gmail in communications concerning COVID origins, he wrote Christi Grimm, HHS Inspector General, asking her to investigate the apparent attempt to use to evade requests for public information under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nJohnson also told Grimm that an unnamed whistleblower claimed that NIH officials may have destroyed sensitive federal records related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a serious criminal offense with severe penalties. For their part, NIH officials claimed they conducted an internal investigation of that allegation, and determined to their own satisfaction that the charge was without merit. Satisfied that there was nothing more to it, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the agency charged with the preservation of official records, also dropped its inquiry into the matter.\n\nRemarkably, Grimm rejected Johnson’s request for a Senate staff briefing on the controversy, claiming that it is standard practice to “neither confirm nor deny” the existence of ongoing investigations. Johnson nonetheless renewed his request that Grimm investigate Morens’ use of Gmail to conduct agency business, the alleged NIH destruction of official agency records, and any effort by Morens or and others to evade the Freedom of Information Act. But she denied the request once again.\n\n>>> Enough Is Enough: COVID Oversight Requires Tougher Congressional Action\n\nIn a November 15, 2023 letter to Secretary Becerra, recounting the foregoing facts, Senator Johnson tried again:\n\nClosing In. Senator Johnson and his colleagues do not have subpoena power. As he told this writer, “I am attempting to convince Chairman Blumenthal to issue subpoenas to the non-responsive agencies. If that proves unsuccessful, you can rest assured that, if I become Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, subpoenas will be issued and enforced.” \n\nHouse Republicans do, however, have subpoena power. When Dr. Fauci testifies early next year before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, congressional investigators should probe his recollections concerning Dr. Chen’s report and Dr. Morens’ intriguing communications.\n\nDuring his November 2022 deposition in the federal case of Missouri vs Biden, Fauci said he could not recall 174 times in response to questions related to the COVID pandemic. House investigators will thus have an excellent opportunity to refresh his memory on what he learned about the origins of the deadly disease, when he learned it, and how he responded.",

        "articleBody": "Are you better off than you were four years ago? President Ronald Reagan famously asked Americans that question in a debate with President Jimmy Carter, and Americans overwhelmingly answered “NO!” If the same question were asked today, you’d get the same response, because President Joe Biden’s policies have devastated Americans’ finances.\n\nFrom his first hours in office, Biden has waged a relentless war against American energy, canceling pipelines, leases, and permits, while throwing up countless regulatory barriers. That has greatly increased the cost of energy, which has increased costs throughout the economy. But Biden’s spending agenda has been just as harmful, perhaps more so.\n\nIf Biden had simply done nothing upon taking office and allowed the one-time emergency spending from COVID to expire, the budget would be balanced by now. Instead, he has constantly pushed for more spending and has institutionalized multi-trillion-dollar annual deficits.\n\nTo pay for this runaway spending spree, the Federal Reserve created trillions of dollars out of nothing, which quickly devalued the currency in less than three years as inflation hit 40-year-highs. So, though many Americans earn more today, their larger paychecks buy them less. For 28 of the last 32 months, inflation has outpaced the growth of average weekly earnings.\n\n>>> Biden Blames Businesses for Inflation, but His Own Numbers Refute Him\n\nThis is devastating for American families. Compared to when Biden took office, they’re paying 20 percent more for food and 38 percent more for gasoline. It also costs 28 percent more to keep your home warm this winter. And these are the Biden administration’s own figures. People are demonstrably poorer.\n\nUnable to make ends meet, a record number of Americans have resorted to getting second or third jobs. That’s also making the employment statistics look better than they are by increasing the number of payrolls without increasing the number of people employed. But even this isn’t enough for many Americans, who have depleted their savings and gone deeply into debt to keep the lights on.\n\nCredit-card debt is at a record $1.1 trillion, and 25 percent of Americans haven’t paid off the debt they acquired from Christmas shopping—in 2022.\n\nTo bring down the stratospheric inflation rates it helped cause, the Fed has embarked on a belated series of interest rate increases which has imposed significantly higher borrowing costs on American families and businesses alike.\n\nThat means not only are people in a record amount of credit-card debt, but the interest rates on those credit cards are at a record high.\n\nThis combination of both prices and interest rates rising has completely frozen the housing market. The monthly mortgage payment on a median price home has doubled under the Biden Administration. It costs a family an extra $12,000 per year for the same house. Unless your income has doubled in less than three years, a house probably isn’t affordable for you. This is nothing short of a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nFor the typical American family, the combination of falling real earnings and higher borrowing costs has been equivalent to losing $6,800 in annual income.\n\nBut official inflation metrics don’t account for many regulatory costs that are imposed by the government, and those costs have exploded under Biden even faster than they did under President Barack Obama.\n\n>>> Why Inflation Hits Poor Americans Hardest\n\nJust two years of regulatory rulemaking under Biden have cost the average American household about $9,600, compared to about $8,300 for the same time under Obama. Conversely, regulatory costs went down $11,000 for the average American household over the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency.\n\nThat means on the regulatory front alone, just two years of Biden have wiped out most of the gains the average household accrued during the previous four years.\n\nClearly, the failed policies of the last three years have hurt Americans, and it is particularly bitter that these have all been self-inflicted wounds. Fortunately, the terrible effects of these policies will be reversed if we simply reverse the policies themselves.\n\nWhat, precisely, does that look like? First and foremost, Congress and the White House need to cut federal spending. That will help reduce both inflation and interest rates, bringing much needed relief to American families.\n\nSecond, the next president needs to roll back the burdensome overregulation of the Biden administration, which will further reduce costs while encouraging economic growth, job creation, and real wage growth. Ending the Biden Administration’s war on American energy will have the exact same effects.\n\nAmerica’s economic decline is not foreordained. It can be reversed if our leaders have the political will to do it. Americans should keep in mind that Biden clearly has no intention of reversing our decline, but accelerating it.",

        "articleBody": "This seems like it should be bigger news. Well, should be bigger if only the press wasn’t already sweating how weak, old, and mentally impaired Biden is, and this paints another thick layer of shriveled impotency on the husk.\n\nTheir squeamishness to embrace acknowledge the major suckage that is their man in an election year also probably explains why it took so long to break this news to begin with. It supposedly happened last month.\n\n    Chinese President Xi Jinping bluntly told President Joe Biden during their recent summit in San Francisco that Beijing will reunify Taiwan with mainland China but that the timing has not yet been decided, according to three current and former U.S. officials.\n\n    Xi told Biden in a group meeting attended by a dozen American and Chinese officials that China’s preference is to take Taiwan peacefully, not by force, the officials said.\n\nWe’d rather you just gave it to us, instead of helping them make it messy.\n\nEXCUSE ME, WHUT\n\nThat’s what rumor has it the man said to the alleged President of the United States.\n\nI’m sorry, ladies and germs – whatever your opinion of Donald Trump, I cannot concieve of this happening in his presence, and sure as hell not while on American soil.\n\nHoly SMOKES – can you imagine the fireworks if anyone dared?\n\nBut we don’t have someone like that – we have this blithering vegetable.\n\nWhen Xi mentioned “Taiwan” POTATUS probably rambled into a story about “tying one on” with Nelson Mandela on an Amtrack or something.\n\nGod almighty. And Biden wants to come off as the rational one when he’s barely functional less mind lucid.\n\n    …During the summit in San Francisco, Xi expressed concerns about the candidates running for president of Taiwan in next month’s election, according to U.S. officials. Xi also noted the influence that the U.S. has on Taiwan, they said.\n\n    When Biden asked that China respect Taiwan’s electoral process, Xi responded by saying that peace is “all well and good” but that China needs to eventually move toward a resolution, one U.S. official said.\n\n    Biden’s meeting with Xi, their first in a year, took American officials months to secure after relations between Washington and Beijing reached a low point in February after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon. The White House hoped the meeting would ease tensions, and afterward Biden stressed the need to avoid conflict.\n\n    “We’re in a competitive relationship, China and the United States, but my responsibility is to make this rational and manageable, so it doesn’t result in conflict,” Biden said. “That’s what I’m all about. That’s what this is about.”\n\n“You can count on us,” POTATUS told the assembled APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation) heads and representatives at the big meeting Gavin Newsom hosed out San Francisco for.\n\n    ‘You can count on the US’, Biden tells APEC, despite trade deal stumbles\n\n    President Joe Biden highlighted strong US ties to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum economies on Thursday (Nov 16) and called on CEOs there to treat workers fairly, even as a regional trade deal stumbled over workers’ rights.\n\n    Before a working lunch and speech to heads of the 21-member APEC governments at their annual summit, Biden spoke to an audience of CEOs, touting investments by US companies in the region including Amazon, Delta Air Lines, PepsiCo, Apple and Boeing.\n\nWho’s your buddy, who’s your pal?\n\n    …APEC members have been closely watching developments between the US and China, the world’s two largest economies and strategic rivals, concerned that ever more intense competition could upset global trade and security.\n\n    In his speech, Biden said a stable relationship between the US and China was good for the world.\n\n    He said the United States was committed to the Asia-Pacific and that he had told Xi the US was engaged in the region because it was “a Pacific nation”. Biden said the United States was not decoupling its economy from China, but “de-risking and diversifying.”\n\n    “We will be firm, standing up for our values and our interests,” he said. “We’re gonna continue our commitment to diplomacy, to avoid surprises, prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nFirm, huh? Like a rock, or like pudding after it’s been in the fridge for a couple of hours?\n\nI vote “pudding,” because there’s not a single word in any of the articles about Xi’s speakly “bluntly” to indicate he got “bluntly” back from Biden. In fact, there’s NOTHING related to ANY response from POTATUS, period.\n\nIsn’t that curious? There’s just a quote from some anon about Xi talking the same old smack.\n\n    …“His language was no different than what he has always said. He is always tough on Taiwan. He’s always had a tough line,” said a U.S. official with knowledge of the conversation.\n\nWith no smack back.\n\nI wonder how Taiwan’s feeling right about now?\n\nThey probably have knees about as firm as cold pudding just thinking about it.",

        "title": "Will San Francisco Pass Drug Testing for Welfare Recipients?",
        "authors": "John Sexton",
        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "It’s hard to believe this is even being considered in San Francisco, much less that it has a chance of passing. Back in September Mayor London Breed proposed drug testing the city’s welfare recipients.\n\n    “No more handouts without accountability,” Breed said at a City Hall news conference. “People are not accepting help. Now, it’s time to make sure that we are cutting off resources that continue to allow this behavior.”\n\n    The proposal from the Democratic mayor of this ultra-liberal city reflects the depth of frustration with a fentanyl crisis that has led to record overdoses, turned parts of downtown into open-air drug markets and is correlated with an increase in car break-ins and other property crime.\n\nHere’s how it would work if implemented:\n\n    Under the new proposal, as a condition of eligibility to receive CAAP, people with suspected substance use disorder would be required to participate in substance abuse screenings or treatment programs funded by SFHSA. These treatment programs would include a range of interventions from residential treatment, medical detox, medically-assisted treatment, outpatient options, and abstinence- based treatment.\n\n    Anyone who refuses, or does not successfully engage in treatment, would be cut off from CAAP cash assistance.\n\n    The San Francisco Human Services Agency oversees the CAAP program. Currently, about 5,200 people are receiving cash payments between $100-$700 monthly.\n\nThe proposal was immediately criticized by progressives, including a possible challenger for mayor who is currently chairman of the Board of Supervisors.\n\n    Board President Aaron Peskin, who some believe may run against Breed, said the mayor was “grasping for a political lifeline” and predicted the policy would fail.\n\n    “These are serious times in San Francisco — and we need serious ideas,” he said in a statement.\n\n    “Mayor Breed does not have the ability or the will to organize our many public safety resources … If she can’t find the way to prevent several hundred brazen criminals from selling deadly drugs, how does she think she will find the resources to drug test thousands of welfare recipients?\n\nMayor Breed also got pushback from the users themselves who seemed to be upset the taxpayers were judging them.\n\n    Struggling with an opioid addiction and fleeing successive wildfire evacuations in her native Lake County, Shelly Brown arrived in San Francisco two years ago to find a city awash in aid. She began receiving monthly welfare payments in addition to food and money from local nonprofit organizations…\n\n    “I want to cry just thinking about it,” said Brown, 40, adding that it felt like a personal affront because she had received government assistance since childhood…\n\n    At Civic Center, Amy Brown pulled a cart filled with garbage bags and a sack of children’s toys she was selling. She had recently moved into permanent housing in the Tenderloin after completing treatment at a rehabilitation center for alcohol and drug use following a relapse.\n\n    “Ideally, is it better to be drug free? Yes, of course,” said Brown, 41. “But at the end of the day, it’s our choice to use if we want to use.”\n\nIt absolutely is her choice to use drugs but it’s also the city’s choice and the taxpayer’s choice whether they want to pay for those drugs. And there’s no doubt that is what is happening in many cases. Nearly two years ago I posted this video shot in San Francisco by Michael Shellenberger. Listen to James who explains that he came to San Francisco because all it takes is a phone call to get on city welfare and then he’s free to do drugs on the taxpayers dime.\n\nIt’s not really a surprise that a proposal like this got pushback in San Francisco. What is surprising is that the situation is so dire that people who might previously have been critics are open to trying anything now.\n\n    Despite a series of proposals by Mayor London Breed that have historically harmed communities of color, many Black San Francisco community leaders say they remain supportive of the mayor and her strategy. They said San Francisco is facing a crisis that requires a different hand, even one that would increase policing and punitive measures…\n\n    Del Seymour, a self-described former addict who runs Code Tenderloin and is a community leader there, has not always believed in a tough-on-crime approach, but said he is “willing to try anything.”…\n\n    Although he has spoken against the war on drugs as ineffectual in the past, Seymour supports Breed’s latest proposal to screen welfare recipients for drug use.\n\n    “I wouldn’t have agreed to this a year ago,” he said of the drug-screening ballot measure. “I’m just tired of seeing the misery. I’m tired of seeing the irresponsibility.”\n\nThe proposal will be on the March ballot. So does this actually have a chance of passing in one of America’s bluest cities? A recent suggests it has strong support from likely voters.\n\n    According to a poll conducted last month, 66% of likely March voters support the measure—the highest of any ballot measure polled.\n\n  “Voters are very concerned right now about crime and safety issues, the same with concern we’re seeing for open-air drug use and concerns about fentanyl addiction,” said Ruth Bernstein of EMC Research, which polled 500 likely voters in mid-November on their views of three measures slated for the March 2024 ballot.\n\nBut it’s not a done deal yet. The board which runs the SF Democratic Party is urging people to vote no on the measure. Allegedly they are concerned about taking money from needy people but in this case the only people who might lose money are addicts who are spending the money on drugs. You start to get the impression that progressives in San Francisco are a little bit worried some of these proposals might pass and, even worse, some of them might work.",

        "articleBody": "From the honky-tonks of Nashville to the rock ‘n’ roll venues of Memphis, the former home of Elvis has long been known for its music credentials – but it’s not only about the big-hitters, with a whole host of lesser-known spots to explore in Tennessee too. We’ve rounded up the best urban adventures to be had across the state, from Nashville to Knoxville, Memphis to Maryville.\n\nNashville\n\nWith a huge mix of recording studios, live-music venues and neon-lit honky-tonks, it’s easy to see what gave Nashville its ‘Music City’ reputation. Any trip here should include a visit to the Country Music Hall of Fame – home of RCA Studio B, where Elvis Presley, Dolly Parton and many more made their mark – and the Ryman Auditorium, the “Mother Church of Country Music”.  For history, the Bell Meade plantation is well worth a visit, as is the tree-lined Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, set beneath the impressive State Capitol building. The city’s culinary scene is also one of its biggest draws, offering everything from James Beard-awarded restaurants to laid-back spots serving spicy ‘hot chicken’, fuelled by its handful of whisky distilleries.\nMemphis\n\nThe birthplace of blues and rock ‘n’ roll, Memphis isn’t short on music-bragging rights. Take a tour of Graceland to see the former home of the “king of rock ‘n’ roll” and pay a visit to Sun Studio to stand on the spot where he first recorded. Beale Street is the beating heart of the city’s live music scene with its slew of bars and clubs, and there’s plenty in the way of good food too – the city is famous for its barbecue joints, including Charlie Vergo’s Rendezvous, opened in 1948. Beyond the music scene, you can hop on a paddlewheel boat to explore the Mississippi River, or learn more about the region’s history at the National Civil Rights Museum. Built on the site where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, the museum gives a powerful, moving glimpse into the city’s ties to the movement.\n\nKnoxville\n\nThe state’s third-largest city, Knoxville might sit in the shadows of its bigger siblings, but that’s all part of the charm. The city’s Urban Wilderness has 1,000 acres of forest, including more than 50 miles of hiking and biking trails, a handful of swimmable lakes and a zip-line that takes you soaring 60 feet over the trees. Back in the centre, the State Botanical Garden at the University of Tennessee is well worth a wander, while the pedestrian-friendly Market Square offers shops, restaurants, cafes and a farmers’ market, and hosts regular live music performances. Also well worth a visit is Blount Mansion – the ‘birthplace of Tennessee’ and the former home of William Blount, one of the signatories of the US constitution.\n\nChattanooga\n\nLocated in south-eastern Tennessee, this off-the-beaten-track mountain town is a hotspot for families with its slew of child-friendly attractions, from the Tennessee Aquarium to Chattanooga Zoo. There’s plenty to lure adults too; head to the Lookout Mountain for panoramic views over the surrounding valley, and duck underground to explore Ruby Falls – a series of waterfalls that cascade down illuminated caves. While you’re here, pay a visit to Rock City Gardens, where you can cross a 180 ft-high suspension bridge amid ancient rock formations, and climb aboard the Incline Railway funicular to see it from another perspective. Downtown, the Chattanooga Choo Choo offers restaurants, shops, a festive ‘Winter Wonderland’ and various other draws on a complex that was once a train station. There’s a vibrant arts, food and live music scene across the city too – what else would we expect from Tennessee?\n\nMaryville\n\nJust south of Knoxville, Maryville has its own unique set of lures – not least its proximity to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It’s all about small-town charm here, with quaint boutiques, breweries and Southern comfort-food restaurants scattered across its historic downtown area, first settled in the 19th century. There are several sites worth checking out; don’t miss Maryville College, the Clayton Center for the Arts and the Sam Houston Historic Schoolhouse, which gives a glimpse into school life in the early days of the United States.",

        "articleBody": "The government is planning to buy sugar directly from local farmers in a bid to stabilize declining farm-gate prices, although the retail prices of sugar in Metro Manila remain high.\n\nSugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chief Pablo Luis Azcona said the government was “seriously thinking about or already planning” to buy locally produced sugar at a higher price and sell the same “at a better retail price.”\n\n“This way, we will give the farmers a better farm-gate [price]. At the same time, the consumers and the farmers as well will get a better retail price,” Azcona said in a virtual interview on Friday.\n\nBut, Azcona said, there were no plans to import more sugar as the country has enough supply.\n\n“Based on the current demand figures, there is no apparent need to import any sugar,” he said, adding that authorities have observed a significant spread between the farm-gate price and the retail price of sugar, suggesting manipulation somewhere along the supply chain.\n\nSugar industry leaders have attributed the drop in farm-gate prices to P2,500 per bag and below an expected P3,000 per bag to an oversupply of imported sugar.\nPrices still high\n\nBut Azcona dismissed the claim, saying, “if there is really an oversupply of sugar, its retail prices should have dropped also.”\n\nAt the same time, Azcona said producers and traders who have volunteered to provide the sugar to fill a US sugar quota allocation granted to the Philippines, so he wrote to the US Department of Agriculture to request that the Philippines be included in its sugar quota.\n\nBut based on the SRA’s monitoring as of Dec. 3, sugar prices declined by 23.48 percent to P2,486.28 per 50-kilo bag from P3,249.16 per 50-kilo bag in the same period a year ago.\n\nEarlier, the SRA said the ideal farm-gate price of sugar should be around P3,000 per 50-kilo bag to allow retailers to sell refined sugar at P85 per kilogram. However, selling prices of sugar in Metro Manila markets remain high. According to the Department of Agriculture’s price monitoring, refined sugar is sold from as low as P75 per kg to as high as P100 per kg as of Friday.\n\nThe prevailing retail price is almost similar to the P95 per kg level recorded in the same period last year.\nGov’t intervention\n\nThe Sugar Council, comprising of three industry federations that produce more than half of national sugar output, on Tuesday reiterated their call for timely government intervention amid the drop in sugar prices.\n\nNegros Occidental Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson believed the government should put on hold any sugar importation in the future.\n\n“I hope the downward trend in (millgate sugar) prices stops and starts to go up. I’m afraid many small farmers will be in the red if the prices continue to go down,” he said.\n\nLacson pointed out that the cost of sugar production has increased with the rise in the costs of fertilizer, labor and fuel.\n\n“Everything is more expensive now, even labor cost,” he said.\n\nConcerned government agencies are fleshing out the mechanics of the planned procurement. Azcona said the agency will serve as a conduit since the law prohibits the SRA from engaging in marketing and determining sugar pricing.",

        "articleBody": "The Smart Prepaid Philippine Tourist eSIM makes it simpler to stay connected, whenever, wherever. Here’s how.\n\nChristmas really is the most wonderful time of the year in the Philippines. It’s a special occasion that brings people together, and our homes and streets are all decorated to ring in the holiday season. We also get plenty of visitors who want to see the Philippines all lit up with Christmas lights and holiday cheer. After all, Christmas is one of the biggest holidays we celebrate here!\n\nIf you’re visiting the Philippines this holiday season and are planning to stay for a little while, investing in a good SIM or mobile network would really come in handy. Whether you’re making the trip to visit relatives and reconnect with loved ones or seeing the sights, it’s good to have a SIM you can use for making calls, texts, and getting data to use the Internet on your phone when you’re on the go.\n\nBefore, you would have to open the back of your phone to swap SIM cards when you visit another country, but now you can use eSIMs, which are way more convenient to get and use. If your device is eSIM-compatible, you can use an eSIM to activate a cellular plan without buying a physical SIM card.\n\nHaving an eSIM is useful when traveling, but depending on where you get the eSIM, it can have limitations. For example, some eSIMs sold in travel stores only offer data connectivity that you can use in the Philippines, but don’t cover services for calls and texts. Postpaid plans are just not practical if you’re only visiting the country and roaming rates are more expensive compared to availing data offers and packages from a local network provider in the Philippines. Therefore, so having a local eSIM that can cover data and calls and texts would be the most practical option.\n\nThe Smart Prepaid Philippine Tourist eSIM offers an affordable solution to your connectivity needs. This Prepaid eSIM has the same preload value as regular Smart Prepaid SIMs with up to 21 GB data for only PHP99. With it, you can enjoy Smart Prepaid’s offers and local services like data, calls, and texts, and find the right offer or data bundle that suits the duration of your trip. Whether you’re making calls and texts to plan meet-ups with friends and family, or using data to check Google Maps for the next place to visit for your sightseeing itinerary, you can do it all with a Prepaid eSIM powered by the country’s best mobile network as recognized by global analytics firm Ookla.\n\nThe Smart Prepaid Philippine Tourist eSIM is easy to avail and use. You can purchase the eSIM on the Smart Online Store and instantly activate the QR code that will be sent to your verified email. Depending on your device, you can also add multiple eSIM profiles and have up to two mobile numbers at a time if needed. You can also get the eSIM from Smart booths in international airports in the Philippines. The Smart booths also accept credit card payments.\n\nAside from the Smart Prepaid Philippine Tourist eSIM, you can also avail of Smart’s Unli 5G + Non-Stop Data. Whether you’re planning to stay for just a week or a whole month, Smart’s latest offer provides you with Unlimited 5G data and Non-Stop Data for non-5G areas for 7 days for only Php299 (or ~$5-6) or 30 days for only Php999 (~$17-18), depending on which data promo you get you get. The Smart Unli 5G + Non-Stop Data is also available at Smart booths where cash and cards are accepted.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Smart Prepaid Philippine Tourist eSIM and how to purchase and activate it, you can visit their official website. The eSIM is available via the Smart Online Store, at Smart booths at international airports in the Philippines, Smart-operated e-Hubs, Smart Flagship Stores on Lazada and Shopee, and at selected Smart device retailers nationwide",

        "title": "GOTY: Kotaku's Top 12 Games Of 2023, Ranked",
        "authors": "Alyssa Mercante",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "As we’ve all heard countless times throughout these last 12 months, 2023 has been a very interesting year in gaming. There were an exorbitant amount of layoffs, companies gobbling up other companies like corporate Pac-Man, and leaks galore. But despite the obvious problems within our industry that 2023 unmasked, it was a massive year when it came to the sheer quantity and quality of games on offer.\n\nWhen it came time to start deliberating on Kotaku’s Game of the Year (GOTY) list, I was understandably nervous. There were so many damn games that the initial list was daunting, and the math involved to narrow everything down was a harsh reminder that I am, indeed, very bad with numbers. I double- and triple-checked it all, I sent kind-but-firm reminders to Kotaku staff to get their votes in, and after a few weeks, the list was born. \n\nIs this year’s list surprising? No, not really. Blockbuster games were dropping all throughout the year, from the Resident Evil 4 Remake in March, to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in April, Tears of the Kingdom in May, and Baldur’s Gate 3 in August. Hell, even Cyberpunk 2077 finally lived up to expectations with its Phantom Liberty expansion and massive patch. So, no, the content of this year’s list will not surprise you—though its order might, and the fact that we expanded the list to 12 rather than last year’s ten.\n\nSo, let’s check out Kotaku’s best games of 2023. I await your arguments in the comments.\n\n12. Resident Evil 4 remake\n\nPart of me feels weird claiming a remake is one of the year’s best games. It’s even weirder for me as I was firmly against the idea of remaking Resident Evil 4. But the Resident Evil 4 remake is special. It’s a game worth playing, even if you have never touched a previous Resident Evil title, including the original RE4 (and all its various ports). It balances tense and challenging combat with slower moments that ratchet up the tension and let you explore its gorgeously detailed and spooky world.\n\nYes, some surprises aren’t that surprising if you’ve played the original game. But Capcom went the extra mile and tweaked areas, encounters, and other moments just enough that as a veteran player, I found myself frequently unsure of what was going to happen next. Most of these changes to gameplay, like making the knife more useful, feel thoughtful and deliberate, not just the result of developers trying to make something old feel new in 2023.\n\nBefore this remake, people would often ask if there was a point to remaking RE4, as it is such a fantastic game already, even 18 years after its release. It didn’t seem like a worthwhile endeavor, especially when there are other entries in the franchise that deserve some love. But after playing the remake, it’s clear that Capcom didn’t simply want to “up res” the old game and resell it (again). Instead, the studio put in the work and time and crafted a standalone horror masterpiece that will go on to be as beloved and well-regarded as the original, even surpassing it in many ways. So I guess I’m glad I was wrong about it.\n\n11. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2\n\nSpider-Man 2 asks the question: what if the original Spider-Man, but bigger, bolder, and better? Insomniac smartly takes the winning formula from the 2018 action-adventure game and adds a few dashes of extra essence, offering an even-more-detailed Manhattan (plus new ways to traverse it), the ability to swap between Peter Parker and Miles Morales with ease, and some new bad guys you’ll have to contend with. From beginning to end, Spider-Man 2 offers an uninterrupted drip of gamer serotonin.\n\nSure, it’s not the kind of game that will be lauded for its ingenuity, nor is it the kind that would have won Game of the Year at this year’s Game Awards when facing titans like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Alan Wake II, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a fantastic experience. Spider-Man 2 is a beautifully polished, well-oiled machine, like a 2024 luxury car that looks, mostly, like the one that came the year before it. Just like that luxury vehicle, it’ll impress you with its shiny exterior and impressive handling, and constantly remind you that it is, in fact, a luxury experience. It’s the kind of game you can effortlessly jump into and mess around in for a few solid hours without breaking a mental or physical sweat, a joyously exuberant and bright game that other superhero titles could only ever hope to be. \n\n10. Dave the Diver\n\nIndie or not, Dave the Diver deserves your attention as one of the year’s best games. The adventure offers an engrossing, surprising, and satisfying gameplay loop you can easily get lost in. With a million copies sold in its first month, it’s fair to say the diving simulator made a real splash (sorry that will be the only one) this year.\n\nDeveloper Mintrocket’s pixel-based adventure is a slippery moray eel to sum up into an elevator pitch but I’ll give it a go. As Dave, you deep-sea dive for fish by day, supplying the ingredients for an ocean-front sushi restaurant that you operate when night rolls around. As the business grows, there’s staff to hire, pints to pour, social media to manage, and new equipment to buy for reaching greater depths. There’s too much to Dave than may be reasonably contained in this blurbm and I haven’t even delved into the seahorse-racing meta yet!\n\nJohn Walker, in his write-up for the site, highlights what makes Dave special, calling it:\n\n    “...a game that will not stop getting bigger, more interesting, and perhaps most importantly, more outright bonkers. Introducing new features like other games introduce loading screens, DTD evolves continuously.”\n\nIt’s precisely that ever-evolving loop that promises to keep me coming back to hang with my Bancho Sushi squad well into 2024. What’s more, with a recent port to the Switch and the announcement of a free DLC collaboration with Dredge, another fishing sim that Kotaku scoped out this year, it’s a great time to dive into Dave. \n\n9. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\nPhantom Liberty is the final chapter in Cyberpunk 2077's comeback story. It’s wild how selling millions of copies of a dumpster fire gives you the time and resources to completely gut and reshape it into something that is beyond merely playable, huh?\n\nThough talk of Cyberpunk 2077's inherent value underneath the launch bugs was, in my opinion, greatly exaggerated, the sweeping systemic changes introduced by the Phantom Liberty expansion show that there was always potential for it to be great. The DLC’s spy thriller narrative feels distinct from the main story, and the 2.0 update brings heaps of replayability to what was once a somewhat unplayable title.\n\nIt’s certainly not an underdog story, as the game sold 25 million copies, but Phantom Liberty is a shining example of what happens when a studio of talented developers is given a second chance to fix what was made under a tight deadline. Cyberpunk 2077 is now a phoenix rising from its self-created ashes, and nothing embodies the roller coaster ride we’ve been on like Phantom Liberty. \n\n8. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nThere sure is a lot of Star Wars in 2023, huh? Too much? Maybe. But if we were making a pile of Star Wars stuff and sorting it all out, at the top of this year’s heap would be Respawn’s amazing sequel, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\n\nMixing Dark Souls-like gameplay with the Star Wars universe sounds good on paper, but there are so many ways this could have gone wrong. The game could have been too hard, too focused on copying the Soulslike-formula, or too obsessed with the most obscure Star Wars lore, leaving non-fans confused. However, Respawn was able to pull it off, delivering an action-packed Star Wars adventure that had enough heart and dramatic moments to stand toe-to-toe with any of the recent films, and even win over some folks who were done with the franchise.\n\nThese days, in an era when it feels like games are getting longer and bigger every year, it’s rare that I end a game and feel sad that there isn’t more. Often, I’m happy to reach the credits and move on after slogging through 100 hours of whatever I was doing. But that wasn’t the case with Survivor. I wanted another planet to explore. More puzzles to solve. More Star Wars lore to poke through. And more enemies to rip apart with my various lightsaber blades in all their wonderful colors.\n\nSure, there might be too much Star Wars in our galaxy these days, but if more of it is as good as this, well, then I’m down for another sequel from Respawn. I mean, come on, the best Star Wars stories always come in trilogies, right?\n\n7. Diablo IV\n\nBlizzard’s latest entry in its long-running action-RPG franchise might not have the perfect endgame or offer the kind of seasonal updates that fans want. But to me, that stuff isn’t as important as the actual main game, which I played all the way through twice this year.\n\nDiablo IV doesn’t change up the franchise’s formula all that much as developer Blizzard knows that Diablo’s gameplay is hard to improve on. However, after fans complained about Diablo 3’s narrative and tone, Blizzard saw an opportunity to craft a sequel that felt more like the gothic and dark original games, and the results are obvious in IV. There are some genuinely great quests throughout this game, and some cutscenes that will stick in my memory for years to come.\n\nAnd yes, in 2023, it is still fun to run through a giant pack of monsters, pop a few big spells and abilities, and watch them all evaporate in a glorious explosion of particles. It’s even better when all the blood and dust have settled and you’ve found a few nice pieces of new loot to pick up out of all the viscera. Diablo IV nails that experience, delivering it over and over and over again and activating a part of our lizard brains that few games can.\n\nYes, the updates and endgame content have been a frustrating roller coaster, but the core game is fantastic, one of the best in 2023, and if Blizzard can nail future updates and expansions, it might end up being a game I put a lot of time into in 2024 and beyond. \n\n6. Super Mario Bros. Wonder\n\nGame enjoyers of a certain vintage (old) will no doubt remember “the boot level” of Super Mario Bros. 3. Most Mario power-ups are available in multiple levels, like the Super Leaf or the Fire Flower. Some are more rare, like the Tanooki and Frog Suits that you only stumble upon every once in a while. But the boot, canonically known as Kuribo’s Shoe, appears in exactly one stage in the entire game: World 5, Level 3.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder feels like the development team said, what if we made every level the boot level? Each individual stage has its own unique gimmick—and often two, thanks to the way the game’s hallmark Wonder Seeds allow for an alternate route to completing the level. You can swim through the sky in rivers of torrential rain, transform into a blob to move effortlessly through bricks of slime, and bounce along a rainbow of musical notes as Piranha Plants vibe to the beat. It is impossible to play this game without a big goofy smile on your face.\n\nAll five of the developers behind the original Super Mario Bros. in 1985 (yes, there were only five of them) were involved in the creation of Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Experiencing their wildly inventive riffs on the genre they created nearly 40 years ago is truly an experience to savor. \n\n5. Armored Core VI\n\nFromSoftware’s latest mech shooter revels in the nitty-gritty details fans of the sci-fi series have championed for years, while streamlining much of the experience and including lessons learned from a decade of critically acclaimed Soulsborne experimentation. The result is a fast-paced action game in a captivating future-scape with deep customization and unforgettable boss fights. Armored Core VI successfully sands off some of the infamously opaque franchise’s rough edges without sacrificing its steely soul.\n\nIt refreshingly dispenses with so much of the ancillary time wasters that tend to pad modern blockbusters, buckling under the weight of absurd budgets and ridiculous sales expectations, whether it benefits them or not. There’s no XP to grind, randomized loot to earn, or lists of junk to collect and craft. There sure as hell isn’t a battle pass. There’s just an arsenal of unlockable gear, a loading bay where you fine-tune your mech’s build, and arcade-style bit-sized missions that crescendo from breezy demolition-fests to brutal showdowns that reward experimentation and the patience to hone your skills.\n\nWhere other games try to be everything to everyone, Armored Core VI’s doesn’t dabble in extraneous nonsense. Dialogue is sparse but meaningful and linear missions capitalize on that short leash to take you on a carefully guided tour through a corporate-sponsored apocalypse. None of these things is revolutionary on its own, but the precision and polish with which they’re executed in the year 2023 is notable and feels exhilarating. Austerity can be liberating, and Armored Core VI is an exercise in cutting through the bullshit with a giant laser sword and looking cool-as-hell while doing it.\n\n4. Street Fighter 6\n\nStreet Fighter 6 is a sublime example of how iteration is at the core of fighting game design. Street Fighter V came out in a rough state, though by the time Capcom ended support for it in 2022, it had come around somewhat. But Capcom didn’t make the same mistake with Street Fighter 6, which has come out the gate swinging.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 excels in its ability to make all its fighters feel whole again. It rounds out each of their movesets with universal mechanics like the Drive Gauge, which puts everyone on an equal offensive and defensive footing. And the World Tour mode expands upon each of their characters in incredibly endearing ways, like letting you fail to thirst-text Ryu, who is technologically illiterate, or revealing that Dhalsim isn’t allowed to play baseball anymore because his stretchy legs are considered an unfair advantage.\n\nNot too long ago, Street Fighter felt like it was losing touch with why fighting games have become such a communal cultural phenomenon. Street Fighter 6 is a reminder that for as complex as they can be, fighting games are for everyone.\n\n3. Baldur’s Gate 3\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3, Larian Studios’ Dungeons & Dragons RPG, is immaculately designed, allowing for forms of expression across character customization, battle tactics, and roleplaying that most games of its scale can’t even dream of. Its cast has quickly become one of the most beloved in the past decade of RPG parties.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 may not have won Kotaku’s Game of the Year (I’m not bitter! Pinky promise!), but it is, perhaps, one of the most important ones on this list. It’s a testament to the passion and talent of the people who made it, and a reminder that when games are given the time and resources to create something this bold and reactive, it gives everyone who plays it an experience that is all their own.\n\nThe video game industry is at a crisis point, with thousands of jobs lost in 2023 alone and more likely to come in the future. Baldur’s Gate 3, despite coming out this year, feels like a relic of a bygone era where games were complete at launch, post-launch updates were substantial and somehow still free, and the player feedback has been heard and applied. Larian has built up so much goodwill in just a few short months since launch that even if it were to stop updating BG3 tomorrow, it would still stand as a symbol of what games can be, and a sad reminder that they rarely make them like this anymore.\n\n2. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\n\nI was wary of Tears of the Kingdom in the weeks leading up to its release. After years and years of stagnation in its signature fantasy series, Nintendo had finally saved Zelda with 2017’s Breath of the Wild, a game that had, in one fell swoop, blown off all the dust that had accumulated on the franchise and given it new, exhilarating life. However, everything Nintendo showed of Tears of the Kingdom prior to its launch left me worried that we were about to get another safe sequel, BotW 1.5, rather than something worthy of the series’ spirit of adventure.\n\nHow wrong I was to worry. Nintendo kept TotK’s biggest surprises mostly under wraps, letting us discover the unnerving vastness of Hyrule’s new subterranean depths for ourselves, as well as just how game-changing its grand new assortment of abilities really are. Sure, ultrahand—the new power that lets hero Link fashion all manner of useful contraptions from the world’s resources—may enable those with real arts-and-crafts aplomb to create some truly amazing things. But the brilliance of Tears of the Kingdom’s design lies in how even players like me, who typically feel intimidated when games force us to be engineers, can fumble our way to our own wonky solutions and, maybe sometimes, even manage to design something pretty cool ourselves.\n\nPart of what made Breath of the Wild so extraordinary was that Hyrule was elevated to the role of central character. Zelda may still be in the game’s title but the core relationship of the game was between Link and the world you explore, a world you really feel as you so rarely feel the world in games—its rough terrain under your feet, its steep cliffs under your climbing, grasping hands. Tears of the Kingdom makes this relationship even deeper as abilities like ultrahand and ascend give you new ways of relating to and interacting with the world, enriching your relationship with the terrain and what it offers you. This relationship, and the ways in which these abilities enhance it, are both deeply meaningful and, in the best and truest sense, genuinely playful, allowing freedom, imagination, and creativity to flourish. Tears of the Kingdom is Nintendo building a masterpiece on top of a masterpiece, demonstrating once again that fresh, innovative ideas can make familiar franchises feel thrillingly new again.\n\n1. Alan Wake II\n\nAlan Wake II rekindled a feeling for me that I once experienced fairly often but that I’ve rarely encountered in big-budget games of late: the feeling of playing something truly, wholly original. That’s not to say that games today are worse than they used to be, but simply to say that, as certain concepts and systems have grown more standardized and commonplace, they often feel familiar and comforting right from the start. One open world can feel much like another, one game’s progression systems or skill trees much like those we’ve seen many times before. Leave it to Remedy, though—a studio that has stayed fresh and idiosyncratic since leaving its first indelible mark on games with 2001’s Max Payne—to immerse us in a game of uncompromising originality.\n\nIt’s been 13 years since the original Alan Wake. Starring a writer of crime books who’s grappled with a terrible writer’s block after leaving his old protagonist, hard-boiled detective Alex Casey, behind, it felt borne out of Remedy creative director Sam Lake’s struggles to find a new creative direction following 2003’s Max Payne 2. Alan Wake was fascinating—a moody, atmospheric adventure that dared to give us a prickly, sometimes unlikeable hero—but for all of its heady ideas, it felt somehow restrained and safe, a game about horror that didn’t delve into horror itself.\n\nAlan Wake II, by contrast, is exhilaratingly, unrelentingly bold, as if bursting with 13 years’ worth of repressed creative energy. Daring in its structure, narratively unhinged, and jam-packed with thrilling uses of live action that brilliantly contribute to the sense that Alan (and you) are slipping between different layers of consciousness and existence, it’s a surreal odyssey that playfully weaves Remedy’s entire history into a tale about how the things we create can liberate us, or keep us trapped. In a year bursting with excitingly original games, Alan Wake II stands tall as the boldest, most invigorating reminder of what games can do when they hold unwaveringly true to a singular artistic vision, making it Kotaku’s 2023 Game of the Year.\n\nSo there you have it, Kotaku’s 12 best games of 2023, ranked.

        "articleBody": "Longtime Snake performer David Hayter was controversially replaced in 2015’s Metal Gear Solid V\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was Hideo Kojima’s final Metal Gear Solid game, and it was an odd one. Despite having some of the best sneaking action and gunplay, the open world and “missions” structure didn’t necessarily speak to fans of the more linear, tightly scripted feel of the previous games.\n\nBut MGS5’s most unexpected change was the decision to replace David Hayter, Solid Snake’s English voice actor since Metal Gear Solid’s release in 1998, with movie star Keifer Sutherland. And, as many fans rightly point out, the casting decision is even stranger considering that Snake doesn’t speak a whole lot in The Phantom Pain. Kojima’s decision to pass on Hayter for the part amounted to a bit of 2010s video game drama, as it seems Hayter was largely left in the dark as to why the casting change took place.\n\nBut maybe it’s time to turn a new page? In a recent post on Twitter (currently known as “X”), Hayter reports that he finally played the 2015 Metal Gear game that didn’t include him. Not only that, he seems to have enjoyed it.\n\nAfter saying he “put it off for years”, he confessed that the “game’s pretty fun” (maybe a not-so-subtle reference to the “you’re pretty good” line featured in a number of Metal Gear titles?) after noting that the “Laryngitic Snake” didn’t resonate as well. Right there with ya, Hayter.\n\nHayter has been known to post various Metal Gear- and other video game-related jokes, including one about just how long it’s been since the last main GTA game came out—that one garnered an MGS4 “Old Snake” reference.\n\nDavid Hayter has recently appeared in advertisements for the kinda-not-so-great Metal Gear Solid Master Collection. His “this is only the beginning” line in said ad has certainly left fans wondering what else is around the corner in the Metal Gear universe.",

        "authors": "Claire Lower",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "If nothing else, it makes an excellent Dole Whip dupe.\n\nThere is a rift between fancy food professionals and home cooks that never fails to annoy me, and it comes to a head whenever a new appliance gains an inordinate amount of popularity. We saw it with the air fryer and Instant Pot, when seasoned food personalities and chefs recoiled from both appliances, pronouncing them both “unnecessary,” without considering the benefits to home cooks, particularly those who live in households of two or fewer, and those with disabilities. The Ninja CREAMi is poised for such treatment, if the many Facebook groups dedicated to appliance are to be believed.\nWhat is the Ninja CREAMi?\n\nThe Ninja CREAMi falls into the category of “ice cream maker,” but it’s better at making “alternative” frozen treats than processing true custards and ice cream bases. According to the product description on the Ninja website, “The Ninja™ CREAMi® transforms frozen solid bases into ice cream, sorbets, milkshakes and more at the touch of a button. From healthy to indulgent, the Ninja® CREAMi™ can create frozen treats as unique as you are!”\n\nTo use the CREAMi, you blend ingredients together to create a liquid base, freeze it solid, then secure it to the appliance so the “creamify technology” (aka, a series of blades propelled by a powerful motor) can “break down a uniformly frozen block into an incredibly smooth, creamy texture in minutes.”\n\nBut it’s not as simple as that. Not all liquids freeze the same way, and getting the right texture on your frozen treats can take a bit of trial and error.\nWho is the Ninja CREAMi for?\n\nThe appliance is an absolute godsend for people with dietary restrictions, especially when you consider the price point of dairy-free and other alternative “ice creams.” Fruit juice, canned fruit, protein drinks, yogurt, coffee creamers, and alternative milks of all kinds are just a few of the ingredients that are often used to make bespoke frozen treats. \n\nIt does not, however, make very good ice cream, at least not without a lot of futzing. The standard vanilla ice cream recipe from the CREAMi manual is, frankly, subpar. The powerful “creamifying” blades do terrible things to heavy cream, effectively churning it into butter, giving your ice cream a greasy mouthfeel. There are ways you can work around it (reduce the cream and use more milk), but if you buy this appliance with the intent of making a lot of real-deal ice cream, you will end up frustrated and disappointed.\n\nBut if you are looking for ways to make low-fat offerings taste creamier and more indulgent than they actually are—or just want to turn a can of pie filling into sorbet—you will be delighted by the Ninja CREAMi.\n\nThere are a few add-ins you may want to buy\n\nThere are two ingredients I think every CREAMi owner should have: guar gum and citric acid. Guar gum is a naturally derived thickening and stabilizing agent that increases the viscosity of your frozen dessert. It prevents large ice crystals from forming, keeping the consistency smooth and creamy. Some CREAMi recipes call for cream cheese, which contains guar gum, but it’s cheaper to just buy a bag of the additive, and guar gum is vegan-friendly. You don’t need a ton—just 1/2 a teaspoon per pint is all it takes to make your not-really-ice cream taste and feel more like the real thing.\n\nCitric acid (aka, “sour MSG”) is another ingredient I used a lot in my CREAMi experiments, especially when playing around with fruit-flavored desserts. As little as 1/8 teaspoon increases the acidity, balancing any cloying qualities while heightening fruity flavors with a bit of contrast. \n\nKeep the motor runnin’\n\nIf you peruse various forums and Facebook groups dedicated to the appliance, you’ll notice a few people complaining about the motor giving out. Ninja seems to be decent about replacing broken models, but the easiest way to prevent literal burn out is to let your frozen base soften for five or 10 minutes before letting the appliance do its thing. Once I made this adjustment, I found my desserts came out smoother and creamier, and didn’t need to be re-spun as often.\nWhat’s this “re-spun” business?\n\nOn paper, the Ninja CREAMi is easy to operate. Freeze your base, secure it to the appliance, and select your appropriate program (“ice cream,” “sorbet,” etc.). The blades do their thing, and your base is transformed into a smooth, frozen confection without any discirnable ice crystals. In reality, some bases come out dry and crumbly the first (and second) time you process them, and you have to process them again, either with the “Re-spin” function, or with the original program. Letting the base sit out for a few minutes can help with this, but sometimes re-spinning is unavoidable, especially with fat-free, or very low-fat bases.\nWhat a professional food writer without dietary restrictions makes with a Ninja CREAMi\n\nFinding recipes for the CREAMi is not hard. The appliance comes with a recipe booklet and, as I’ve mentioned a couple of times, there are tons of forums and groups dedicated to CREAMi recipes, and you can find a fair amount of recipes on the Ninja website. While I haven’t found an “ice cream” that compares to a traditionally churned vanilla, I have been thrilled with sorbets and sorbet-adjacent treats. I have three favorites:\n\n    A 15-ounce can of fruit or pie filling (with the accompanying liquid) + 1/8-1/4 teaspoon citric acid (depending on the sweetness of your fruit and fondness for sour things): Blend, freeze until solid, and process using the “Sorbet” function.\n\n    A 15-ounce can of fruit + a 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk (can reduce according to personal preference): Blend, freeze until solid, and process using the “Lite Ice Cream” function\n\nAnd there is the piña colada Dole Whip dupe, which I am utterly obsessed with.\n\nHow to make vegan piña colada “Dole Whip” in the Ninja CREAMi\n\nDole whip is a frozen dessert that is often imitated and rarely duplicated, but this recipe is incredibly close to the real thing, with one difference—a hint of coconut flavor, making it more “piña colada” than straight up “pineapple.” Other than that, the texture and flavor is remarkably similar, and you only need three (incidentally vegan) ingredients.\nIngredients (makes roughly 1 1/2 pints):\n\n    15-ounce can Coco Lopez cream of coconut\n\n    20-ounce canned pineapple chunks (with juice)\n\n    1/4 teaspoon citric acid\n\nBlend all three ingredients with whatever blender you have until smooth. Pour into CREAMi-compatible pints and freeze overnight, or until frozen solid. Remove from the freezer and let soften briefly on the counter for five minutes. Attach to the Ninja CREAMi and process using the “Lite Ice Cream” setting. Enjoy immediately for a soft serve consistency, or return to the freezer for a couple of hours if you want something more “scoopable.",

        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "You can embrace the holiday spirit without going bankrupt.\n\nThe holiday season often leads even the savviest of spenders to overextend their budgets. Gift giving, parties, traveling, food—it all adds up, especially on top of regular monthly bills. If you feel anxiety brewing about your finances this time of year, take a deep breath: There are specific things you can do to prevent overspending, no matter where you are starting from.\n\nTrack every dollar\n\nFirst, start tracking your spending down to every last dollar. Download a budgeting app or use a spreadsheet. The act alone of having to input and record where your money is going each day makes you more aware of bad habits. Analyze the recent data, looking for those frequent little expenses on things you likely won’t even remember or care about next month.\nList must-haves vs. nice-to-haves\n\nNext, make your holiday gift list then divide people into must-have and nice-to have categories. Must-haves should be immediate family and very close friends where you feel obligated. Nice-to-haves are those you’d like to get gifts for if possible. Be honest with yourself about priorities and expectations.\n\nSet firm spending limits\n\nFor each must-have person, set a firm limit for spending on gifts, say $50 or $75 max. Having the endpoint caps explicitly stated makes it easier to say no to things in stores that exceed boundaries. For nice-to-have folks, set even lower thresholds, gifting only if you have extra money later.\n\nTry cash-stuffing\n\nThe cash-stuffing method, “or envelope system,” helps turn your budgeting into a more visceral, even “gamified” experience: You have different physical envelopes for different categories of expenses, and you stuff each envelope with a budgeted amount of cash for one category (or pay period). The key here is you can only spend money in a certain category (say, groceries or gifts) from its designated envelope. Once the envelope is empty, that’s that until your next paycheck arrives.\n\nCash-stuffing works because it forces you to be more intentional (deciding how much money gets allocated into each envelope) and more disciplined (you can’t put more money into the envelope once it runs out).\n\nKeep perspective\n\nWhen you feel yourself getting carried away or tempted by holiday commercialism, pause for perspective. Make a list of things most important for well-being—family, friends, doing meaningful things. No material goods you can buy ultimately provide more lasting joy than those pillars. Keep the holiday season about value, not money-sucking excess. Stay intentional with spending while still embracing the spirit of the season.",

Innovation is exciting, but it also comes with risks. Sometimes, it's best to play it safe.\n\nThat being said, to prove that no iPhone is the same, here are the changes Apple has implemented for each line, from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 15.\n\niPhone 11\n\nThe iPhone 11, with a starting price of $699, shoved the iPhone XR out of the way with new cameras, improved audio, and a better display. \n\nThe 2019-launched smartphone shot 4K video at 60 frames per second, up from 1080p at 60 frames per second.

The iPhone 11's successor also brought 5G support. However, at the time, many critics shrugged at this because 5G wasn't widely available. Let's take a look at the series' new features.\n\nCamera\n\n    Updated wide camera with improved low-light performance\n\n    Night Mode now featured on all cameras (instead of just the wide shooter)\n\n    New \"Night mode time-lapse\" feature\n\n    Deep Fusion now on all four cameras, including wide, ultrawide, selfie, and telephoto shooters\n\n    Longer telephoto lens (Pro Max only)\n\n    Updated wide lens with improved optical image stabilization, also known as \"Sensor Shift,\" and better low-light performance (Pro Max only)\n\n    Apple ProRAW, an option to access minimally processed photos (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\n    HDR video recording, allowing you to capture more vivid videos (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\n    New LiDAR scanner, unlocking new depth perception capabilities and AR features (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\nDisplay\n\n    Higher-res Super Retina XDR display\n\n    Increased display durability with Ceramic Shield\n\n    Larger display (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\nConnectivity\n\n    MagSafe charging, a new magnetic way of juicing up your iPhone\n\n    5G support \n\niPhone 13\n\nThe iPhone 13 reportedly introduced 20% smaller notch, but in my personal opinion, I didn't like the change. \n\nSure, it was less wide, but it dipped even further into the display. On the plus side, this family of phones debuted a bigger battery, which means runtime on a single charge should have improved over the iPhone 12. But what else did the iPhone 13 bring to the table? Let's take a look.\n\nCamera\n\n    Cinematic Mode, a rack focus feature that changes the depth effect of your videos with bokeh\n\n    Updated wide camera with brighter results in photos, videos\n\n    \"Sensor Shift\" now available for entry-level phones (mini and standard iPhone)\n\n    Better Night Mode\n\n    Telephoto now offers up to 3x optical zoom (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\n    New autofocus, better low-light performance in ultrawide camera (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\n    Better light-gathering for wide camera (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\n    Photographic Styles (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\n    ProRes video, an Apple video codec that preserves detail in HDR imagery\n\nDisplay\n\n    Brighter display\n\n    ProMotion, a variable refresh-rate feature from 10Hz to 120Hz (Pro and Pro Max only)\n\niPhone 14\n\nSo long, mini!

        "articleBody": "Find love, a hookup, or something in between.\n\nMeeting someone organically, or \"in the wild\" as some call it, is a challenge these days. Unless you've got a strong case of main character syndrome or are literally the star of a romantic comedy, you're more likely to meet someone by online dating through an app or browser.\n\nBut online dating isn't always easy. It can be tough to keep up a conversation with someone you don't know anything about, especially if you're only basing your opinion on their looks. And that's if you can even find someone worth striking up a conversation with in the first place (a.k.a. someone who doesn't immediately give you \"the ick.\")\n\nWe found some great dating app options, specifically for men, that are a good place to start when you're ready to put yourself out there. Read on for tips on how to navigate the online dating scene, and our tried-and-true recommendations for the best apps to do it with.\n\nWhy is online dating so hard?\n\nOnline dating poses a challenge for both men and women, but in different ways: If it's a lady you're pursuing, chances are she's received more than a few unsolicited messages already. For women, maneuvering around the bounty of creeps is often more work than it's worth.\n\nKnowing what to say when you're first messaging someone can feel impossible. You don't want to come across as weird or too overeager, but you also don't want to seem uninterested. It's a fine line to walk, and with the added competition, a seemingly unfeasible challenge. Here are a few tips to help you get the conversation started, and help you move past that first message writer's block.\nBe yourself and respect boundaries\n\nThe internet is plagued with tales of nasty messages and absolutely whack opening lines from unsavory men. Avoiding being \"that guy\" with someone you just matched with shouldn't be hard — simply don't be pushy about sexting, getting a phone number, or meeting up in person. (Just don't be pushy about anything, really.)\n\nAs for devising an opener that'll blossom into a nice conversation, it's important to remember that even the most harmless intent to be funny or flattering can quickly go south.\n\nFor men who are a little rusty or generally shy about messaging first, choosing the right dating app can make all the difference. Bumble, the app where only women can make the first move, is an obvious safe choice for the latter. \n\nHere's a good rule of thumb: Be yourself. There's no magic formula for finding the perfect match, but being yourself is your best bet to find someone who shares your interests and values. It also doesn't hurt to look at their profile before you start chatting. This will help you get a better idea of who they are and what they're looking for. Seeing someone's hobbies, favorite movies, career goals, or even political views before talking to them opens up a wealth of clever icebreakers. \n\nRelated Stories\n\n    Best hookup apps and dating sites to find casual sex with no strings attached\n    The best dating sites for finding serious, long-term relationships\n    The best 420-friendly dating sites for finding a budding romance\n    Find your perfect player 2: These are the best dating sites for gamers\n    The best dating sites for introverts, wallflowers, and anyone hesitant to try online dating\n\nBe honest about what you want\n\nTinder can be the right app for some singles, but it's not the only option.

        "articleBody": "Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, have provided substantial evidence supporting the potential role of statins in mitigating venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk associated with hormone therapy in postmenopausal women, possibly reshaping the risk-benefit considerations for this population.\n\nIn a paper, \"Statin Use and the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism in Women Taking Hormone Therapy,\" published in JAMA Network Open, the researchers used a cohort of 223,949 women (mean age 57.5 years) with 20,359 cases and 203,590 matched controls to conduct a nested case-control design analyzing data from a commercially insured claims database in the United States.\n\nStatin therapy was associated with reduced VTE risk in women on hormone therapy, highlighting potential benefits for women with perimenopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy exposure without statin therapy increased VTE risk by 53%, but when combined with statins, the risk was reduced by 18% compared to those without hormone therapy or statin exposure.\n\nMenopause can cause problematic symptoms like hot flashes, sleep disruptions, cognitive changes, vaginal dryness and urine leakage that can significantly impact a woman's quality of life. Hormone therapy is often used to manage these symptoms. However, hormone therapy has a downside, as previous studies indicate an elevated risk of developing blood clots or VTE.\n\nStatin drug therapy has been associated with reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events and VTE. Statin therapy, along with hormone therapy, has looked promising in some previous studies, though with different dosage guidelines than are typical in the US.\n\nThe current study aimed to clarify the association between hormone therapy, statin use, and VTE risk, specifically in the US population of women aged 50 to 64. The results show that statin therapy reduced hormone therapy–associated VTE risk, with high-intensity statins showing a more significant risk reduction.\n\nThe authors conclude that while statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of VTE associated with exogenous hormones, it did not eliminate the risk, suggesting that more controlled studies are needed.",

        "articleBody": "Air pollution may trigger more asthma attacks in urban children and teens, a new study reports. Even moderate levels of ozone and fine airborne particulates—two ingredients of smog—appear to increase kids' risk of asthma attacks, according to findings published online in The Lancet Planetary Health journal.\n\n\"The strong association this study demonstrates between specific air pollutants among children in impoverished urban communities and non-viral asthma attacks further augments the evidence that reducing air pollution would improve human health,\" said Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, acting director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nThe study also tied the two pollutants to distinct changes in children's airways that could trigger an asthma attack, according to study leader Dr. Matthew Altman, an associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle, and colleagues. It's one of the first times elevated levels of distinctive air pollutants in specific urban locations have been tied to the risk of asthma attacks.\n\nDuring an asthma attack, inflammation causes the lining of airways to swell as muscles around the airways contract and mucus floods the passages—all substantially narrowing the space through which air passes in and out of the lungs.\n\nChildren in low-income urban areas of the United States are at particularly high risk for asthma attacks, the researchers said in an NIH news release.\n\nThe study included 208 children aged six to 17 with attack-prone asthma living in low-income neighborhoods in one of nine different U.S. cities. The researchers later validated their findings in a second group of 189 people aged six to 20 living in low-income areas of four U.S. cities.\n\nThe team tracked daily air quality and compared it to reports of asthma attacks in the urban children. They also checked to make sure that the children weren't suffering from respiratory viruses that can promote asthma.\n\nThe researchers found that asthma attacks were caused by pollution rather than viruses in nearly 30% of the children, two to three times the proportion seen in children who don't live in urban areas.\n\nThe attacks were specifically associated with locally elevated levels of fine particulates and ozone in outdoor air, the study authors said.\n\nBy analyzing nasal cell samples obtained from the children, the investigators further found that elevated levels of those pollutants affected the expression of genes that play a role in airway inflammation.\n\nThese results could lead to treatments that would counteract the harmful effects of air pollution on human airways, the researchers reported.\n\nThe findings also indicate that people with asthma might benefit from toting around personal air quality monitors, which could warn them of conditions that contribute to asthma attacks.",

        "articleBody": "Have you ever read an article that made you say “This was made by AI”?\n\nI’m sure you have. Well, who am I kidding — we all have. Especially us Medium writers.\n\nMost of us are avid readers. We all read multiple articles a day and several books a month. Most of us write thousands of words every day. We all know what “human writing” sounds like.\n\nBut until recently, I still couldn’t put a finger on it.\n\nLast November, I got a job as a Content Writer and Editor. Since then, I‘ve written and edited 12 to 20 articles every week. It was through this repetitive, highly systematic, and quite stimulating job responsibility where I noticed consistent giveaways to AI output.\n\nI learned how ChatGPT sounded to help my writers sound more human. And now I’m going to share these to you.\nWriting with AI\n\nThis post isn’t to dismiss AI.\n\nWe absolutely love AI, and I use it regularly. If you use it, more power to you — but it has to be in a way that feels and sounds human. You can’t be lazy just because of it.\n\nCompelling, human articles written with AI tools is high-powered and efficient writing. Articles that look and sound like AI is just trashy.\n\nThat’s why I’m writing this.\n\nWe writers can’t avoid AI, and we shouldn’t — we need to adapt and utilize any tools that the industry gives us and keep raising the standards of our craft. A big part of that is utilizing the efficiency and speed of AI, without compromising on your article’s humanity.\n\nSo if you want to use AI to write your articles, make sure to edit out these words.\n1. Transformative\n\nExample: “Semantic web methodologies propose a transformative approach by enhancing the depth of search engine understanding.”\n\nAI giveaway: This obvious giveaway word overhypes whatever you’re trying to describe and sells it as something that changes the world. Not everything has to be “transformative.” It’s unnecessary and ostentatious.\n\nEdit: Remove. Often, removing it won’t change the message whatsoever. But if absolutely needed, change it to something more mundane and simple.\n2. Foster/fostering\n\nExample: “It establishes a cohesive visual identity, fostering a sense of reliability and professionalism.”\n\nAI giveaway: I particularly hate this word. It’s become a catch-all for writers who don’t know exactly what it is they are describing, and it’s so overused and non-descriptive. If I see more than two of these words in an entire article, I flag it.\n\nEdit: Change it into something more specific, descriptive, and context-appropriate. Like create, build, forge, nurture, etc.\n3. Tapestry/A tapestry of…\n\nExample: “Knowledge graphs leverage semantic relationships, transforming data into a rich tapestry of interconnected knowledge.”\n\nAI giveaway: ChatGPT uses this so often, and I’ve come to hate it with a passion. Anything connected doesn’t have to be a “tapestry” of anything. Sometimes they are just connected. Sometimes maybe even just related.\n\nEdit: Remove or rephrase. It’s a dead giveaway.\n4. This is about … / All about …\n\nExample: “The Crypto Pro Playbook is all about putting power back into your hands, allowing you to navigate the crypto landscape without unnecessary expenses.”\n\nAI giveaway: When you use “this is about …” or “X is all about …” in your article, I automatically assume that:\n\n    AI wrote your content, or\n    You don’t know what you’re talking about.\n\nWell-written content doesn’t say that “something is all about something else …”, they are vastly more specific.\n\nEdit: Change to something more specific and descriptive.\n5. Think of X as …\n\nExample: “Think of influential blogs and forums as your digital mentors.”\n\nAI giveaway: There are better ways to signal a metaphor. This specific turn of phrase is a pattern that many AI software repeat.\n\nEdit: Be more direct. Don’t tell readers to “think of it as …” They’re reading your work — they’re already thinking.\n6. Like/It’s like …\n\nExample: “It’s like having a front-row seat to the future of crypto — all from the comfort of your couch.”\n\nAI giveaway: Same as above, it’s a highly repetitive and recognizable pattern.\n\nEdit: Remove and rephrase your sentence.\n7. Not only … but also …\n\nExample: “E-commerce businesses leveraging pillar pages not only streamline user navigation but also position themselves as industry leaders”\n\nAI giveaway: It’s a highly repetitive and distinguishing pattern. And, it’s unnecessary. Grammarly is always insistent that I change it, and I think any editor will agree. The only times I like to use it is when the two points are:\n\n    Somewhat contrary to each other,\n    Not often linked together, or\n    Unexpected\n\nEdit: If it doesn’t fit any of the criteria above, just change the sentence to say “and.” Simplicity is always best.\nBonus: Sentence length\n\nAI is bad at making great sentences. AI outputs tend to have unimpressive paragraph construction, mostly characterized by monotonous sentence length. There’s an easy fix.\n\nFor more human-sounding content, switch up your sentence length. I like to use what I call the “short — long — short” format. For example, the first paragraph of this section\nFinal thoughts\n\nWriting with AI is a very useful thing — and I firmly believe that writers who don’t adopt AI can be easily overtaken by those who do.\n\nBut just because you’re using AI doesn’t mean you should be lazy. AI is still a long way off from copying a human writer off the bat. If you want to get the same level of quality, you need to be diligent in editing.\n\nTake out those 7 common dead giveaways of AI content and level up your writing game this 2024.\nHey! I wrote a … kind of a sequel ??\n\nSince this blew up, and I see a lot of comments about AI use, I thought I’d share my thoughts about it.\n\nThis article explains my framework for using AI in writing. Plus, my take on the questions “When should I use AI?” and maybe even “Why do some people hate AI so much?” You can read it here:\n\nSomething I feel is not often talked about.\n\nAlso, big announcement…\nI’m writing a book about editing AI content.\n\nThere are things I’m planning and discovering, but one thing I know for sure is that …\n\nIt’s going to be free for early supporters.\n\nI’m going to post the complete contents of the book in my Buy Me a Coffee page. Supporters can buy a $5 coffee once, and read everything for free once it’s done (to make sure I stick to it). Completely voluntary though!\n\nMore deets in that article.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "title": "New obesity drugs are coming. Here's how they could change everything.",
        "authors": "Tara Haelle",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A steady stream of weight loss drugs, which mimic naturally occurring hormones, are in the pipeline. This competition may finally lead to lower prices and greater supplies of these highly effective drugs, and maybe replace some injectables with pills.\n\nOzempic (above) was not the first of the hormone-mimicking drugs to hit the market, but it was the first to become a household name as celebrities shared their weight loss success from its off-label use on social media.\n\nThe recent approval of another obesity drug, Zepbound, expands the options for medications to manage weight, but it comes with the same cost and access challenges that plague other weight loss drugs in its class.\n\nThe drugs in this class are agonists, or mimics, of natural gut hormones that affect the body’s metabolism and hunger signals in the brain. But the currently approved drugs, synthetic versions of these hormones, are large molecules that are expensive and time-consuming to manufacture, which has meant high prices for consumers and growing drug shortages. Further, most of these drugs are injections, rather than oral pills, and usually require refrigeration for storage. With more than four in 10 Americans—and nearly 2 billion people worldwide—affected by obesity, the promise of these new drugs to treat the world’s fastest growing chronic disease has been clashing with the reality of their cost and access problems.\n\nIn addition to the complex manufacturing, the small number of obesity drugs on the market has meant less competition, driving up prices for consumers. That’s a problem as many private health insurance plans still do not cover obesity medications. Although researchers are developing oral versions of these medications—including versions that are cheaper and faster to make and distribute—those aren’t yet ready for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the existing oral medications aren’t as effective as the injections.\n\n“The big issue is the fact that right now, not only are the drugs expensive, but it’s also difficult to get injections to places where people may need them,” Ali Zentner, a weight management physician and medical director of Revolution Medical Clinic in Vancouver, Canada, says. “And in the United States, for example, equity depends on your income and your insurance—it doesn’t really matter where you are.”\n\nHowever, a half dozen or so candidates in this same drug class have been making their way through clinical trials, and as several of them are on track to head to the FDA in the next few years, experts hope they will finally begin expanding access so the world can begin making progress on addressing the obesity epidemic.\n\nOne drug in development that has been turning heads is orforglipron, a drug like the already approved agonist drugs but which is a smaller molecule, making it easier and cheaper to produce. It’s also an oral pill, not an injection, which is not as sensitive to storage temperature as injectable medications are. Though only just entering phase 3 studies, the effectiveness seen from orforglipron in a phase 2 trial suggests that a more accessible option is not out of reach.\n\nExisting medications are “in a form that we can use easily, but we can’t make an injectable all that easily,” says Sean Wharton, an adjunct professor at McMaster University and medical director of the Wharton Medical Clinic who is leading the research on orforglipron. “To have something that you have to take every week for the billions of people across the planet that are living with obesity means that you need a product that can get there, that can be mass produced, and then given out in an appropriate fashion.”\nA confusing collection of weight loss drugs\n\nThe rapid pace of approvals for this new drug class has led to a dizzying list of names that can be difficult to track.\n\nA major reason for the confusion is that the FDA approves the same chemical drug for different conditions, and companies give different brand names to the drug based on the condition it treats.\n\nMany people have heard of Ozempic, the brand name for semaglutide, which is approved for type 2 diabetes. That same compound, semaglutide, is also approved to treat obesity and goes by the brand name Wegovy.\n\nAnother major drug in this class is tirzepatide, which is approved for type 2 diabetes as Mounjaro, and for obesity as Zepbound.\n\nZepbound’s approval last month came after clinical trials showed people with obesity lost up to 21 percent of their body weight with the highest dose.\n\nWith the pace of these approvals matched only by demand for them, what hasn’t kept up is access to these medications, primarily due to drug shortages and their cost.\n\nShortages of Mounjaro, which costs $1,023 per month without insurance, are already expected to last through August, 2024. Its competitor, Ozempic, costs $936 and is also limited. Those supply issues are expected to carry over to Zepbound (same compound as Mounjaro) and Wegovy (same compound as Ozempic)—and are similarly expensive. Zepbound’s price is $1,060; Wegovy’s, $1,349.\nA new class of drugs\n\nOzempic was not the first of this new class of drugs to hit the market, but it was the first to become a household name as celebrities shared their weight loss success from its off-label use on social media. It was also the most effective drug of its kind when it was approved as Wegovy for obesity in 2021.\n\nBut all of these drugs, called GLP-1 agonists, are injectable medications that mimic the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut hormone that stimulates the release of insulin. And over the near-decade since the first GLP-1 agonist was approved for obesity in 2014, scientists have learned enough to begin expanding their research to include other gut hormones.\n\n“This is new science, and this is coming from someone who has been in this field for over 40 years,” says Robert Kushner, an endocrinologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who consults for some of the companies developing these drugs. “As we start to harness the power of these intestinal and pancreatic hormones individually and as combinations, we are really learning along the way.”\n\nWhile these new drugs definitely have side effects—some of which can be serious—they are biologically completely distinct from the less-than-stellar legacy of past weight loss drugs.\n\n“We’re now, for the first time, understanding that, in part, the gateway to regulating appetite and treating the dysregulation of appetite is through these gut hormones,” Kushner adds.\n\nZepbound is the first obesity drug to exploit more than one gut hormone: it mimics both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), another hormone involved in metabolism that plays a role in obesity. But GLP-1 and GIP are just two of the dozens of gut hormones that affect digestion and other metabolic processes.\n\nAs scientists learn more about the functions of other gut hormones, they are testing drugs that mimic those as well. Many of the newer drugs coming down the pipeline mimic two or three gut hormones, such as GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon.\n\nIt often happens in medicine that one or two agents of a certain drug class are development and then the class opens up more, Zentner says. “We are on the precipice,” now that researchers understand the biology of these various hormones, she says. “We’ve cracked the code of GLP, GIP, glucagon,” and other gut hormones, so now scientists are testing what happens when they combine multiple synthetic versions in one drug.\nHow the new drugs work\n\nThese drugs work in multiple ways that affect metabolism and energy consumption and expenditure.\n\nBy stimulating the release of insulin after eating, they help reduce glucose circulating in the blood and reduce insulin resistance.\n\nThey also slow down digestion and the emptying of the stomach so that people feel full longer.\n\nThey stimulate the burning of fat cells and reduce fat in the liver.\n\nFinally, importantly, they also send satiety signals to the brain, telling it not only that it doesn’t need additional calories but also that it doesn’t want additional calories.\n\n“I think of obesity as a multi-factorial disorder where genetics, environment, development and behavior play a role in a person’s likelihood of having the disease, but the most important organ regulating the weight is the brain,” says Fatima Cody Stanford, an associate professor of medicine and obesity medicine specialist for adults and children at Harvard Medical School.\n\nThat’s because the brain is very efficient at hunting for and storing food, essential functions in times of scarcity.\n\n“When we talk about appetite regulation or energy regulation, we evolved to endure famine,” Zentner says. But many people today live among an abundance of food, and the brain’s evolution hasn’t kept up.\n\nThe beauty of these new medicines is that they block the inappropriate starvation response that causes obesity, Zentner says. For patients with obesity—even when they eat—their brain still thinks they’re starving. With these new drugs, however, “not only do people not feel hungry, but they just don’t have the craving or food thoughts they used to because their brains are not starving.”\n\nThe problem is that they aren’t easy or cheap to manufacture. But clinical trial findings from Wharton’s drug, orforglipron, and other research findings—unveiled at the annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) last summer and at the Obesity Society meeting last fall—suggest that researchers are finding ways to overcome those obstacles.\n\n“What we saw at ADA was a further introduction of the injectable molecules… where you’re getting weight loss of more than 25 percent. That's huge,” Wharton says. But these injectable drugs risk continued supply problems. “If we develop a pill that’s easily stored that you can take every day, that may be the most available drug that’s cheap.”\nBetter, cheaper drugs in the pipeline\n\nThe upcoming crop of drugs in the pipeline attempt to improve on existing ones in three ways; many act on multiple gut hormones for a synergistic therapeutic effect; a couple are pills, which have wider temperature ranges for storage, making them accessible in places with less reliable refrigeration. Finally, some of the oral drugs in development, like Wharton’s, are made of smaller molecules that are easier and faster to manufacture, making them cheaper and less likely to fall victim to the shortages occurring with semaglutide and tirzepatide.\n\nThe main gut hormones being mimicked and combined in different medications are GLP-1, GIP, glucagon, and amylin—another hormone released by the pancreas which regulates blood glucose levels, slows down digestion, and reduces food consumption.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the company that makes Ozempic/Wegovy, is working on a drug combination of semaglutide and cagrilintide, which mimics amylin. In a phase 2 trial of the drug—dubbed CagriSema—participants with type 2 diabetes experienced reduced blood sugar and a 16 percent loss in body weight.\n\nTwo other drugs, from other pharmaceutical companies, mimic GLP-1 and glucagon, a hormone with receptors in the liver. One of these is survodutide, whose phase 2 trial resulted in participants losing 15 to 20 percent of their body weight, depending on dose. That trial is ongoing, so participants could still lose more.\n\nThe other GLP-1 and glucagon combo drug is pemvidutide, being tested for both obesity and fatty liver disease. In the most recent results from late November, participants lost 10 to 20 percent of their body weight, and nearly a third of those taking the highest dose lost 20 percent or more.\nSide effects\n\nLike semaglutide and tirzepatide, however, all these drugs come with gastrointestinal side effects: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. One in four people taking pemvidutide, for example, dropped out because these side effects were too intense.\n\nThe drug furthest along of those that attempt to mimic three gut hormones is retatrutide from Eli Lilly, the same company that makes Mounjaro/Zepbound.\n\nRetatrutide mimics glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP in combination. Participants taking the highest dose lost about 24 percent of their body weight, the most of any weight loss drug so far and rivaling the effects of some bariatric surgery types. For example, after one year, average weight loss is 25 percent of body weight for sleeve gastrectomy and an average 14 percent of body weight for adjustable gastric banding. Retatrutide also reduced liver fat, so it may be a contender for treating fatty liver disease too.\n\nOne of the oral pills showing the most effectiveness for obesity is an oral version of semaglutide from Novo Nordisk that’s a higher dose than their current Rybelsus. It showed a 15 percent loss in body weight at the ADA meeting in June, but the company hasn’t submitted it to the FDA for approval, yet.\nFocus on oral drugs\n\nMeanwhile, participants taking orforglipron, the drug Wharton’s team is developing, in a phase 2 trial lost 15 percent of their body weight—about middle of the pack compared to other drugs. But, again, it is a small molecule that can be made and transported cheaply and easily.\n\n“That was why that presentation was such a jaw-dropping moment,” Wharton says. “This was pretty good weight loss, but it’s bigger than that. It's a chemical structure that can be made in a lab like that,” he says, snapping his fingers. “This is groundbreaking research, because if this is for real, this is going to eclipse all of the injectables just because of price.” A phase 3 trial for orforglipron began in May 2023.\n\nThese drugs are the furthest along, but more are on the way. Some will never make it to the FDA, often due to side effects, but experts hope the ones that do make the cut will drive down prices while providing more options to those who can’t use—or can’t access—the existing drugs.\n\n“For me, it’s about finding the right tool for the right person,” Cody Stanford says. “We, the world, want obesity to be easy, but it’s complex. The more we learn about the disease, we learn it’s not a one-size-fits-all thought process. Asthma is not the same in every person. Diabetes is not the same in every person. Cancer is not the same in every person. But these medications,” she says, are the newest tools doctors can employ in addressing “obesity as a disease.”",

        "articleBody": "Once a year, an astronomical alignment ushers in this seasonal change. The solstice is celebrated across the world—and shrouded in myth.\n\nThis year, the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice falls on December 21 at 10:27 p.m. EST. South of the Equator, this same moment marks the unofficial beginning of summer. Solstices occur at the same time around the world, but their local times vary with time zones. \n\nTraditionally, summer and winter solstices helped mark the changing of the seasons—along with their counterparts, the spring and autumnal equinoxes. However, today’s meteorologists officially use temperature records instead to draw lines between the seasons. So what exactly are solstices—and how have they been celebrated throughout history? Here’s all you need to know.\n\nWhat are solstices?\n\nSolstices occur because Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted about 23.4 degrees relative to Earth's orbit around the sun. This tilt drives our planet's seasons, as the Northern and Southern Hemispheres get unequal amounts of sunlight over the course of a year. From March to September, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the sun, driving its spring and summer. From September to March, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away, so it feels like autumn and winter. The Southern Hemisphere's seasons are reversed.\n\nOn two moments each year—what are called solstices—Earth's axis is tilted most closely toward the sun. The hemisphere tilted most toward our home star sees its longest day, while the hemisphere tilted away from the sun sees its longest night. During the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice—which always falls around December 22—the Southern Hemisphere gets its summer solstice. During the Northern Hemisphere’s summer solstice—which always falls around June 21—the Southern Hemisphere gets its winter solstice.\n\nYou can also think about solstices in terms of where on Earth the sun appears. When it’s a summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun appears directly over the Tropic of Cancer, the latitude line at 23.5 degrees North. (That’s as far north as you can go and still see the sun directly overhead.) During the Northern Hemisphere’s winter solstice, the sun appears directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, the Tropic of Cancer’s southern mirror image.\n\nDo other planets experience solstices? \n\nEarth is not the only planet with solstices and equinoxes; any planet with a tilted rotational axis would see them, too. In fact, planetary scientists use solstices and equinoxes to define \"seasons\" for other planets in our solar system.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that other planets' seasons don't climatically equal those on Earth for a few reasons. First, planets vary in their axial tilts: Venus's axis of rotation is tilted by just three degrees, so there's much less seasonal difference between the Venusian summer and winter solstices than those on Earth. In addition, planets such as Mars have less circular orbits than Earth's, which means that their distances from the sun vary more dramatically than ours do, with correspondingly bigger effects on seasonal temperature.\n\nEarth’s axial tilt plays a much bigger role than its near-circular orbit in governing annual seasons. Earth makes its closest annual approach of the sun about two weeks after the December solstice, during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. Earth is farthest from the sun about two weeks after the June solstice, during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.\n\nThe solstice through history\n\nFor millennia, cultures around the world have devised ways to celebrate and revere these celestial events—from building structures that align with the solstice to throwing raucous festivals in its honor.\n\nThough the purpose of the enigmatic English structure Stonehenge remains unknown, this 5,000-year-old monument has a famously special relationship with the solstices. On the summer solstice, the complex’s Heel Stone, which stands outside Stonehenge’s main circle, lines up with the rising sun.\n\nIn Egypt, the Great Pyramids at Giza appear to be aligned with the sun as well. When viewed from the Sphinx, the sun sets between the pyramids of Khufu and Khafre during the summer solstice—though it remains unclear precisely how the ancient Egyptians oriented it this way.\n\nMany cultures have found unique ways to mark the summer solstice. The traditional Scandinavian holiday of Midsummer welcomes it with maypole dancing, drinking, and romance. During the Slavic holiday of Ivan Kupala, people wear floral wreaths and dance around bonfires, while some plucky souls jump over the fires as a way of ensuring good luck and health. In a more modern tradition, the people of Fairbanks, Alaska, swing in the summer solstice with a nighttime baseball game to celebrate the fact that they can get up to 22.5 hours of daylight in the summer. The Midnight Sun Game has been played since 1906.\n\nThe winter solstice has had its share of celebrations, too. On June 24, in time with the Southern Hemisphere’s winter solstice, the Inca Empire celebrated Inti Raymi, a festival that honored the Inca religion’s powerful sun god Inti and marked the Inca new year. The festival is still celebrated throughout the Andes, and since 1944, a reconstruction of Inti Raymi has been staged in Cusco, Peru, less than two miles from its Inca Empire home. Ancient Romans celebrated the winter solstice with Saturnalia, a seven-day festival that involved giving presents, decorating houses with plants, and lighting candles. And Iranians celebrate Yalda in December. The festival—a mainstay since Zoroastrianism was Iran’s dominant religion—traditionally honors the birth of Mithra, the ancient Persian goddess of light.\n\nMisconceptions about the solstices\n\nIf solstices mark the brightest and darkest days of the year, why don’t temperatures reflect that?\n\nIn short, it’s because it takes time for Earth’s land and water to heat up and cool down. In the U.S., the year’s coldest temperatures set in after-mid January, roughly a month after the Northern Hemisphere’s winter solstice. Likewise, thermometers hit their high in the U.S. in July and August, weeks after the summer solstice.\n\nSome believe, too, that since Earth’s rotation is slowing down, each new solstice sets a new record for daytime length. But that’s not the case.\n\nIt’s certainly true that Earth’s rotation has slowed over billions of years, as Earth loses angular momentum to our planet’s tides. Growth lines on fossil corals show that more than 400 million years ago, days on Earth lasted less than 22 hours.\n\nBut Earth’s gradual slowing down isn’t the only factor at play. Picture a figure skater twirling on their skates; they can speed up or slow down their twirls by how much they tuck in their limbs. In much the same way, changes in the distribution of Earth’s mass—from the winds of El Niño to the melting of Greenland’s ice—can subtly tweak our planet’s rotation rate.\n\nTaking all this into account, it’s thought that the longest day since the 1830s occurred sometime in 1912. It lasted less than four milliseconds longer than the recent average.",

        "articleBody": "Rishi Sunak is under fire from his own MPs after rowing back on plans to lift the salary threshold for a family visa – with some Tories accusing him of \"weakness\".\n\nThe prime minister said the government was \"increasing the salary threshold significantly\" to £38,700 in \"early 2025\" - a change from the original plan laid out by Home Secretary James Cleverly earlier this month.\n\nSponsored link\n\nThe threshold for a family visa - which applies to Britons who wish to bring family members to the UK - was due to rise from £18,600 to £38,700 next spring in a bid to reduce legal net migration, which hit a record high last year.\n\nBut on Thursday night the Home Office quietly watered down the measure, saying the threshold would first be raised to £29,000 from the spring, and then increased in \"incremental stages\" - though no timetable was set for when the top figure would be introduced.\n\nThe climbdown has angered Tory MPs on the right of the party in favour of tighter migration controls.\n\nDavid Jones, deputy chairman of the right-wing European Research Group, told the PA news agency it was a \"regrettable sign of weakness\" while Jonathan Gullis, a Conservative former minister wrote on X that it was \"deeply disappointing and undermines our efforts\".\n\nFormer minister Sir John Hayes, chairman of the Common Sense Group of Tory MPs, told the BBC the earnings threshold should rise to £38,700 \"quickly\" to give people \"certainty\".\n\nRobert Jenrick, who quit as immigration minister over the government's stalled Rwanda plan, was also among the critics, with a source close to him saying: \"The whole package needs to be implemented now, not long-grassed to the spring or watered down. More measures are needed, not less.\"\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to reporters while visiting ambulance workers in Lincolnshire on Friday, the prime minister insisted the government was doing \"exactly as we said\" in terms of raising the salary threshold for a family visa, but that the process would happen in \"two stages\".\n\nHe confirmed that the threshold would increase from £18,600 to £29,000 from next spring before going to the \"full amount\" in early 2025.\n\n\"So it's exactly what we said we're doing, we're just phasing it over the next year or so,\" he added.\n\nEarlier this month Mr Cleverly outlined a five-point plan to reduce legal migration after net migration hit a record-breaking 745,000 in the year to December 2022.\n\nOther measures announced in the plan include a ban on care workers bringing over their families and raising the minimum salary for a skilled worker visa from £26,200 to £38,700.\n\nMr Cleverly told the Commons last month the government would \"increase the skilled worker earnings threshold by a third to £38,700 from next spring, in line with the median full-time wage for those kinds of jobs\".\n\n'Tail wagging the dog'\n\nThe original plan was criticised by immigration researchers at The Migration Observatory at Oxford University, who warned the new family visa rules could leave British citizens with a foreign partner facing greater restrictions on who they can live with than migrant workers.\n\nIt said the plan to hike the family visa salary threshold to £38,700 could mean that \"in some circumstances, British workers would face more restrictive rules on family than migrant workers in the same job\".\n\nLabour's shadow international development secretary Lisa Nandy said the backtracking was \"just another example of the tail wagging the dog\" and accused the government of \"running scared of its own back benches\".\n\nAsked whether the party would allow the rise to go ahead if it wins the next election, Ms Nandy said Labour had been \"clear all along that immigration policy has to be aligned with skills\" to address shortages here in the UK.\n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said ministers \"failed to consult anyone on their new proposals and took no account of the impact of steep spousal visa changes on families next year, so it's no surprise they are now rowing back in a rush\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats suggested the planned £38,700 threshold had always been \"unworkable\", with the party's home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael branding it \"yet another half-thought-through idea to placate the hardliners on their own back benches\".\n\nRwanda policy troubles\n\nAs well as seeking to reduce legal migration, the government has made stopping small boat crossings in the Channel a core part of its strategy to reduce illegal migration.\n\nTo achieve that aim, the government wants to deport asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by irregular means to Rwanda.\n\nMr Sunak saw off a rebellion over the plan earlier this month, but further battles are likely to await him in the new year as right-wing Tories demand the bill goes further while those on the moderate wing have warned Mr Sunak that he risks losing their support if he significantly alters the bill to placate the right.\n\nAs well as deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, the government has sought to manage the high number of people arriving by small boat by housing them in former military bases - including the Catterick Garrison in his own constituency of Richmond.\n\nHowever, there have been reports in the Times that the Home Office had assessed the garrison as unsuitable for a large asylum facility.",

        "articleBody": "For eight years, Sophia* has been living a double life. She is not cheating on her husband and isn't doing anything illegal, but her clandestine activities are something she plans with military precision to avoid getting caught.\n\nSophia, who is in her early 30s and lives in north London, is hiding her secret in plain sight. She is one of the hundreds of thousands of Brits who get non-surgical cosmetic treatments every year and lip filler is her beautifier of choice. But her husband doesn't know.\n\nWelcome to the world of cosmetic infidelity.\n\nIt started with a small amount of filler in her top lip. Then she had to go back to discreetly top it up. Before she knew it, she was hooked. She has a separate bank account, which helps cover her tracks, and she plans appointments around her husband's football practice. She makes sure they're first thing in the morning, in the hope the swelling will reduce by the evening. But it's not always easy to keep it secret.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what time of day you get lip filler, by the evening you look like a baboon's backside,\" she says.\n\nSophia just needs 24 hours or so for the swelling in her lips to subside, leaving her with a plump but natural-looking pout. But in that tricky transition period? \"I get into bed and pretend I have period pains while covering my mouth under the duvet in the dark, with just the TV on.\"\n\nHonesty is not an option, she says, as her husband has made it clear he is against cosmetic treatments. \"Or so he thinks,\" she adds, recalling him telling her how pretty she looked after one procedure. \"I think men assume you'll look over-filled and I can't be bothered to argue. I'd rather hide it, it's a lot easier.\"\n\nWhether it's Botox, fillers or other injectables, there are lots of Brits giving their natural beauty a helping hand with \"tweakments\" - but the majority, according to practitioners, are keeping it secret from their partner or other significant people in their lives. While most people in relationships tell the odd white lie here and there, is hiding the truth about cosmetic work a betrayal of trust - or is it a case of your body, your business?\n\nJustifying the money was one of the reasons given by the secret tweakers we spoke to. Injectables don't come cheap in a cost of living crisis, with the NHS saying prices vary from about £100 to £350, depending on the clinic and the area being treated.\n\nThere's also societal pressure, especially on women, to look effortlessly wrinkle-free - but do this naturally, please. And so the occasional post-treatment bump or bruise might be blamed on children, pets or cupboard doors - one woman even convinced her husband he had injured her in his sleep.\n\nOnce a preserve of the rich and famous, an estimated 900,000 Botox injections are now carried out in the UK each year, according to the government. Skin boosters, which hydrate and add moisture, are also growing in popularity, and a recent report in a British plastic surgery journal predicted the UK injectables market will reach a value of £11.7bn by 2026.\n\nThe world is becoming more open about it, with influencers often filming their treatments to show how it all works. Love Island star Zara McDermott and former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh are among the British influencers who have been open about their injectables.\n\nAnd yet, for many of those investing in these treatments there is still a stigma attached to it.\n\nPamela*, a 34-year-old mum from southwest London, has Botox in her forehead and between her eyebrows. For years, she kept it secret from her husband, including when they lived abroad in a country where treatments weren't always up to scratch.\n\n\"Sometimes my husband would look at me like he knew something was different but he couldn't identify what,\" she says. \"And these were not good Botox jobs either.\" On one occasion, she says she was left looking like Dr Spock. \"My eyebrows shot up... it was so bad, an absolute shocker.\"\n\nStill, even with vampiric brows, she managed to hide it. Her husband had previously told her she would be wasting money and that she \"didn't need it\". So she always paid cash. \"I couldn't leave a trail,\" she explains.\n\nOnce after a less successful trip to her injector she was left with bruising so bad that no amount of make-up could cover it up. \"I convinced my husband he'd elbowed me in the middle of the night and given me a black eye,\" she says. \"He felt so bad about it.\"\n\nDr Rina Bajaj, a London-based relationship and counselling psychologist, says honest communication is crucial in any relationship - but individuals also have the right to make choices about their bodies.\n\n\"In relationships that value individual freedom and independence, these choices may be seen as personal and not necessarily shared information,\" she says. \"But, in a different kind of relationship, one partner discovering the other has been keeping cosmetic procedures a secret can break trust.\"\n\nUnderstanding the motivations behind the secrecy is important, she adds, as if fear of judgement or negative reactions from a partner is a driving factor, it could be indicative of underlying issues.\n\nBut fellow behavioural psychologist and relationship coach Jo Hemmings says keeping small cosmetic procedures secret from a partner is an omission rather than a lie. \"It's not a betrayal of trust because you're doing it for yourself,\" she says. \"You're not deceiving somebody else in the way you would be if you were cheating.\"\n\nEven the A-listers are doing it. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman has previously said she tried Botox and \"LOVED IT\" in an interview with The Times in 2015, but admitted to initially keeping it from her husband. \"For about six months he kept saying, 'Hello, Pretty!',\" she told the newspaper. When she eventually told him, \"he found it hilarious\".\n\nBotox and other skin boosters remain a complicated issue for many. For every influencer, beauty journalist or celebrity speaking openly about their cosmetic work, there are more insisting their never-ageing faces are down to the magic formula of drinking lots of water and mindfulness.\n\nPaula*, a 43-year-old mum from Hertfordshire, started getting Botox for her \"Gordon Ramsay\" frown lines after discovering some friends had been doing it \"for years\". After her first treatment, she was nervous her husband would notice, but he didn't. \"I panic every time but he's not the most observant.\"\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Anna, 40, is open about her Botox and fillers with her husband but doesn't volunteer the information to friends. \"I try not to do the school run for the next couple of days,\" she says. \"Maybe because I'm a mum, there's a kind of pressure to dress a certain way and not enhance yourself.\"\n\nWhile practitioners say it is more common for women to keep their treatments hidden, there are a fair few male patients telling white lies about their beauty habits.\n\nSimon*, a 60-year-old man who lives in the home counties, has been with his partner for 24 years. In that time, he has had a cocktail of treatments, including Botox, fillers and BBL (Brazilian Butt Lift), as well as tightening and fat-reducing procedures.\n\nIt's a lot to keep quiet about, but he wants his partner to think his youthful looks are all down to his healthy lifestyle. Is he ever worried about him finding out? \"Not at all, blind as a bat.\"\n\nBut it's not just his partner he keeps it secret from. \"Everyone,\" he says. \"It all looks so natural and I don't have giveaway scars round my ears or missing bits of my face. They just think it's the Peloton and smoothies.\"\n\nEuan Mackinnon, a maxillofacial surgeon and aesthetic doctor who treats cosmetic patients at The Lovely Clinic, has been carrying out tweakments for more than 10 years and says about 70% of clients are keeping it secret from someone.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who are worried about being found out by a partner,\" he says. It is usually women not wanting their husband or boyfriend discovering their secret, because men will give examples of celebrity horror stories, not realising there are hundreds for whom it has gone well. Men fear their partners looking caricature-like, \"with overly inflated lips or frozen foreheads\", he adds. \"In reality, that's not what we do at all.\"\n\nPatients will often tell him excuses they have given for any temporary bruising that might occur immediately after injections. \"You do what you've got to do to get through those first few days. But most treatments don't lead to significant bruising.\"\n\nOn a more serious note, patients are worried about being judged, he says. \"Partners might make them feel like they're being silly or being vain... But you shouldn't feel shameful if you look in the mirror and you just don't like something... if there's a very safe solution to that problem then why not make yourself feel good?\"",

        "articleBody": "Takeaways\n\n    Child exploitation is a horrific crime, and predators are determined criminals who test app, website and platform defenses.\n    In addition to developing technology to tackle this abuse, we hire specialists dedicated to online child safety and we share information with our industry peers and law enforcement.\n    Predators don’t limit their attempts to harm children to online spaces, so it’s vital that we work together to stop predators and prevent child exploitation.\n\nUpdate on January 30, 2024 at 8:10AM PT:\n\nWe’re providing an update on the efficacy of our work enforcing our child safety policies.\n\n    We automatically disable accounts if they exhibit a certain number of the 60+ signals we monitor for potentially suspicious behavior. We identified and removed more than 90,000 accounts from August 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 as a result of this method. \n    From July 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, we reviewed and removed over 21,000 Facebook Groups that violate our child safety policies.\n    Between 2020 and 2023, our teams disrupted 37 abusive networks and removed nearly 200,000 accounts associated with those networks.\n    From August 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, we disabled more than 2.6 million accounts for violating our child sexual exploitation policies. \n    Between August 29 and December 31, 2023, we took action on over 2.2 million accounts on Facebook and over 1.4 million accounts on Instagram, as they were linked to accounts that violated our child safety policies.\n\nOriginally published on December 1, 2023:\n\nPreventing child exploitation is one of the most important challenges facing our industry today. Online predators are determined criminals who use multiple apps and websites to target young people. They also test each platform’s defenses, and they learn to quickly adapt. That’s why now, as much as ever, we’re working hard to stay ahead. In addition to developing technology that roots out predators, we hire specialists dedicated to online child safety and we share information with our industry peers and law enforcement.\n\nWe take recent allegations about the effectiveness of our work very seriously, and we created a task force to review existing policies; examine technology and enforcement systems we have in place; and make changes that strengthen our protections for young people, ban predators, and remove the networks they use to connect with one another. The task force took immediate steps to strengthen our protections, and our child safety teams continue to work on additional measures. Today, we’re sharing an overview of the task force’s efforts to date.\n\nAn Overview of Meta’s Child Safety Task Force\n\nMeta’s Child Safety Task Force focused on three areas: Recommendations and Discovery, Restricting Potential Predators and Removing Their Networks, and Strengthening Our Enforcement.\nRecommendations and Discovery\n\nWe make recommendations in places like Reels and Instagram Explore to help people discover new things on our apps, and people use features like Search and Hashtags to find things they might be interested in. Given we’re making suggestions to people in these places, we have protections in place to help ensure we don’t suggest something that may be upsetting or that may break our rules. We have sophisticated systems that proactively find, remove, or refrain from suggesting content, groups and pages, among other things, that break our rules or that may be inappropriate to recommend to people. Our Child Safety Task Force improved these systems by combining them and expanding their capabilities. This work is ongoing, and we expect it to come into effect fully in the coming weeks. \n\nHere’s what we did:\n\n    We expanded the existing list of child safety related terms, phrases and emojis for our systems to find. We have many sources for these terms, including non-profits and experts in online safety, our specialist child safety teams who investigate predatory networks to understand the language they use, and our own technology which finds misspellings or spelling variations of these terms.\n    We also began using novel techniques to find new terms. For example, we’re using machine learning technology to find relationships between terms that we already know could be harmful or that break our rules and other terms used at the same time. These could be terms searched for in the same session as violating terms, or other hashtags used in a caption that contains a violating hashtag. \n    We combined our systems so that as new terms are added to our central list, they will be actioned across Facebook and Instagram simultaneously. For example, we may send Instagram accounts, Facebook Groups, Pages and Profiles to content reviewers, restrict these terms from producing results in Facebook and Instagram Search, and block hashtags that include these terms on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nRestricting Potential Predators and Removing Their Networks\n\nWe’ve developed technology that identifies potentially suspicious adults, and we review more than 60 different signals to find these adults, such as if a teen blocks or reports an adult, or if someone repeatedly searches for terms that may suggest suspicious behavior. We already use this technology to limit potentially suspicious adults from finding, following or interacting with teens, and we’ve expanded it to prevent these adults from finding, following or interacting with one another. \n\nHere’s what we did:\n\n    On Instagram, potentially suspicious adults will be prevented from following one another, will not be recommended to each other in places like Explore and Reels, and will not be shown comments from one another on public posts, among other things.\n    On Facebook, we’re using this technology to better find and address certain Groups, Pages and Profiles. For example, Facebook Groups with a certain percentage of members that exhibit potentially suspicious behavior will not be suggested to others in places like Groups You Should Join. Additionally, Groups whose membership overlaps with other Groups that were removed for violating our child safety policies will not be shown in Search. As a result of this work, since July 1, 2023, we removed more than 190,000 Groups from Search.\n    We also hire specialists with backgrounds in law enforcement and online child safety to find predatory networks and remove them. These specialists monitor evolving behaviors exhibited by these networks – such as new coded language – to not only remove them, but to inform the technology we use to proactively find them. Between 2020 and 2023, our teams disrupted 32 abusive networks and removed more than 160,000 accounts associated with those networks.\n\nStrengthening Our Enforcement\n\nThe task force also made a series of updates to strengthen our reporting and enforcement systems, and found new ways to root out and ban potentially predatory accounts. In August 2023 alone, we disabled more than 500,000 accounts for violating our child sexual exploitation policies.\n\n    We announced our participation in Lantern, a new program from the Tech Coalition that enables technology companies to share a variety of signals about accounts and behaviors that violate their child safety policies. Lantern participants can use this information to conduct investigations on their own platforms and take action.\n    We audited our systems and fixed technical issues we found, including an issue that unexpectedly closed user reports.\n    We improved the systems we use to prioritize reports for content reviewers. For example, we’re using technology designed to find child exploitative imagery to prioritize reports that may contain it.\n    We introduced additional ways to proactively find and remove accounts that may violate our child safety policies. For example, we’re sending Instagram accounts that exhibit potentially suspicious behavior to our content reviewers and we’ll automatically disable these accounts if they exhibit enough of the 60+ signals we monitor. More than 20,000 accounts were identified and automatically removed in August 2023 as a result of this method.\n    We provided new guidance and tools to help content reviewers understand the latest behaviors and terms used by predators, in many different languages. For example, content reviewers will now see information about coded terms used in posts they’re reviewing to understand the subtext of those terms, and how they’re used by predators. This will help content reviewers better recognize this behavior and take action. \n    We made improvements to better find and remove Instagram accounts and Facebook Profiles that may be linked to those that violate our child safety policies – and to prevent them from creating new accounts from their device. Since the beginning of August, we automatically blocked more than 250,000 devices on Instagram for violations of our child safety policies, and improvements in device blocking have led to more than 10,000 additional enforcements on Instagram and Facebook per day.\n\nWe improved our proactive detection of potentially suspicious Facebook Groups and updated our protocols and review tooling so our reviewers can remove more violating Groups. Since July 1, 2023, we reviewed and removed 16,000 Groups for violations of our child safety policies.\nAfter launching a new automated enforcement effort in September, we saw five times as many automated deletions of Instagram Lives that contained adult nudity and sexual activity.\nWe actioned over 4 million Reels per month, across Facebook and Instagram globally, for violating our policies.",

As the old saying goes, it happens two ways: gradually and then suddenly. And as we close out a wild 12 months of technological progress, I think it’s fair to say that 2023 has been a “suddenly” kind of year.   \n\nLast month we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of FAIR, our Fundamental AI Research lab. When we launched it in 2013 there was tremendous excitement across the industry about the role AI would play in the future, and early machine learning applications were already playing a central role across Facebook. Few could have imagined back then just how impressive the progress would be. In fact, even just two years ago many might have questioned it.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, another big milestone is coming up: it will be 10 years since Meta began working on the computing platform of the future at Reality Labs. These two emerging technologies — AI and the metaverse—represent Meta’s biggest long-term bets on the future. And in 2023 we began to see these two technological pathways intersect in the form of products accessible to huge numbers of people.\n\nAI\n\nOne of the highlights of the year was seeing the way Llama and Llama 2 were embraced by the developer community, with more than 100 million downloads and constant improvements coming from organizations across the world as they iterate. In India, Jio quickly fine-tuned it to build a new tool for serving their more than half a billion customers. And HuggingFace’s Open LLM Leaderboard has filled up with impressive projects built on Llama 2 that are leading the way. These are just a handful of the more than 13,000 Llama variants hosted there. \n\nLike any new technology, AI will have the most impact when it’s available to everyone. It wasn’t that long ago that being able to generate beautiful images using text prompts was effectively inaccessible to most people. But today we’re adding tools like collaborative image generation, conversational assistants, writing helpers, and smart image editors into products already used by billions of people around the world.\n\nA Platform Shift\n\nThe shift we have seen over the last year suggests there is a path to AI becoming a primary way that people interact with machines. The stage is set for new kinds of devices that can perceive, understand, and interact with the world around us in ways that have never been possible before. \n\nOur AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses show one such path. Our new Meta AI assistant combines vision and language understanding to see the world from your perspective and work with you to make sense of it. And we’re testing new multimodal AI capabilities on the glasses. With this enabled, they can translate a foreign language you’re trying to read,  or come up with a funny caption for a photo you’ve taken. And they can do it all hands free, without you needing to pull out a phone or operate an app.  \n\nWe believe one of the most powerful manifestations of cutting-edge AI will be assistants that can understand the world around you and help you throughout your day, eventually without needing to be prompted. Glasses are the ideal form factor for this — they can see and hear the world from your point of view, they’re already socially acceptable, they’re wearable all day, and they let you stay fully present in the moment.\n\nAt Reality Labs, we’ve invested in years of research into the technologies needed to advance this — things like ultra low-power, always-on sensors and machine perception systems capable of understanding your context. We’re not just pioneering a new kind of device here — we’ll be pushing it forward for years to come. \n\nMixed reality and spatial computing represent another path forward. These aren’t simply incremental improvements on the personal computing paradigm that has dominated for the last 50 years. They represent a fundamental shift that’s just beginning to come into focus. \n\nMaking these new technologies available to as many people as possible has been a top priority for Reality Labs for many years now, so releasing the first mass-market mixed reality headset this September was another 2023 highlight for us. \n\nWithin months of the Meta Quest 3 launch, seven of the top 20 apps are mixed reality apps. We’re seeing strong signals that people really value these experiences. There are already hundreds of mixed reality apps in our store where a majority of users have tried mixed reality features. Seeing what happens when lots of people get their hands on a new technology like this has been delightful:\n\nWe’ll see this progress accelerate in 2024 as more people access mixed reality and developers learn to harness its power. Whether it’s immersive NBA viewing on Xtadium or a totally new approach to learning music on Pianovision, we’re already seeing MR deliver experiences that would be impossible on any other kind of device.\nThe Long View\n\nMaking long-term bets on emerging technologies isn’t easy. It’s not guaranteed to work, and it’s certainly not cheap. It’s also one of the most valuable things a technology company can do — and the only way to remain relevant over the long run. Seeing Meta’s two biggest long-term technological bets both mature and intersect this year has been an extremely powerful reminder of the importance of maintaining a healthy investment in future technologies. And it has given us an even clearer view of the innovation we need to deliver over the coming decade. \n\nIn AI, this means full steam ahead on what’s next: what comes after today’s generation of LLMs and generative AI? Most researchers agree that there’s still plenty of opportunity to build bigger and better language, image, and video models with the technologies we have today. But there are still fundamental breakthroughs and entirely new architectures to be discovered, and our AI research teams at Meta are on track to discover them.  \n\nThis means ongoing research into areas like embodied AI, which aims to build models that experience the world the way humans do. The path toward human-level AI, our researchers believe, will require systems that have a deeper understanding of how the world works, and our teams are already making progress on this, with years of work still to come. \n\nAnd at Reality Labs, our researchers are pushing ahead on some of the most promising technologies that will make the next computing platform possible. Over the years this research has led to breakthroughs like the pancake lenses on Quest Pro and Quest 3 and the amazing Codec Avatars prototype that Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Fridman tried out this year. That’s just the tip of the iceberg, and Reality Labs’ research breakthroughs will enable us to release a string of industry-first products over the coming years. \n\nBut of all the things I’ve mentioned here, the most valuable technologies are the ones that are in people’s hands today. The progress made in 2023 means generative AI is making its way into the heart of the world’s most popular apps, mixed reality is now at the core of a mass-market headset, and smart glasses will let AI see the world from our perspective for the first time. This is an extremely exciting time to be building the future. More importantly, it’s a great time to be living in it.",

        "title": "Will It Ever Snow in New York City Again?",
        "authors": "Benjamin Hart",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Remember snow? Merriam-Webster defines it as “precipitation in the form of small white ice crystals formed directly from the water vapor of the air at a temperature of less than 32°F.” It would be understandable if you needed a refresher because, aside from a few flurries, snow has gone missing in New York City for almost two entire years. The meteorologist John Homenuk, who runs the popular New York Metro Weather, is acutely aware of this crisis. The company’s popular and playful social-media accounts — which give each day a weather rating of 1 to 10 — feature a “Snow Meter” that has been delivering only bad news. Yet Homenuk remains bullish on this winter’s wintry possibilities post-December. I spoke with him about the role El Niño plays in anomalous warmth, the accuracy of long-term forecasting, and why January and February may be different.\n\nWe spoke almost a year ago about the lack of snow in recent New York City history. It had been 316 days at that point, which seemed like a lot. Now, we’re at a previously unfathomable 670+ days without measurable snowfall. Do you think we’re being punished by some higher power?\nI was joking around with my family a couple of days ago. I forget who it was who told me, “This is what you get for complaining about snow all the time.” Now there’s none of it ever. So yeah, I can’t remember anything like this. Obviously, the previous record was 380-something days. Like you said, it’s unfathomable, and it’s unheard of for New York City, where records go back to the 1890s.\n\nI’ve been tracking your forecasts carefully, and I know this Christmas period will be anomalously warm here and in most of the country. There’s no hope of any wintry precipitation on the near-term horizon, but do you see any longer-term or medium-term trends that may foster a better environment for it?\n?Right now, we are obviously in a pretty horrendous pattern for snow. There’s really not a whole lot of cold to be found in much of the Northern Hemisphere. We are at the mercy of the Pacific jet stream, and really what it means is that mild Pacific air is just flowing into Canada and the United States. So for the next two weeks, taking us into the first couple days of January, there really isn’t much hope for anything. But I will say — and this is not meant to be a pat on the back for ourselves or anything — it was well agreed upon in the community that this was the winter forecast. December was supposed to be warm, we were not supposed to see much snow, and that’s exactly what happened. In my mind, the narrative will probably begin to change a bit as we get into the middle part of January. That’s when I think there will be some opportunities — the second half of January, in particular, and then into February. I don’t think we’ll go through a whole other winter with a shutout.Mid-January is obviously really far out there, but there are lots of indications pointing us in a direction where the second half of the winter will turn this around.\n\nCan you get into a little more detail on what might change between now and then?\n?Yeah, we are in what’s called a “jet extension,” which is really as simple as it sounds. The Pacific jet stream is always there, but right now, it just happens to be very strong and very extended. It extends almost from eastern Asia to the West Coast of the United States. So you have all that momentum pushing all this mild air into the United States and negating any cold. So all of Canada and all of the United States through late December are forecast to be well above normal in terms of temperatures, and there’s not much to fight that.But as we move into early January, the models take it back into another phase of that jet, which is called the “retraction.”\n\nIt’s kind of like a rubber band: The jet extends all the way out and then it snaps back, and all the waves from that jet stream disperse out. When the jet retracts, that allows other things that are acting on the weather to come back into control. And so our thought process here is that right now, everything is superheated and extended and we have all this mild air flowing in, but once that jet retracts, eventually we could start getting back to a more normal pattern where we have cold air to our north and an active storm track. In very simple terms, that’s how we see this going through mid-January.\n\nPeople say not to trust forecasts more than a few days out, but do these long-term predictions about the jet stream tend to be fairly accurate in the macro sense? They work in a different way, of course. \n?It’s like you said: macro. We’re working in more simplistic terms. You can’t look at a 21-day forecast and expect to get the temperature right down to the degree, but when we’re looking at jet streams and overall patterns, below and above normal, we can do that with some accuracy. We knew a month and a half ago that December was going to be warm. That was pretty well agreed upon. And especially two weeks or so ago, the models really started picking up on this jet extension. But I think there’s good agreement now as we head into mid-January that will open the door for some change.\n\nAnd the narrative in my mind — sort of the bird’s-eye view of this forecast since we started putting pen to paper in October — has been that it’s going to be really bleak to start but the second half of the winter could be really fun if you like snow. When we get our first big snowstorm here this winter, I think most people are going to be so excited, like jumping for joy. It has been so long, and so I am just so pumped — I have a plan in place already. We’re going to do a livestream. It’s going to be awesome.\n\nYou’re going to be breaking viewership records with that one.\n?And I’m just waiting. Every day I look at the weather models and I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nYou really have capitalized on all this — you’re selling merch with the slogan “It used to snow here.” \n?Yeah, it’s really fun. The community has been great the past couple of months. It rains every weekend and we haven’t seen snow, but people are putting the stickers on their water bottles. It’s super-humbling and really cool.\n\nGoing back to the science — it’s an El Niño year, and I’m wondering about the role that plays in all this. Does it have much to do with the jet-stream stuff and the overall warmth? \nYes and no. With El Niño, we’re looking at the impacts of waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, so it’s far away from here. When I talk about El Niño at the Christmas dinner table, I start losing people. But the way to think about it really is that if you have much warmer waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean, the locations of your thunderstorms change and the frequency of those storms changes. And all those storms — those intense thunderstorms there — they feed back into the weather pattern. They impact the weather around them. And El Niño in its own right tends to feature these kinds of jet extensions. That’s just one of its characteristics. So we are following the playbook for an El Niño winter here. And I look back at this winter — not that it’s a comparison right now but because it’s an example of how things can flip — the 2015-to-2016 winter was El Niño. It was very warm early on and very boring until mid-January and then we got a blizzard.\n\nSo I would say the way I would look at El Niños here in New York is that they tend to be really, really slow starters in terms of winters. So we’ll have to be patient, and it definitely is having an effect. But I don’t think it’s impacting our day-to-day weather. I can’t look at this warmth right now and say, “This is a direct effect of El Niño.” It’s more like the El Niño leads to things that then affect our weather, is the best way I can put it.\n\nYou were careful last year to say there’s not a one-to-one connection between climate change and this snowless streak. A lot of it is just luck.\n?Yeah, a hundred percent. I mean, there’s a little bit of luck, and I want to be careful with proclaiming or declaring anything. And we have seen snowless periods in the past; we’ve seen periods of time where snow was below average for several years. But we’ve never quite seen this. This, statistically in and of itself, is very significant, and I don’t think that should be downplayed at all.\n\nDo any of the longer-term trends you’re looking at say much about weather patterns beyond the winter? Last summer wasn’t blazingly hot and was mostly tolerable by New York standards. \n?Well, yes and no. What I can say is that a lot of the climate models and some of the indications we have based on ongoing data are that the El Niño will start to weaken as we head into the spring. Right now, we’re at about moderate intensity. And there’s very strong agreement now among the recent modeling that it will start to weaken substantially, almost to neutral conditions, by the summer. So what that means for us is we’re going back into a period of transition and uncertainty.\n\nThat’s true of the country at large, by the way. You can just use that as a general national forecast. \n?For everyone. But yes, and even from a weather standpoint, it creates a lot of uncertainty as to how the entire weather pattern is going to behave. Whenever you transition out of El Niño or La Niña and you have a rapid change, everything gets shuffled, so the models are all over the place and the confidence is very low. The main indication is that it’s going to be super-uncertain for a while.\n\nIt lets you off the hook in a way. Anything could happen.\n?I guess. It’s just kicking the can down the road, though. Eventually, we have to put a forecast out. Hopefully, we’ll have more clarity on that — as we’re digging out of our February blizzard.",

        "articleBody": "A teenage hacker was sentenced by a judge in the United Kingdom to an indefinite sentence for his role in the hack of Rockstar Games, the video-game company behind the Grand Theft Auto series.\n\nThe BBC reports that Arion Kurtaj, an 18-year-old from Oxford, was sentenced on Thursday to an indefinite period at a hospital, to be released only when doctors find that he is no longer a danger. Because Kurtaj has acute autism, doctors determined that the jury that heard his trial earlier this year would only determine if he committed the crime — not if he had criminal intent.\n\nThe unusual sentencing is the latest twist in the unapproved release last year of clips from the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI. According to prosecutors, Kurtaj was part of a cybercriminal group called Lapsus$, which was also responsible for hacks last year of Microsoft and Uber. Out on bail for allegedly hacking the hardware company Nvidia, Kurtaj, prosecutors say, pulled off the GTA heist while staying under police protection at a Travelodge hotel. Without his computer, he somehow managed to hack into Rockstar using his smartphone, an Amazon Firestick, and the TV in his hotel room. BBC reports that the judge on the case found that Kurtaj’s skill set and willingness to keep hacking while on parole suggested that he remained a risk; prosecutors also stated that he was violent while in custody, causing injury and property damage.",

        "authors": "Charlie Savage",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "The Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling that Donald J. Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run for president again pits one fundamental value against another: giving voters in a democracy the right to pick their leaders versus ensuring that no one is above the law.\n\nMr. Trump’s status as the Republican front-runner for the presidential nomination, despite his role in the events that culminated in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has created severe tensions between those two principles. If the court’s legal reasoning is correct, obeying the rule of law produces an antidemocratic result.\n\nThat constitutional and political dilemma is likely to land before the U.S. Supreme Court. And while Mr. Trump’s name would stay on the primary ballot as the justices weighed the matter, their decision would have consequences far beyond his opportunity to win Colorado’s 10 Electoral College votes.\n\nFor one, similar legal challenges to Mr. Trump’s eligibility are pending in at least 16 additional states. Moreover, the precedent the case will set could open or shut the door to the risk that partisans will routinely turn to state courts to try to keep major federal candidates off the ballot.\n\nSupreme Court justices have life tenure in the hope that their work will be independent of political influence, and, under the principle of the rule of law, it would be illegitimate for them to torque their interpretation of the Constitution with an eye toward political consequences. Under the rule of law, the Constitution and federal statutes apply equally to everybody, and no one’s power, wealth, political influence or other special status puts him or her above the law.\n\nBut under the principle of democracy, the government’s legitimacy stems from the fact that voters decided whom to put in charge. The prospect of unelected judges denying voters the opportunity to make their own decision about Mr. Trump’s political future has given pause even to some of his critics who fervently hope Americans will reject him at the ballot box.\n\nStephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that even if one thinks that Mr. Trump’s actions rendered him unfit for office in line with the 14th Amendment, there are other — and less alarmingly novel — systems that could have addressed that problem before it reached the courts. These would have freed the Republican Party to have a starkly different primary contest, he said.\n\n“The problem is that we’re just not set up for this — we’ve run through the safety nets,” Mr. Vladeck said. “We’ve been spared from this problem in the few prior episodes where it could have arisen by different sets of constraints. And so now we’re in this position because those backstops have failed.”\n\nHad nine more Republican senators voted to convict Mr. Trump at his Jan. 6 impeachment trial, he would be ineligible to hold future office anyway, said Mr. Vladeck, who wrote a column about the complications of the Colorado court’s ruling titled “The Law and High Politics of Disqualifying President Trump.” And if more Republican voters were repelled by Mr. Trump’s attempt to secure an unelected second term, his political career would be over as a practical matter.\n\nThe legal dispute turns on a clause of the 14th Amendment, which was added to the Constitution after the Civil War. Its third section says that people who betrayed their government oaths by engaging in an insurrection are ineligible to hold office. Citing Mr. Trump’s actions surrounding the Jan. 6. riot, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that he was an oath-breaking insurrectionist whose name could not lawfully appear on the ballot.\nImage\n\n“If the language is clear and unambiguous, then we enforce it as written,” a four-justice majority wrote.\n\nBut even if a majority of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court privately agree that the disqualification clause, by its plain text, seems clearly to bar Mr. Trump from returning to government power, it will not be surprising if they hesitate at the prospect of issuing a ruling affirming the Colorado court’s decision.\n\nIf the justices want to overturn the Colorado ruling, they will have numerous potential offramps. Mr. Trump’s lawyers will have technical arguments, like whether the clause in question has legal force by itself or whether Congress would first need to enact a statute for it take effect. His lawyers will also have substantive arguments, like denying that the mob violence of Jan. 6 rose to the level of an “insurrection” in the constitutional sense.\n\nThe dilemma invites comparisons to the Supreme Court’s intervention in the 2000 election, which overruled Florida’s Supreme Court and ensured that George W. Bush would maintain his narrow lead over Al Gore in that state to win its Electoral College votes and become the next president.\n\nA similarity is the risk of the appearance of partisanship. In the Bush v. Gore case, the five most conservative justices ensured that the Republican candidate would prevail. Today, the U.S. Supreme Court is controlled by a supermajority of six Republican appointees, so a decision to overturn the Colorado ruling and help Mr. Trump could also carry partisan overtones.\n\nA difference is the implications for democracy. The Florida Supreme Court in 2000 was not itself deciding the fate of the candidates but trying to allow the completion of a recount that would have clarified the will of voters. If the Supreme Court now overturns the Colorado ruling, it will be leaning in the direction of letting voters decide about Mr. Trump; upholding the state court’s ruling would be the opposite.\n\nThere has always been inherent tension in the American governing system because the Constitution sets certain limits on democracy. For one, most decisions are made by elected representatives, not directly by plebiscites and referendums.\n\nThe structures of the Senate and the Electoral College system undercut the democratic principle that everyone has an equal say by giving disproportionate power to voters in sparsely populated states — including sometimes enabling the loser of the national popular vote, like Mr. Bush in 2000 and Mr. Trump in 2016, to nevertheless become president.\n\nNot everyone who lives in the United States is allowed to vote for government leaders. Noncitizen permanent residents, people under 18 and convicted felons in some states may not participate in elections — all of which conflicts with the principle that the legitimacy of the government stems from the consent of the governed about who will be in charge.\n\nOther requirements restrict who is eligible to hold office. The 22nd Amendment bars anyone from being elected president a third time, even if voters want to keep that person in place. It was added after President Franklin D. Roosevelt violated the constitutional norm of retiring after two terms, which President George Washington had established.\n\nThe Constitution sets age limits: One must be at least 25 years old to be a member of the House, 30 to be a senator and 35 to be president, even if voters would prefer someone who happens to be younger.\n\nAnd the Constitution dictates that to be eligible to be president, a person must be a natural-born citizen. The antidemocratic nature of that rule drew some attention when the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a naturalized citizen who was born in Austria, was elected governor of California. He could never run for president, no matter how popular he was with voters.\n\nThe issue of citizenship at birth has also been the subject of political attention. When Senator John McCain ran as the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, there were questions at the fringes about whether he was eligible because he had been born in the Panama Canal Zone, although to American parents.\n\nMr. Trump’s rise to national political prominence was fueled by his lie that President Barack Obama, who was born in Hawaii, might have been born in Kenya. And in the 2016 Republican primary, Mr. Trump attacked a rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, over his birth in Canada, similarly seeking to raise doubts about his eligibility for the presidency.\n\nBut, despite Mr. Trump’s own history of questioning the eligibility of his political adversaries for president, his legal disqualification would risk undermining democratic legitimacy in a society where extreme polarization and partisanship are already raw.\n\nThe moment calls to mind an ambiguous legal phrase that is often invoked as a rallying cry for courageously following the law but, as Mr. Vladeck pointed out, also carries a grim warning: “Let justice be done though the heavens fall.”",

        "articleBody": "My mom raised hell at her Catholic high school in the 1950s. Carol smoked, skipped class and talked back to Mother Bourke, the formidable headmistress. Whenever the nuns asked her to rat on a fellow student or admit to some suspected sin, she’d reply, “My father says I don’t have to do that,” upon which Mother Bourke would send her home to her father.\n\nAt Mom’s 50th birthday party, her best friends from school, Cynthia and Mary, gave her a little notecard in a silver frame. The card read, “Very good” — in the style and with the school insignia of the good conduct notes that Mother Bourke handed out to the best behaved. Mom said she had been a “no-notes girl”: a student who never got a card because she acted fresh.\n\nWhen I came along, adopted by my parents when they were in their mid-30s, Mom gave me two godmothers, Cynthia and Mary, and my baptism was a big family affair. She said she fell in love with me at first sight, that I was “an A-plus baby” and there was so much love going around that she couldn’t pick just one godmother. Photos from the baptism show me being passed from woman to woman to woman and back again and again at the altar of our local parish, St. Frances.\n\nMom took me to St. Frances on Sundays as a kid. I liked the Gospel stories and the music, and shaking hands with neighbors during the sign of peace. I liked praying and thinking that Jesus was looking out for me. When I got fidgety, Mom widened her eyes and pursed her lips into a silent glare; it made me laugh and then shut me up.\n\nWhat I liked most about church was that it was our thing together, mine and my mom’s; my dad golfed on Sundays, and my brother, Gerry, who was 11 years older than me, didn’t like Catholicism or the lecturing priests. Later at home, my brother would crack Mom and me up by imitating the priests delivering sermons about “the sins of the flesh” and other allusions to sex or bad behavior. I imagined Mom saw these priests as she saw Mother Bourke all those years ago: rigid, humorless, out of touch with the ways regular people lived their lives.\n\nBut Christmas morning was special. All four of us got dressed up and went to church together. My brother would make jokes under his breath throughout Mass about the prissy-looking choir. My parents couldn’t contain their laughter. I loved it, too, but I was also the most serious of the four of us, even as a kid, and I always felt bad during the Gospel story when Mary and Joseph got the cold shoulder at the inn.\n\nAs a teenager, I slowly stopped going to church. I was becoming a little more withdrawn, preferring to be alone, watching television, writing plays and short stories. I had started developing little crushes on boys my age; I would prank call the same boy in my grade every few days, hanging up the phone when I heard his voice. I felt bad about myself. My dad had told me stories about a man who tried to molest him at a movie when he was a boy, and in my house there were a lot of jokes and put-downs about “fags” and “fairies.” My mother once spotted me standing with my wrists pressing into my hips, my hands flared back, and said, “Only sissies stand like that.” I was nervous for a long time that they might send me back to the adoption agency if they found out I had crushes on boys, so I kept it to myself.\n\nMy parents enrolled me in an all-boys Catholic high school in Boston, and if I was never the cool rebel Mom was, I found my own great friends, as she did. Cynthia and Mary had shown me how friendship can be the best thing in life; Mom often spoke about how they’d seen her through hard times, when she was trying to carry other babies to term after my brother. The only acting out I did was weirder and darker than what Mom did, like when I once sneaked into St. Frances and up to the altar and ate some of the communion wafers from a chalice. I got used to keeping secrets about my feelings. Mom and Gerry were cool; I saw myself, some of the time, as just bad.\n\nThe priests were no help. In classes and assemblies some would say there were “no homosexual boys” at our high school. I started trying to ignore my attraction to boys and focused on dating girls — preoccupied with the idea of marrying someday and having my own children. I knew this was Mom’s wish for me; she missed having a big family and talked about getting grandchildren someday. If she sensed that I might never marry a woman, she never said it to me. But years later, my godmother Cynthia told me that when I was a teenager, she told Mom she thought I might be gay. They fought about it, until Mom said, “How would you feel if your son was gay?” Then they ended the call. They didn’t speak for months after that, Cynthia said.\n\nIt did not occur to me in high school — this was the late 1980s — that gay people could be in happy relationships, let alone marry. I was too scared to even give it thought. And I didn’t want to be different; I liked knowing how I was an A-plus baby, and I didn’t want to hear again about being a “sissy.” Certainly no priest I knew, including some I was friendly with, ever said a nice thing about a gay person. I couldn’t imagine priests treating a gay couple with dignity and respect.\n\nBut over time I started to imagine that Mom might. I knew she respected me, my loyalty as a son and my work as a journalist, especially when I chose to go to Afghanistan as a reporter after Sept. 11, 2001. I saw her as a freethinker who stood up to Mother Bourke, who laughed at the windy sermons. So when I returned home from Afghanistan at age 30, after a lot of nights there thinking about life and several years into dating men, I decided to tell the truth about myself.\n\nThe conversations started well. I told my brother over dinner, and he was loving. I took my dad for a walk on the beach; “You’re my guy,” he said. That night at home, with Mom cooking and my father at the kitchen table, I told her that I wanted to share something. I struggled a bit, then got the words out. Her back was to me, but I could see the reaction: She hung her head forward, dropped her shoulders, gripped the counter and started to cry. And then walked to another room.\n\nWhen she came back, she said she worried that I would live a lonely life, never have a family, never have a good career, that I would be treated like a “nancy boy.” It was a phrase I didn’t remember hearing before, but of course, I knew what it meant. For whatever reason I thought of the priests saying there were no homosexual boys at school. Respect and acceptance felt a long way away that night; at the kitchen table where I used to listen to Mom, Cynthia and Mary share old stories and laugh, all I felt was sadness.\n\nMom asked for some time to process things. In the years that followed, we talked about who I was and how I knew I was gay and that I was happy being gay. That wasn’t always true: I was sad at the thought that I might not have kids, and I missed the old closeness that Mom and I had shared. She grew more tolerant over time and welcomed my first serious boyfriend, Ray, into my childhood home.\n\nBut I don’t think she ever really accepted who I was. She told me that she didn’t want to tell our relatives about my being gay. And when I told her that I’d asked Ray to marry me, there was no joy, no celebration; a woman whose own curiosity helped inspire me to become a journalist had no follow-up questions about our wedding plans or our life together. She never visited our home. Maybe I sold her short, but I didn’t see the bravery that I admired as a child, and after years of talking to her about who I was, I felt I wasn’t going to get much further.\n\nThe truth is, I also carried some anger: I would’ve liked to have married, with Mom looking on proudly, but I knew that would never be 100 percent true. I once wanted to marry in the church, but that wasn’t in the cards. There were times I wondered: Why didn’t the church respect me for being myself? Why didn’t Mom care more about me than about the image of a nancy boy, the image of the sissy? Why do we sometimes treat others who are lonely and struggling — even our own children — with the cold shoulder?\n\nI hadn’t thought about this much until Monday, when Pope Francis announced that priests could bless same-sex relationships. I wondered how my mother would have felt about the news. Would this new blessing have helped her to accept me more fully? Will it help bridge this tension that so many gay Americans have felt in recent decades — greater acceptance in society but condemnation or disrespect in our own families? I have no doubt that my mother loved me, but I think she needed help accepting me — help the church could have given. I saw the pope’s announcement as an attempt at compassion, something I never thought I’d see from the church for gay couples. I like to think the church under Francis is on an imperfect journey, not unlike the journeys many of us went on with our parents, toward some measure of reconciliation. Respect and acceptance still feel far away, as they did at my old kitchen table, but things feel a little less cold now.\n\nThis is my first Christmas without Mom. She died in March, at age 87. I was her primary caregiver, along with her assisted living team. As she faded into Alzheimer’s over the last five years, her tolerance faded a bit, too. When I told her over lunch that I married last year and showed her my ring, she asked who my wife was. I told her I had a husband and his name was Ray; she widened her eyes and pursed her lips, as she did when I was fidgety in church. I just smiled and said I was happy. She smiled back and said she was glad, and I walked her back to her room.",

        "authors": "",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A family in Wisconsin is beyond devastated after four siblings were killed in a car accident last weekend. Worse, the other car’s driver should never have been on the road that night.\n\nIn a criminal complaint obtained by People, the incident happened shortly after 9:00 p.m. Saturday on Highway 10 in Waupaca County. The Waupaca County Sheriff’s Office claims 47-year-old Scott Farmer was driving his pick-up truck the wrong way down the road, leading him to crash “head-on” with an SUV carrying four people inside. Unfortunately, all four of the other vehicle’s occupants — a group of siblings — were killed. Three of them, identified as 23-year-old Fabian Gonzalez, 14-year-old Lilian Gonzalez, and 9-year-old Daniela Gonzalez, died at the scene. Awful. Waupaca County Capt. Todd G. Rasmussen said in the complaint:\n\nTheir 25-year-old older brother, Daniel Gonzalez, was taken to the hospital for medical treatment following the accident. However, he also succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. Their family told WLUK the brothers took their sisters out as they did every Saturday and were only about three miles away from home when the crash occurred. Absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nAs for the fifth person involved in the crash? The alleged drunk driver, Farmer?\n\nIn the criminal complaint, Rasmussen says he went to check on Farmer after the crash and discovered an open bottle of vodka next to him. The driver then allegedly told law enforcement he only “spun out” and “didn’t hit anybody.” Was he lying? Was he so drunk he sincerely didn’t realize? Rasmussen further alleged Farmer’s “speech was incoherent at times and his sentences would trail off so I could not understand them.” He added that Farmer refused to listen to the cops.\n\nAt one point, the criminal complaint states, Farmer became annoyed and began “threatening to fight” firefighters who were only trying to get him out of the vehicle. As Rasmussen noted in the complaint, “these observations are all indicative of impairment, more specifically impairment caused by consuming alcohol.”\n\nEventually, Farmer claimed down enough so he could be questioned by officers. And when asked what day it was at the time, he said it was February 12. What?! Reminder, this was LAST SATURDAY. December 17. They then asked him how fast he was driving, to which he responded, “(Expletive) 75,” per WLUK. Farmer also admitted he drank “a lot” before the fatal crash. Jeez.\n\nHe ultimately was arrested. Per Waupaca County jail records, Farmer has remained in jail since early Sunday morning. He now faces four charges of homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle. And prepare to get even more infuriated, Perezcious readers. This isn’t the first drunk driving incident Farmer has had!\n\nThe criminal complaint stated that Farmer had four prior convictions for operating a vehicle while intoxicated!\n\nWLUK reported that his driver’s license was even revoked at the time of the crash. He should never have been on the road!\n\nFox 6 reports that during a court appearance on Monday, a judge set Farmer’s bail at $750,000 — even though prosecutor Veronica Isherwood requested it be set at $4 million. And understandably, the family is upset by the amount. The siblings’ stepfather, Kurt Schilling, told WLUK:\n\n“$750,000 after killing four beautiful people’s lives, our children. Where’s the justice in that?”\n\nSchilling further told the outlet that he “cannot express” what his stepkids meant to him, adding:\n\n“All I would say is that he and all people who might drink for many bad reasons, to excess, or other drugs, would be responsible and think of others, because you really destroyed our lives.”\n\nSo, so sad. Their cousin Luis Gonzalez-Quizhpe also noted the bond amount was “an injustice,” writing in a GoFundMe message:\n\n    “My cousins’ life was invaluable. It was priceless. But $750,000 is really an injustice in itself and also an insult to my family because their lives were not worth that little. There will never be an amount that ever reaches the value that my cousins had within our family and within our community.”\n\nAnother GoFundMe page has been created to help the Gonzalez family with the funeral expenses. Gonzalez-Quizhpe said the family plans to hold a funeral in Wisconsin before traveling to Ecuador, where their mother Paulina is from, for their burials.\n\nWhat happened to these four siblings was so terrible… and preventable. Our hearts just break for this family. Reactions, Perezcious readers? Let us know in the comments below.",

        "authors": "Bob Yirka",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A team of chemical engineers and materials scientists at Zhejiang University in China has developed a new type of aerogel fiber that has proven to be warmer than down when woven into a sweater. In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes the inspiration for their fibers, how they were made and how well they worked when tested in a cold environment. Zhizhi Sheng and Xuetong Zhang, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have published a Perspective piece in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.\n\nAerogels are types of gels where the liquid is replaced by air. They were invented in the 1930s and have been used for a variety of applications, including NASA space vehicles. Because of their positive thermal properties, materials scientists have been trying to make fibers using them that could be used to create warm textiles. Thus far, such attempts have mostly failed, however, due to a lack of moisture permeability and strength. In this new study, the research team in China has found a way to overcome both problems.\n\nThe work by the researchers began as an effort to mimic the thermal properties of polar bear fur. They note that the reason the bears can keep warm in such cold temperatures is that the hairs that make up their fur coat have both a porous core and a dense shell. To recreate such attributes, the group created what they describe as an encapsulated aerogel fiber by starting with a precursor, which they spun as it was frozen. This process led to a sol-gel transition. The material was then freeze-dried and coated with a semi-hard shell.\n\nThe result was a thin round fiber that could be produced in desired lengths. The researchers note that no post-processing was needed to produce textiles, suggesting their fibers could be produced more cheaply than those currently in use.\n\nThe research team next produced batches of their fibers in long strands that they used to weave a sweater. They then tested the warmth of the sweater by exposing it to temperatures as low as -20°C. They claim the sweater demonstrated thermal protection that was better than similar sweaters made of down, wool, or cotton. They also stretched the sweater 10,000 times and found it suffered little damage. They also note that the fiber can be stretched, dyed, and flexed.",

        "authors": "University of Tokyo",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "At about the size of a pinkie nail, the jellyfish species Cladonema can regenerate an amputated tentacle in two to three days—but how? Regenerating functional tissue across species, including salamanders and insects, relies on the ability to form a blastema, a clump of undifferentiated cells that can repair damage and grow into the missing appendage.\n\nJellyfish, along with other cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, exhibit high regeneration abilities, but how they form the critical blastema has remained a mystery until now.\n\nA research team based in Japan has revealed that stem-like proliferative cells—which are actively growing and dividing but not yet differentiating into specific cell types—appear at the site of injury and help form the blastema.\n\n\"Importantly, these stem-like proliferative cells in blastema are different from the resident stem cells localized in the tentacle,\" said corresponding author Yuichiro Nakajima, lecturer at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Tokyo. \"Repair-specific proliferative cells mainly contribute to the epithelium—the thin outer layer—of the newly formed tentacle.\"\n\nAccording to Nakajima, the resident stem cells that exist in and near the tentacle are responsible for generating all cellular lineages during homeostasis and regeneration, meaning they maintain and repair whatever cells are needed during the jellyfish's lifetime. Repair-specific proliferative cells only appear at the time of injury.\n\n\"Together, resident stem cells and repair-specific proliferative cells allow rapid regeneration of the functional tentacle within a few days,\" Nakajima said, noting that jellyfish use their tentacles to hunt and feed.\n\nAccording to first author Sosuke Fujita, a postdoctoral researcher in the same lab as Nakajima in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, this finding informs how researchers understand how blastema formation differs among different animal groups.\n\n\"In this study, our aim was to address the mechanism of blastema formation, using the tentacle of cnidarian jellyfish Cladonema as a regenerative model in non-bilaterians, or animals that do not form bilaterally—or left-right—during embryonic development,\" Fujita said, explaining that the work may provide insight from an evolutionary perspective.\n\nSalamanders, for example, are bilaterian animals capable of regenerating limbs. Their limbs contain stem cells restricted to specific cell-type needs, a process that appears to operate similarly to the repair-specific proliferative cells observed in jellyfish.\n\n\"Given that repair-specific proliferative cells are analogs to the restricted stem cells in bilaterian salamander limbs, we can surmise that blastema formation by repair-specific proliferative cells is a common feature independently acquired for complex organ and appendage regeneration during animal evolution,\" Fujita said.\n\n\"It would be essential to introduce genetic tools that allow the tracing of specific cell lineages and the manipulation in Cladonema,\" Nakajima said. \"Ultimately, understanding blastema formation mechanisms in regenerative animals, including jellyfish, may help us identify cellular and molecular components that improve our own regenerative abilities.\"",

        "title": "Inside LA’s Star Garden Strike: Strippers Are Organizing Whether You Like It or Not",
        "authors": "Erin Taylor",
        "date": "2022-08-25",
        "articleBody": "On the evening of August 19th at Actors’ Equity headquarters in North Hollywood, the sun was setting over a mixture of workers, union members and press teams with big black video cameras. There was a sense of excitement and curiosity as the group waited for the speeches to begin. On August 17th Actors’ Equity, the national labor union (associated with AFL-CIO) representing more than 51,000 professional actors and stage actors, had filed a petition for a union recognition election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on behalf of workers at a topless dive bar located off Lankershim Boulevard in NoHo.\n\nThe Star Garden Topless Dive Bar is like any other place where people pay to see naked people, experience various kinds of intimacy, and connect for a moment with a fantasy beyond their grasp. It is a workplace riddled with as many reasons to leave as it is with reasons to stay. Star Garden dancer Charlie described to the Observer why she loved Star Garden, “The reason why all of us are fighting so hard for it: The girls, every single person we worked with, created this community that it felt like a co-op already.” Charlie’s description of this community mimics many in managed spaces; the sex trade cultivates a space of vulnerability, a feeling of survival camaraderie, and is a fertile hotbed for friendship. All of the Star Garden dancers that spoke to the Observer preferred to be identified by their stage names, which is also a common practice at their workplace. \n\nIf the Star Garden workers are recognized as employees (based on the union’s filing with the NLRB) they will be able to participate in a union election. They have been picketing outside of the club since March after being barred from working after raising concerns, so they haven’t technically been Star Garden employees since then, but if they’re found to have been unduly terminated they will become eligible to participate in a vote to certify the union. As the LA Times reported “Most of the dancers involved in the petition said they were barred from entering the club when they showed up for work the next day.” \n\nIt’s not about Amazon and Starbucks\n\nDespite its apparent relevance, the 2019 California law regarding labor classification, AB 5, had nothing to do with the ability of Star Garden workers to unionize, since an earlier law, AB 2509, specifies dancers (or workers generally in “public housekeeping establishments” and the “amusement or recreation industry”) are full-time employees, not independent contractors. A 2000 analysis by the California government regarding the law’s impact states: \n\n“This clarifies situations where dancers may be incorrectly identified as independent contractors and not employees entitled to keep gratuities.” \n\nIt is easy to throw the organizing at Star Garden side by side with the ongoing growing labor movement in the United States, with Amazon (AMZN) and Starbucks as two common organizing targets; however, to do so without nuance ignores a nearly fifty year (if not longer) labor movement specific to sex workers, including erotic dancers. \n\n“When we were listening to the Starbucks and the Amazon union talk, they were like, they’ll take away your benefits. They’ll take away all of this and then like eventually get to your job. I’m like, they didn’t give us that, it just goes straight to being fired,” Charlie said.\n\nThe circumstances behind the union movement at Star Garden have been dreadfully underreported or misreported, but the result is the same. Various reports have described troublesome events such as a customer hugging a worker without permission; non-consensual video recordings by creepy regulars; OSHA violations, and special treatment for one individual who was allowed to stay past the 2 A.M. closing time. The dancers allege that these events occurred leading up to March 18th when the strike began. \n\nA noteworthy exception is Suhauna Hussain’s reporting in the LA Times: “Left to deal with inappropriate behavior from customers on their own, every dancer who spoke with The Times described feeling vulnerable to abuse. All said they had been groped, picked up, smacked, restrained or grabbed by customers without their consent.” This matches what sources told me of their experiences at Star Garden. \n\nLap dance quotas as a weapon\n\nEvery worker I talked to at Star Garden described a hostile work environment where their jobs were constantly threatened, with Charlie emphasizing an arbitrarily applied, and unusually high (for a dive bar), $200 lap dance quota that was used as a weapon whenever management wanted to get rid of a worker. All of the workers I spoke to discussed an outright hostility from management towards staff that included abuse around quotas, surveillance, and hours. Star Garden’s owners have not responded to repeated interview requests by multiple news outlets, including those submitted by the Observer for this piece. \n\nThe sole statement from a Star Garden representative came in July, when the bar’s lawyer spoke to BuzzFeed. Joshua Kaplan denied all misconduct, calling what the dancers have said “maliciously false.” Kaplan did not respond to our questions. \n\nI attended the rally on August 19th at Actor’s Equity, as well as the picket line at Star Garden itself. I spoke to about ten workers and organizers, as well as attendees of the evening. They described a pattern of workplace abuses that they referred to as “the three strikes” (in the baseball sense) that led to the strike (in the labor sense.) While walking twenty feet from the picket line with two workers, I saw Star Garden’s security guard sitting grumpily behind  joyous protesters who were cheering at every honk from supporters driving down the boulevard. We moved to where we could speak openly without surveillance; according to both, it’s not unusual for management at Star Garden to repeat workers’ private conversations back to them as a not-so-subtle reminder that the dancers are always being recorded.\n\nStrike one: A “joke” that was more of a threat\n\nThe first “strike” has been referenced in several news reports, rarely in full; four different Star Garden workers confirmed to the Observer that a worker went to the acting manager on duty to request that a regular client (for those unfamiliar with the jargon, a regular comes regularly but often with special privileges by establishments to encourage that relationship, often at the expense of workers) no longer be allowed to stay past closing. The manager on duty responded by discrediting her concerns, making a “joke” that the regular would harm her if she caused a problem and telling her not to push it. She responded that the “joke” wasn’t really that funny; she was fired for causing problems. This happened despite many workers viewing her as a top earner. \n\nNumerous workers confirmed to me that each and every client reported to management for abusive behavior continued to be welcomed as a regular. Star Garden doesn’t have an in-house black list, a way to keep track of clients who pose a genuine safety risk versus ones who might just smell bad. One worker, May, confirmed to the Observer: “The guy that got the dancer fired for talking about the videotaping thing was a regular. He came in maybe three or four times a week. He was constantly trying to reach over the tip bar and touch us. We all had to talk to each other and say, don’t go near him.” Sex workers keep sex workers safe, Star Garden workers kept Star Garden safe. \n\nStrike two: customers recording without consent\n\nThe second strike was described by Star Garden worker Charlie: “I was on stage dancing and a customer was recording without consent. Another dancer came up because obviously security is not gonna do anything about that. They don’t care, that customer was drinking, making the club money. So they’re not gonna say anything. Another dancer, bless her soul, walked up to him and was like, you can’t record without consent. Put your phone away. Thank God. It turned into a little scene because he was over served. She got fired for ‘starting drama.’”\n\nStrike three: lack of safety\n\nWorkers described an environment where they were discouraged or banned from requesting help from the security guard if they were being assaulted or harassed. A Star Garden worker told me that a member of management told her, “Hey, if you have a problem with a customer, if you’re being assaulted, you can’t go to security, you have to go to a manager.” Charlie told the Observer that “a manager wasn’t always there. And then if you did go to a manager, they’d be like, ‘oh, okay. We’ll review the tapes later.’ As if these tapes later are gonna solve the problem of you getting assaulted right now.” \n\nStoney, an organizer with sex worker advocacy group Strippers United who uses her stage name professionally in her organizing work, informed me at the picket line that after the workers reached out to them seeking advice, they delivered a petition (which according to the LA Times, 15 of the 23 dancers signed) to the management on March 18th. Management locked them out the next day and required one-on-one meetings for any further contact, according to multiple sources. Stoney told me that the first lockout resulted in Star Garden workers and their supporters picketing for eight days straight until it became apparent that the club, like most managed spaces in the sex industry, is dead on weekdays. They only picket weekends now.\n\nAnother organizer with Strippers United, Alice, confirmed to the Observer that after meeting as a collective, the Star Garden workers confronted managers and presumed owners Stepan K. Kazaryan and Yevgenya Jenny Kazaryan (the club’s precise ownership, even on official documents, is murky) with their demands, which didn’t go smoothly. Alice described the management’s response as “we’ll talk to you one-on-one, but we’re not talking to you as a group. And that was it, that was when they decided to strike. Strippers United has been with them ever since.”  \n\nDancers are workers\n\nAt the Actors’ Equity rally someone shouted, “Los Angeles is a union town!” to which the former labor organizer and progressive LA city council candidate Hugo Soto-Martinez shouted back “That’s right, LA is a union town!” Soto-Martinez is taking aim at incumbent Mitch O’Farrell’s seat in Council District 13. “When I heard about the workers here organizing I thought it was an incredible fight because it really shifts the paradigm of what a worker is,” Soto-Martinez told the Observer. “I think that there’s these false concepts that people have about who deserves to have a living wage and who doesn’t.”\n\nDirector of Organizing & Mobilization at Actors’ Equity Stefanie Frey, asked if Actors’ Equity’s move should encourage more strip clubs to seek unionization, responded: “Right now the focus is on the Star Garden contract. I am happy to talk to anyone from the live entertainment industries, who have long been exploited and I really hope that will lead more in the right direction in taking power back in their workplaces.” \n\nDancers’ rights have been a long time coming\n\nErotic workers have been able to form a union for a long time, even before AB 2509 and AB 5, most notably San Francisco’s Lusty Lady in 1996. AB 5, which was primarily about Uber and Lyft drivers, served to clarify that the California state government has been neglecting and not equally enforcing labor protections it established for dancers in 2000. Some sex workers choose to remain independent contractors for their own reasons, but there should be no debate as to whether in a “managed space” (such as a strip club) they’d count as employees or contractors. \n\n“Sex worker unions—including stripper unions—have been around for some time and are not the result of AB5.  In fact AB5 does not affect organizing rights—only wage, unemployment insurance, and workers compensation rights,” University of California law professor Veena Dubal told the Observer.\n\nSex workers have been organizing and the labor movement that currently exists is inclusive of everyone beyond borders yet recognizes everyone operates in unique contexts depending on local prostitution policy. Star Garden is on the verge of joining clubs like Lusty Lady, like Pacers in San Diego (they nearly unionized in 1993), and others in destigmatizing erotic labor. It is important when talking about Star Garden to place it not just in its position in this specific moment in the US labor movement but in the domestic sex workers’ rights movement.\n\nStar Garden illustrates the power workers have when they come together to say enough is enough, even up against the unique complexities of recognizing sex work as labor. No one can reasonably debate in 2022 if sex work is work, if sex workers should be able to form a union (or reject one); if only because they were never asking for your permission. \n\nThis story was updated on August 25.",

        "articleBody": "The annual gathering of the global elite in Davos, Switzerland, says it's tackling the world's problems, but resists efforts at redistributing its wealth.\n\nThe organizers of the World Economic Forum in Davos, which wrapped up its four-day conference today (May 26), have maintained its annual gathering of the global elite was a venue for solving the world’s problems. That claim should always have been viewed with suspicion, said New York Times economic correspondent Peter Goodman. After a global pandemic, massive economic shocks, and the outbreak of war in Europe, “now it seems ridiculous.”\n\nGoodman is the author of Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World. He describes the book, published earlier this year, as a safari of the world’s most powerful people, and Davos as the watering hole where they gather. Davos, he said, is a forum for “billionaires rallying around themselves to convince themselves they are the good guys.”\n\nFor the last 30 years, Davos has worked hard to present itself as promoting constructive action. But according to Goodman, it’s used that cloak of virtue to effectively quash the biggest mechanism for doing good: redistributing wealth. That’s why Dutch historian Rutger Brennan caused such a stir in 2019 when he dared speak the t-word—taxes—in a session about how to solve global inequality. “It feels like I’m at a firefighters conference and no one’s allowed to speak about water,” Bregman said then. “Just stop talking about philanthropy and start talking about taxes.”\n\nAs the global population grows increasingly frustrated with the widening spread between the haves and have-nots—a gap that only grew during the pandemic—it’s harder and harder to view the earnest sentiments of Davos as anything more than elaborate public relations. This year’s conference—held in May and not its customary January because of Covid—made fewer headlines and attracted less attention than previous versions.\n\nBut the end of relevancy won’t mean the end of Davos, Goodman said. At its core, Davos is an opportunity for billionaires, heads of state and CEOs to meet, wheel and deal, and make money.\n\n“The real meaning of Davos has nothing to do with the vows and the pledges,” he said. “It’s a place to get business done.”",

        "articleBody": "Santa Barbara, California—Reclusive and disaffected, Ettore Majorana liked to work in the shadows. But after his friend Emilio Segrè dragged him into Enrico Fermi’s elite Roman physics club in the late 1920s, Majorana’s stature in atomic physics quickly grew. His mostly unpublished premonitions were eerily prescient: Among others, he famously intuited the existence of the neutron from prior experiments. And in 1937, he conjured up a completely new kind of particle. Physicists had learned that every fundamental particle seems to have an antimatter counterpart, an idea Segrè would later earn a Nobel Prize for verifying. Majorana realized the equation that leads to this duality could also describe a single particle with identical matter and antimatter personas, making it prone to annihilate itself.\n\nMonths later, the 31-year-old withdrew a large sum from his bank account, took a boat across the Tyrrhenian Sea, and vanished. To this day, nobody’s sure what happened to him, and the jury is also still out on whether his proposed particle exists. For example, some physicists still believe the neutrino—a wispy particle that pervades the universe—might be its own antiparticle, which could also help explain why the universe is filled with more matter than antimatter. But tests have so far proved inconclusive.\n\nHowever, scientists think they are close to approximating a Majorana particle in a much different guise. By confining electrons on flat surfaces, researchers can coax them into peculiar dances that collectively masquerade as a Majorana particle, much as the undulations of a flock of birds might appear like a swimming fish.\n\nIf this Majorana quasiparticle could be corralled and controlled, the payoff would be twofold. It’s a chance to manifest exotic physics, a thrill on par with smashing out new particles in a collider. More tangibly, the electron dances also promise to fortify quantum computers, transforming the frail devices into practical machines that can realize their promise of vastly speeding up certain computations and simulating the true nature of reality. “It’s such a surprising thing that electrons will do this,” says Charlie Marcus, a University of Washington physicist and veteran of Majorana research. “And if it turns out that it’s really beneficial for quantum computing … that feels like frosting on the cake.”\n\nThe epicenter for the Majorana hunt is here, in this cushy Southern California beach town that has seen an influx of hundreds of well-paid corporate scientists. Inside a stark black building with tinted windows, Google researchers attempt to engineer the quasiparticle on supercooled chips encased in chilling systems that look like chandeliers. Across the parking lot, Microsoft researchers work to lure it to the ends of a wire 1000 times thinner than a strand of hair. Down the street, scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) aim to trap it with pencil lead and Scotch tape. They’re all pretty sure they’ve got it—and that they’re one step ahead of everybody else.\n\nBut like the 85-year hunt for Majorana himself, the field has yet to deliver on tantalizing leads. Contentious false alarms and a muddy mix of corporate and academic interests have left researchers raw and bruised—even as they say they are on the cusp of a breakthrough. “It’s a field that has had some hiccups,” says Jason Alicea, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). “But there’s a lot of new tendrils that are opening up. There’s so much beautiful physics that’s waiting to be revealed.”\n\nAt an atomic level, 2D slices of solid materials can be thought of as giant checkerboards in which the pieces are electrons and the vacant spaces are “holes,” which behave like positively charged electrons. Under the right conditions, the motion of electrons and holes can synchronize to behave as a single quasiparticle, in which fragments of the electron appear as if they are physically separated. These quasiparticles are sometimes dubbed “anyons” for their seeming ability to do anything.\n\nA subset of these anyons, for instance, can perform truly unforgettable dances. Split an electron into two virtual pieces and swap their places, and you’ll subtly change their identities. When brought back together, the fragments might merge into a single electron—or they might disappear into the vacuum. Shuffling them shifts the probability that they’ll converge to make something or nothing, and the outcome depends on all the prior dances they’ve ever shared with other partners. In this sense, twirling these particles leaves a trail of their past movements, much like braiding hair, in which the order of operations is preserved even if the braid is twisted or tugged. The particles’ history is woven into the system’s topology, or mathematical shape.\n\nThanks to a paper in 1997 by the physicist Alexei Kitaev, then at Russia’s Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, this strange electron choreography became the blueprint for a new kind of computer.\n\nTraditional computers rely on transistors, switches that turn electricity off and on, encoding either a 0 or a 1—a “bit” of information. Connect these switches in the right way, and the machine can run any conceivable calculation, although exceptionally complex tasks could take billions of years.\n\nQuantum computers promise to speed up the process by exploiting the strange rules of quantum physics. If your quantum-bit, or “qubit,” is made from an object like an atom, it can embody many different superpositions of 0 and 1 states. A relatively small array of qubits, linked through a process called entanglement, can encode a vast number of possible computations. For certain questions, scientists can manipulate those qubits using algorithms that boost the probability of them settling on the correct answer.\n\nIn theory, tasks such as simulating chemical interactions and factoring large numbers (the basis for modern cryptography) suddenly become a lot more manageable—making quantum computers both a lucrative gadget and a national security threat.\n\nThe catch is that qubits are fragile. Environmental noise can easily disturb them, leading to erroneous changes in their properties or a premature collapse to a definite 0 or 1 state. Because the qubits are entangled, these errors spread like wildfire, and the entire computation goes kaput.\n\nStandard quantum firefighting calls for redundant qubits to correct the errors, but that’s proving to be an epic challenge. The heartiest proto–quantum computers today boast hundreds of qubits, far short of the millions or billions they will probably need to operate error-free. “It is turning out to be an engineering nightmare,” says Sankar Das Sarma, a theoretical physicist at the University of Maryland.\n\nKitaev proposed a clever workaround to the problem. In his scheme, the qubits would consist not of atoms, but those special anyon pairs, which can capture quantum information in their dissociated electrons. By entangling multiple anyons and nudging them through the braided series of dances, you can perform calculations that settle on the right answer—which is finally read out by revealing whether the anyons merged into an electron (a 1) or nothing (a 0). Because the electron is effectively split and doesn’t exist in any one place, it is impervious to local disturbances.\n\nThe challenge then becomes how to get an electron to scatter its tracks so deceivingly. The simplest way is to link an electron and a hole so perfectly that they form two separate entities that are each half-electron and half-hole. These quantum yin-yang particles, both identical and opposite, much like the particles Majorana posited, would have no energy and no charge. With zero energy, the paired quasiparticles would rest securely in a gap between the positive and negative energy levels where electrons and holes can exist, offering extra protection from the noisy world.\n\nKitaev’s idea of harnessing the quasiparticles’ built-in error protection is now known as topological quantum computing, and some believe it’s the technology’s best hope. Without the Majorana at its core, “I personally do not see any hope ever of building a true fault-tolerant quantum computer,” Das Sarma says. “Some revolutionary advance is needed.”\n\nAround 2004, UCSB mathematician Mike Freedman wrote a letter directly to Microsoft founder Bill Gates promoting the idea of topological quantum computing. A year or so later, the company boldly bought in and established Station Q, initially just a five-person team that met in a seminar room inside the hexagonal oceanfront tower of the prestigious Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, which juts out from the UCSB campus like a lighthouse. With a seemingly limitless budget and free range to explore wild ideas, the group was the envy of the fledgling world of topological computing, says Zhenghan Wang, a UCSB mathematician and founding member of Station Q. “It was the perfect place.”\n\nBefore Ettore Majorana vanished in 1938, he sent a series of cryptic messages to his family and colleagues about his impending “sudden disappearance,” leading many to suspect he’d taken his own life. But over the following years, purported sightings of Majorana multiplied: as a beggar in Naples, a monk in Calabria, and a vagabond in South America. The search for the ghost of his particle has been similarly confounded by impostors. “There are many, many papers … all of them claim it’s Majorana,” Das Sarma says. “None of them is Majorana.”\n\nMicrosoft’s opening strategy was to take advantage of the fractional quantum Hall effect, a peculiar behavior of electrons in 2D systems. Under a high magnetic field, electrons in the material take on specific energy levels, and each level can hold a maximum number of electrons. The electrons re­arrange themselves to avoid one another, creating a sort of quantum fluid with properties that depend on how large a fraction of a given energy level is filled. If you half-fill the second energy level, for instance, a slight change in the magnetic field should induce ripples in the fluid that seem to be quarter-electron charges, each of which is associated with a Majorana quasiparticle.\n\nMicrosoft researchers began to look for these fractional charges in samples of gallium arsenide, a compound often used in solar cells. But after years of trying, scientists couldn’t get the material to cooperate: The Majorana’s protective energy gap was too small, and applying electrical gates to wrangle the quasiparticles into any useful dance was too challenging.\n\nJust as hope started to wane for the quantum Hall approach, a new proposal emerged: wrapping a superthin nanowire in a fancy superconducting jacket, which allows the electrons inside to link up in a long, single-file chain of pairs. If there’s an odd number of electrons in the wire, the unpaired electron should essentially split in half to form two separated Majorana quasiparticles—one at each end of the wire. If you then lay multiple wires across each other in latticelike frameworks, you can get the Majoranas to dance and braid by having them hop between intersections.\n\nA search for tenacious qubits\n\nMajorana quasiparticles, made from pairs of fractional electrons, could in theory embody the quantum bits (qubits) in an error-free quantum computer. The physical separation of the fractional electrons should protect the quantum information they hold from heat and noise, and computations occur by swapping or braiding their positions. Researchers are hunting for the quasiparticles in three systems.\n\nThe Microsoft team readily changed horses and began to fund nanowire research. In 2012, one team, led by Leo Kouwenhoven, a physicist at the Delft University of Technology, varied the voltage across the tip of their wire from negative to positive values and reported seeing a small peak in conductance at zero—evidence, they thought, of Majorana pairs residing at zero energy. But theorists soon realized other less interesting electron quasiparticles could also hover around zero energy and mimic that same signature. It was the first of many Majorana mirages.\n\nSome theorists argued that the real Majorana would have a clear signature: a zero-energy conductance peak at a specific value. In 2018, Kouwenhoven’s group measured that mark, which at the time was considered a “smoking gun,” he says. Microsoft crowned Kouwenhoven the founding director of its new campus in Delft. The company’s vice president predicted they’d have a working topological qubit later that year and urged the Department of Energy to invest in the blossoming “quantum economy.”\n\nBut then the bubble popped. The signal was again shown to be inconclusive. Soon after, Kouwenhoven’s paper fell under scrutiny for alleged data manipulation and in 2021 was retracted by Nature, which cited a combination of confirmation bias and instrumental miscalibration. In the following years, two similar claims from other groups were retracted by Nature and Science, and a fourth paper led by Marcus received an editorial expression of concern in Science.\n\nThe reason researchers kept getting fooled, Kouwenhoven maintains, is that they focused on finding certain signatures without fully understanding the underlying mechanisms. “We jumped over a huge amount of physics,” he says. Other scientists suggest the problem runs deeper, pointing to the pressure to deliver results and publish in high-impact journals. Chris Palmstrøm, a UCSB physicist who manufactures nanowires for many experiments, traces it to Microsoft’s overzealous push to demonstrate a topological qubit. “They were trying to run before they could crawl,” he says. “It was perhaps too early to promise all of this.”\n\nAround the time many of these claims fell apart, Microsoft had a culture change. Chetan Nayak, a Microsoft physicist since the dawn of Station Q, took over from Freedman as engineering lead with a business-oriented vision that would focus on commercialization while guarding against intellectual property leaks. “We’re not in a mode of exploration,” Nayak says. “You need to have everyone focused on this journey, and that’s not going to happen with a bunch of academic labs.” Microsoft eventually cut most of its funding for its university collaborations and moved the bulk of its quantum computing research in-house.\n\nThe shift drove many big names out of the game. “Early in the academic-corporate quantum space … we just had the best of both worlds,” laments Marcus, who left Microsoft in 2021. “Then we grew up and the corporate experience changed.” Kouwenhoven departed the following year. Earlier this year, Freedman also left Microsoft, and he recently joined the competing Google team across the parking lot.\n\nFiona Burnell, a theoretical physicist at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, credits Microsoft’s investments with helping lure her into the field, but says the company’s secrecy complicates replication efforts. “It’s a double-edged sword,” she says. Microsoft’s latest Majorana publication in June, for example, omits recipes for fabricating nanowires, which the company regards as trade secrets. “Of course, I wish that they would maintain more openness with the academic community,” Alicea says. “But maybe it’s impossible.”\n\nIn 2011, the public prosecutor’s office in Rome reopened its investigation into Ettore Majorana’s disappearance. Detectives had come across an alleged photograph of Majorana from 1955 in Venezuela, where he had supposedly been living under the alias “Mr. Bini.” They attempted to match the man’s facial structure to an old photo of Majorana and concluded that he had run away to South America, perhaps because he foresaw how his colleagues’ work on atomic energy could lead to nuclear weapons. Content with the explanation, the prosecutor’s office officially closed the case in 2015. But many were left dissatisfied. Francesco Guerra, a physicist at the Sapienza University of Rome who continues to investigate the case, says the conclusion was “completely ridiculous.”\n\nMajorana researchers, similarly vexed by the low standard of evidence, are now pushing to raise the bar. “A photo is not enough,” Kouwenhoven says. “We need DNA evidence.” The growing agreement is that the only conclusive signature of Majoranas would be to get them to work as qubits. “It’s braiding or bust,” says Andrea Young, a UCSB physicist.\n\nThe present search for Majoranas is proceeding along three primary avenues. The first is the continued effort in nanowires, a torch largely carried by Microsoft. In their June paper, Microsoft researchers reported progress in making their nanowire Majoranas more robust, a feat Nayak likened in a LinkedIn post to “inventing steel.”\n\nThe Majorana’s protection depends on the size of the gap between the quasiparticles’ zero-energy state and the electrons’ closest available energy level. If the gap is too small, tiny temperature variations will inject energy that can either destroy the Majoranas or create unwanted quasiparticles that might mess with the Majorana signal, particularly if the wire’s ends aren’t sufficiently separated.\n\nThe Microsoft researchers measured the energy gap of their nanowires at 30 microelectronvolts, above the 10 µev needed for them to be confident the signal is real. The next steps are to show that a pair of Majoranas can merge to a 0 or 1 state and to braid two Majorana pairs into a functional qubit. Nayak believes his team can do both. “Internally, we’re very convinced,” he says. “We’re kind of off to the races with this.”\n\nThe community, however, is largely withholding applause. Some continue to shame Microsoft for safeguarding fabrication methods and parts of its simulations. Others complain the wire is still not clean or long enough to prevent internal disorder in the wire from triggering spurious signals. But even assuming the signal is from Majoranas, the tiny energy gap Microsoft reported would offer limited protection in real world operations, says Mike Zaletel, a theorist at UC Berkeley who previously worked on the nanowires at Station Q. “It’s hard to see that they would have a very robust qubit with a gap that small.”\n\nAt the nearby UCSB, Young is taking a wholly different route to Majorana quasiparticles, one that revives the fractional quantum Hall effect, but in graphene instead of gallium arsenide. Graphene, an atom-thick layer of carbon arranged in a hexagonal array, was first discovered in 2004 when researchers peeled off a layer from graphite using nothing more than Scotch tape. Young and colleagues have since figured out how to stack slivers of graphene and other materials into perfectly clean sandwiches, providing a quantum Hall playground that’s thinner than gallium arsenide, where electrons can more easily be coaxed to interact and split into quarter-charges. They also learned how to carve graphite crystals into intricate electrical gates, which they can place on top of their devices to trap and control the quasiparticles.\n\nRecently, Young and colleagues measured the energy gap of the state where Majoranas are expected to form in their graphene, and found it to be about 10 times larger than Microsoft’s gap. That should protect a graphene-based qubit at temperatures as high as 5 kelvin—relatively warm for quantum work like this, Young says. “It really finally feels like we have an avenue to attack this legitimately,” he says. “I think we will be able to make a qubit without any miracles.”\n\nAli Yazdani, a physicist at Princeton University working on similar graphene sandwiches, uses electron microscopes to create a map of how the energy gap varies across the graphene surface, offering a useful guide for where robust Majoranas might congregate. In a paper now under review, he and his colleagues identify multiple spots where the energy gap is “whoppingly huge,” he says—even larger than Young’s. The two groups have planned experiments to implant the quarter-electron charges and braid their accompanying Majoranas. “It’s early days for taking this to the next level, but there is no clear showstopper,” Yazdani says.\n\nAlready, the graphene efforts have offered “a breath of fresh air” to the community, Alicea says. “It’s one of the most promising avenues that I’ve seen in a while.” Since leaving Microsoft, Zaletel has shifted his focus to graphene. “It’s clear that this is just where you should do it now,” he says.\n\nBut not everyone believes they will have enough control over the free-moving quasiparticles in the graphene system to scale up to an array of qubits—or that they can create big enough gaps to keep out intruders. Manipulating the quarter-charge quasiparticles in graphene is much more complicated than moving the Majoranas at the ends of nanowires, Kouwenhoven says. “It’s super interesting for physics, but for a quantum computer I don’t see it.”\n\nJust across the parking lot from Station Q’s new office, a third kind of Majorana hunt is underway. In an unassuming black building branded Google AI Quantum, past the company rock-climbing wall and surfboard rack, a dozen or so proto–quantum computers dangle from workstations, hidden inside their chandelier-like cooling systems. Their chips contain arrays of dozens of qubits based on a more conventional technology: tiny loops of superconducting wires through which current oscillates between two electrical states. These qubits, like other standard approaches, are beset with errors, but Google researchers are hoping they can marry the Majorana’s innate error protection to their quantum chip.\n\nError correction on classical computers works by copying one bit’s information to additional bits, but that’s a challenge in quantum computers, because the laws of quantum mechanics forbid quantum states from being “cloned.” Google’s workaround (also conceived by Kitaev) is to get the array of qubits to act like a topological material and to store the information nonlocally, smearing it across many qubits so that it’s not accessible from any single measurement. Recently, Google engineers brought the Majorana connection a step closer to reality with the help of Cornell University theorist Eun-Ah Kim.\n\nIn graduate school, Kim worked on designs for braiding anyons in quantum Hall systems, but she grew frustrated with the endless engineering hurdles. Last year, after Google researchers presented their latest qubit array at Cornell, “I realized that this is the setting where my dream can finally come true,” Kim says. She and colleagues learned to group together patches of qubits within Google’s array and then remove connections between individual qubits to create imperfections in the grid. In a Nature publication in May, the team demonstrated that twirling those imperfections shifts their properties much like braiding Majoranas. The company Quantinuum reported a similar experiment in a preprint around the same time.\n\nUnlike naturally emergent Majoranas, these simulated ones are only stable while errors are manually corrected. But the distinction doesn’t matter as long as they help protect the qubits, says Hartmut Neven, founding director of Google Quantum AI. “The question is: What is easier to do?” he asks. “Trying to do it on the low-level hardware is maybe the harder route.”\n\nThe Google team has yet to use the scheme to actually detect and correct errors. Still, the experiment demonstrates scientists’ growing command over quantum systems, Marcus says. “We’re beginning to master fire.”\n\nOver the years, accounts of Ettore Majorana’s disappearance have degraded into baseless conspiracies and fictional spin-offs featuring alien abductions and time-travel machines. But Guerra and Nadia Robotti, a historian of physics at the University of Genoa, think the truth is out there. They have uncovered new documents from government, religious, and familial archives that seem to reference Majorana’s death about 1 year after his disappearance. For example, one letter written by a Jesuit priest to Majorana’s brother in 1939 honors “the mourned Ettore Majorana” and “the beloved extinct.”\n\nGuerra and Robotti still do not know where or how he died, but they think his descendants have documents that would shed more light. And 3 years ago, the researchers flew to UC Berkeley to visit the archive of Emilio Segrè, whose friendship with Majorana soured in the years before his disappearance. The researchers came across a folder that, per Segrè’s instructions, cannot be opened until the year 2057. Guerra hopes it will contain details that will resolve the case once and for all.\n\nThe search for the Majorana quasiparticle is following a similar dynamic. Many researchers are jaded, including Palmstrøm, who says the field’s spotty history has eroded his optimism. Even Kitaev, the pioneer, who now works at Caltech and consults for Google, has grown cynical. “Theoretically, it’s just beautiful, but in practice it seems that we don’t have a suitable technology to make it work well,” he says.\n\nAnd yet, many in the game can’t seem to give up the hunt. Palmstrøm continues to meticulously prepare semiconductor nanowires for study, baking them in a foil-wrapped vacuum to expel unwanted gas molecules, scrubbing them with a pressure hose of atomic hydrogen to remove every last contaminating atom, and coating them with a thin superconducting jacket.\n\nLike most Majorana researchers, Palmstrøm does not expect a single triumphant moment of discovery. But he’s hooked on the hope that iterations of increasingly precise experiments will gradually bring the long-sought particle into focus.\n\n“We’re driven to find the truth,” Palmstrøm says. “I think we will.”",

        "title": "To combat climate change, companies bury plant waste at sea",
        "authors": "Saima Sidik",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Carbon in woody debris from forestry or agriculture could remain sequestered on the sea floor for centuries.\n\nDror Angel, a marine ecologist at the University of Haifa, had for years heard his archaeologist colleagues talk about ancient shipwrecks on the bottom of the Black Sea that were perfectly preserved by the low-oxygen environment. “You can see ropes,” Angel says. “It’s something which is quite spectacular.”\n\nNow, Angel wants to combat climate change by purposefully adding to the wreckage, sinking waste wood to the sea floor, where carbon that the trees stored up while living can remain locked away for centuries.\n\nAngel is a science lead for an Israeli company called Rewind, one of many companies riding a wave of investment in technologies that could help limit global warming by drawing carbon out of the atmosphere and locking it up. Whereas some carbon capture schemes require expensive machines and complex chemistry, burying terrestrial biomass at sea is exceedingly simple: It requires tugboats, barges, and woody waste from forestry and agriculture.\n\nThe approach has advantages over another popular ocean-based carbon capture strategy: growing, and sinking, massive amounts of seaweed or phytoplankton. Because the plant material is grown on land rather than in the ocean, it is less likely to rob nutrients from the surrounding water and upset the ecology. Industrial agriculture and forestry have an extensive infrastructure for growing, processing, and transporting plants, in contrast to marine farming, which has never been attempted at scale. And because woody plants are tough and unlikely to degrade, they are good at hanging on to their carbon. “Decomposers don’t like to eat them—they don’t get much out of it,” says Ning Zeng, a climate scientist at the University of Maryland.\n\nAt the same time, the approach may fall short of what’s needed to fight climate change. To keep warming below 2°C, the world needs to capture and store about 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by midcentury, according to the International Energy Agency. But terrestrial biomass can be sunk only where supplies of waste are located near suitable bodies of water. By one recent estimate, the approach could sequester a few tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide in total—just a few years of the need.\n\n“The terrestrial biomass thing is not going to solve the full problem,” says ocean engineer Kate Moran from Ocean Networks Canada, a group that is assessing the efficacy of carbon capture strategies. “It’s going to be a small piece of the pie if it is deemed to be more beneficial than risky.” But, she adds, “We need all the tools in the toolbox.”\n\nIn the Black Sea, Rewind has one of the world’s great carbon burial sites. The sea is much saltier at the bottom than at the top, so the two layers don’t mix much at all—one reason why very little oxygen makes it to the sea floor. Without oxygen, microbes are limited in their ability to convert the carbon in biomass back into greenhouse gases, such as methane, and even if some methane is produced, chemical reactions in the sulfate-rich waters will break it down. And because the layers don’t mix, any trace greenhouse gases that are produced will be locked in the depths for hundreds or thousands of years. “There’s all these additional processes that add more layers of security,” Angel says.\n\nThe advantages are enough to lure investors hoping to sell credits for the carbon removed from the atmosphere. Carbon credit marketplace Supercritical recently became Rewind’s first customer, and next summer the company plans to start sinking biomass in burlap sacks—possibly including forestry residue, river driftwood, and agricultural waste. Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, and Georgia have all shown interest in the project, Angel says.\n\nFrontier Climate—a group that makes commitments to buy future credits from carbon sequestration startups—recently awarded $250,000 R&D grants to Rewind and another firm, Houston-based Carboniferous, which hopes to sink sugarcane waste in an oxygen-starved region of the Gulf of Mexico known as Orca Basin. The waste is abundant on Gulf Coast farms, says Morgan Raven, a biogeochemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the company’s chief science officer. “It’s already sitting in piles,” she says. “The alternative for this material is essentially that it degrades, releases methane, and requires tending so it doesn’t light on fire.” Carboniferous is now applying for permission to test its strategy from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nPortland, Maine–based Running Tide is combining terrestrial and marine biomass in one carbon capture strategy. The company takes waste wood from a forestry operation in Nova Scotia that would otherwise be burned or left to decay and presses it together to create floating “buoys” the size of baseballs and basketballs that are seeded with seaweed. The buoys are released off the coast of Iceland, where ocean currents carry them over a deep region with little oxygen. Eventually they become waterlogged and sink, along with any seaweed that has grown en route. Last summer, Running Tide sold its first carbon credits to Shopify, and the company says it has sunk tens of thousands of tons of material into the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMarine scientist David Koweek of the nonprofit Ocean Visions, which has previously supported Running Tide’s research, lauds the simplicity of sinking terrestrial biomass, because technology exists for almost every step in the process. That’s a strong reason why “you might think about doing this,” he says.\n\nBeyond that, the benefits are murkier. Even though boats are a climate-friendly form of transportation (trucks emit at least 100 times more carbon per kilometer), Angel says it wouldn’t make sense to ship biomass around the world to get it to favorable sites. And although sunk terrestrial biomass doesn’t steal nutrients from marine life, removing it from land could deplete soil of nutrients. “Over time we’re going to also be losing some of the fertility that crops and forests need,” says Charlotte Levy, a biogeochemist at Carbon180, which advocates for scaling up carbon removal projects. Levy also worries that as innovators find new uses for scrap biomass—for example, as sustainable building materials or biochar, a charcoal-like soil additive—sinking the biomass might not be the most environmentally friendly use.\n\nZeng agrees that sinking terrestrial biomass will be limited to a few areas of the ocean for the foreseeable future.

        "articleBody": "Maybe in the moment, players don’t have time to think about the ramifications of a win or a loss.\n\nAnd sometimes players like to say they are so focused they don’t think about it at all.\n\nBut as the Seahawks lost four in a row to fall to 6-7, one thing they clung to is that all playoff hope had not been lost.\n\n“People like to say we don’t look at all that,” Seahawks linebacker Jordyn Brooks said. “We look at it, all right? We look at it to see where we’re at, and it gives you clarification. It’s like, ‘All right, things went bad, but you still have a chance.’ It gives you something to keep fighting for.”\n\nThe Seahawks did just that Monday night, using a last-minute rally to beat the Eagles 20-17.\n\nThat victory, coupled with a few fortunate bounces of the ball in games elsewhere last week — most notably, two losses in six days by the Packers in games they were favored and former University of Washington star Jake Browning leading the Bengals to a comeback victory over the Vikings — gave the Seahawks about as much help with their postseason chances as they could have reasonably hoped.\n\nThe result was the Seahawks, who could have had playoff odds in the low teens when last weekend’s games ended, have a better-than-even chance to reach the postseason.\n\nBut every week is a new week.\n\nIt’s one that’s already begun from the Seahawks’ standpoint, with two teams they are competing with for playoff spots, the Rams and Saints, playing Thursday night.\n\nIn somewhat bad news for the Seahawks, the Rams won 30-22. Via the New York Times’ Upshot Playoff Calculator, that decreased their playoff hopes from 53% to 49%. That’s because the Rams, who are 8-7, have the tiebreaker because of a head-to-head sweep. \n\nThat means if the Rams win out, the Seahawks are logically consigned to the seventh spot in the NFC playoffs. Winning out might not be easy for the Rams.\n\nWith seven teams making the playoffs in each conference, the top seed gets a bye and the other six play the first weekend. The four division winners host games as the top four seeds. The three teams with the next-best records make the playoffs as wild cards.\n\nThe Seahawks have already been eliminated from winning the NFC West and are competing for a wild-card spot.\n\nHere is the NFC playoff picture following Thursday’s game:\n\n1. San Francisco (11-3)\n2. Dallas (10-4)\n3. Detroit (10-4)\n4. Tampa Bay (7-7)\n5. Philadelphia (10-4)\n6. Los Angeles Rams (8-7)\n7. Minnesota (7-7)\n8. Seahawks (7-7)\n9. New Orleans (7-8)\n10. Atlanta (6-8)\n11. Green Bay (6-8)\n12. Giants (5-9)\n13. Chicago (5-9)\n\n(Washington, Arizona and Carolina have been eliminated.)\n\nOf note:\n\n— Dallas has tiebreakers on Detroit because of better conference record and the Eagles because of division record.\n\n— Tampa Bay holds the the NFC South lead and would get the fourth seed and a home game whether anyone thinks that’s fair or not. But hey, just remember what kind of memory that gave the Seahawks in 2010.\n\n— And the Vikings have the tiebreaker on the Seahawks because of a better conference record — 6-3 to Seattle’s 6-5 — which was why Minnesota’s loss last week was so big (and why the Seahawks will need to send Browning a thank-you card if they make it). But that, too, can change.\n\nLet’s review the remaining schedules for each of the teams the Seahawks are competing with.\nRams (8-7)\n\nWhat’s next: Dec. 31, at Giants; Jan. 6-7 at 49ers.\n\nComment: LA is one of the NFL’s hottest teams, winning five of six beginning with its comeback victory over the Seahawks on Nov. 19. Which, yep, was a real killer for the Seahawks. LA’s only loss in that time was an overtime defeat at Baltimore. The Rams will be favored to defeat the Giants, but with Tommy DeVito anything is possible. Potentially complicating things is whether the 49ers will have anything to play for in that final game. San Francisco has tiebreaker edges on the Cowboys and Eagles and could have the No. 1 seed wrapped up by then (in fact, they could do it this weekend).\nVikings (7-7)\n\nWhat’s next: Sunday, vs. Detroit; Dec. 31, vs. Green Bay; Jan. 6-7 at Detroit.\n\nComment: The two games left against the Lions means the Vikings are alive for the NFC North title. They have a 46% chance at that. That rises to 74% with a victory Sunday and drops to 29% with a loss. In what’s obviously good news for the Seahawks, the game against Green Bay is assured of handing a loss to the Vikings or Packers.\n\nSeahawks (7-7)\n\nWhat’s next: Sunday, at Tennessee; Dec. 31, vs. Pittsburgh; Jan. 6-7, at Arizona.\n\nComment: That the Seahawks will likely be favored to win their last three games, and that many other contenders are assured of losses due to playing each other, is why their odds fluctuated so greatly based on the win over the Eagles. The Seahawks’ playoff odds increase to 60% with a win Sunday and decrease to 30% with a loss.\nBuccaneers (7-7)\n\nWhat’s next: Sunday, vs. Jacksonville; Dec. 31, vs. New Orleans; Jan. 6-7, at Carolina.\n\nComment: Victories in the next two games would essentially clinch the NFC South for the Bucs and make them irrelevant from the Seahawks’ standpoint. Upshot has their odds at 83% to make the playoffs, 80% to win the division.\nSaints (7-8)\n\nWhat’s next: Dec. 31, at Tampa Bay; Jan. 6-7, vs. Atlanta.\n\nComment: The Seahawks have a solid conference-games edge on the Saints — 6-5 to New Orleans’ 4-6. The Saints (obviously) lose out on tiebreakers to the Rams. That means New Orleans’ most realistic hope is to win out and hope that’s enough to take the NFC South. (Tampa Bay has most tiebreaker edges on the Saints.) The Saints have just a 15% chance to make the playoffs, via Upshot, and 3% as a wild card.\nFalcons (6-8)\n\nWhat’s next: Sunday, vs. Colts; Dec. 31, at Bears; Jan. 6-7, at Saints.\n\nComment: The Falcons are barely clinging to life with 11% playoff odds, and 3% for the wild card, via Upshot. A loss this weekend, regardless of other results, drops their playoff chances to 4%.\nPackers (6-8)\n\nWhat’s next: Sunday, at Carolina; Dec. 31, at Minnesota; Jan. 6-7 vs. Chicago.\n\nComment: Wins over the Lions and Kansas City got Green Bay to 6-6 and 72% to make the playoffs. But in the “you just never know” department, the Packers lost to the Giants and at home to Tampa Bay and now are at just 22%, via Upshot. A loss to Carolina drops those chances to 5%.",

        "articleBody": "Other places would kill for Seattle’s assets. I’ve been writing a variation of this thought for 15 years.\n\nThe reality was apparent in 2018 when some 240 localities were willing to shell out huge subsidies for Amazon’s HQ2, promised to be “full, equal” to Seattle’s headquarters.\n\nAs it turned out, no homicide was necessary. Start with a dysfunctional City Council majority, add a pandemic and its effects, throw in metropolitan areas and states upping their game and … presto! Seattle’s facing new competitors.\n\nThe title of a new report from the Brookings Institution shouts the news from the rooftops: “Tech jobs are finally spreading out, spurred by private investment and federal initiatives.”\n\nThe study from Brookings fellow Mark Muro and research assistant Yang You indicates recent growth in five critical digital sectors “is now dominated by a group of nonsuperstar cities wholly different from the Big Tech meccas that ruled for years.”\n\nThe information comes by tallying job growth in five key digital sectors, including software development, computer systems design and web publishing.\n\nThose superstars include coastal cities such as San Francisco; San Jose, Calif.; Los Angeles; New York City; Boston; and, of course, Seattle. With high concentration of tech sectors through the booming 2010s, they accounted for nearly half of the nation’s technology jobs created between 2015 and 2019.\n\nNow, the geography of technology jobs is changing.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, “rising star” metros such as Dallas; Austin, Texas; Denver; Salt Lake City; and Miami posted the largest increases in digital services jobs. Houston; Nashville, Tenn.; and Jacksonville, Fla., also saw surprising growth in tech jobs.\n\nSeattle barely saw growth: 0.1% during those years. But former tech stars such as San Francisco, San Jose, Boston and New York City faced larger declines, an unimaginable turn after decades of industry concentration.\n\nOne force propelling the shift is $230 billion in private investment in semiconductors, clean energy and other advanced industries, as well as reshoring of conventional manufacturing. Another is federal money: a major portion of the $3.8 billion allocated by Congress this past year was for metro areas in the Intermountain West, Midwest and South.\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act allocates $280 billion to increase U.S. semiconductor capacity and marshal research and development, as well as create regional high-tech hubs.\n\nU.S. chip capacity is a fraction of where it once stood and the legislation is intended to raise it, an important national and economic security aspiration in a period of “Great Power Competition” with China.\n\nThis isn’t the only area where Seattle is facing competition.\n\nAccording to the Milken Institute’s Best Performing Cities report, Provo-Orem, Utah, ranked at the top, followed by Austin and Raleigh, N.C. The top performers are rounded out by Nashville, Dallas and Boise, Idaho.\n\nMilken’s research “reflects cities’ effectiveness at leveraging their resources to promote economic growth and provide their residents with access to the essential services and infrastructure needed for success. Its components include job creation, wage growth and the high-tech sector’s output growth. Since 2021, the index also includes measures of housing affordability and broadband access that reflect access to economic opportunities of cities’ residents.”\n\nSeattle ranked No. 34 in the 2023 assessment compared with No. 13 in 2021. In job growth between 2016 and 2021, Seattle came in at No. 78 out of the 191 major metropolitan areas counted.\n\nTo be sure, Seattle continues to enjoy a strong economy. The most recent World’s Best Cities report, compiled by Resonance Consultancy’s ranking of the planet’s leading urban destinations, ranks Seattle No. 8, behind New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, the other Washington and Miami.\n\nAbout Seattle, Resonance reports that despite the pandemic, the city “has avoided the economic impact that continues to hobble other U.S. urban centers. Population growth remains at just under 1% annually, fueled by talent … and pulled by influential titans of industry in town, from Amazon to Starbucks to Zillow.”\n\nThe Brookings Report, although noting that Seattle showed small tech job growth from 2020 to 2022, also showed that the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area had nearly 188,000 digital service jobs. Those ranged from the workforces at major companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, to startups.\n\nBy comparison, Dallas had 143,000 tech jobs, Denver 83,000, Austin 83,000, Miami 51,000 and Nashville 24,000.\n\nSeattle boasts a natural deep-water port, a world-class university, Boeing and a major aerospace cluster (an advanced industry sector, too), spectacular scenery and lower living costs than Silicon Valley. This continues to make it a destination for world-class talent and the high-end outposts of Bay Area companies.\n\nIn addition, many of the new competitors face challenges of their own. Dallas and Austin, for example, are blue islands in red states with policies, such as outlawing most abortions, that make them less attractive for top talent and investment. Many of the same red-state policies are being enacted in Tennessee and Florida.\n\nPhoenix, the fifth-most-populous city in the nation, has only one real university (the main campus is in suburban Tempe, Ariz.) and lacks many of the urban amenities that make an area inviting to the best tech workers. Arizona has been underfunding education at all levels for decades.\n\nPhoenix doesn’t make the Brookings list. And the advanced industries consist largely of semiconductor plants, which are becoming highly automated, and data centers, which provide few jobs. Both use much water in a metropolitan area where the summers are getting hotter and longer.\n\nStill, the lesson is clear. Seattle can’t be complacent.\n\nNew competitors are out there. And they’re hungry.",

        "articleBody": "When having a conversation about the greatest Olympian of all time, who comes to mind? Michael Phelps? Katie Ledecky? Simone Biles is probably on that list. And if it's not, it should be. \n\nIt wasn't until four years after her first Olympic medal that her now-husband Jonathan Owens even knew her name. The greatest gymnast of all time was just another match when the two connected on a dating app. \n\nIt sparked a little controversy, to say the least, when Owens admitted it in a recent interview. The internet was quick to hop on it with some receipts of his previous Olympic gymnastics comments. \n\nIn case you don't know what's taken the internet by storm, The Sporting News has you covered.\n\nSimone Biles husband interview\n\nThe couple was interviewed about their relationship for the podcast, \"The Pivot.\" Some of Owens' comments brought on some criticism, though.\n\nFor one, he claimed he didn't know who Biles was when they met up.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Lemme see who this is.' I never really paid attention to gymnastics, so it piqued my curiosity,\" he said. \"When she won the Olympics, I was in college and we didn't have NBC, we didn't have Olympics channels, and we were in [training] camp [in] late July, early August.\"\n\nFans found it interesting he hadn't heard of Biles for four years after her 2016 Olympic run. But there was even more criticism for another one of his comments.\n\n\"I always say that the men are the catch,\" Owens said.\n\nThe couple is unfazed by the controversy the internet has sparked, taking to social media to show their support.\n\n\"Unbothered,\" Owens captioned his post.\n\nBiles kept hers a little more casual.\n\n\"The Pivot\" themselves responded to the backlash, posting more videos of the interview with one captioned, \"If you care enough to look at the headlines and comment off that, hopefully you’ll care enough to see the full conversation!!\"\nWhen did Simone Biles meet her husband?\n\nBiles met Owens in 2020 on the dating app Raya.\n\nWhile Owens didn't know who she was, the two matched anyway and began texting. After a few days, they decided to meet up. Owens was new to Houston, where he later played two seasons with the Texans, while Biles trained at a gym just outside the city.\n\nAnd the rest is history. They tied the knot on April 22, 2023, at Harris County Courthouse in Houston. They celebrated with a wedding in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico a few weeks later.\nSimone Biles 2012 Olympics\n\nBiles did not compete in the 2012 Olympics, but she's often compared to Gabby Douglas, who won that year's all-around gold medal. Douglas was the first Black woman to claim the title and helped Team USA to its second team gold, their first since 1996.\n\nOwens certainly kept up with Douglas, for better or worse, during her first of two Olympics.\n\nBiles is the most-decorated gymnast of all time. Between the Olympics and Worlds competitions, she has 37 medals.\n\nShe competed in the 2016 and 2021 Olympics, but withdrew partway through the Tokyo competition due to a dangerous mental block known as the \"twisties\" which causes gymnasts to get lost in the air and risk severe injury.\n\nStill, she has eight Olympic medals, four of them gold.\n\nSimone Biles net worth\n\nLike many professional athletes, most of Biles' income comes from sponsorships.\n\nIn 2021, Forbes estimated she was making $5 million annually off endorsements with brands like Athleta, GK Elite, Kellogg's, Uber Eats and Visa. The next year, she was named one of the highest-paid female athletes of the year with an estimated $10 million in off-field revenue.\n\nOlympic athletes can make money off their success, though. Here's how much Biles earned as a bonus for each medal she won at the Rio and Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBiles' current net worth is estimated to be around $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\nJonathan Owens net worth\n\nOwens' net worth is projected at $5 million.\n\nThe safety currently is on a one-year, $1.01 million contract with the Packers, per Sportrac. In 2021, he signed a two-year deal with the Texans worth $1.175 million, which included a signing bonus.",

        "authors": "Bill Bender",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Will Florida State trigger another round of college conference realignment?\n\nThe school scheduled an emergency meeting for its Board of Trustees on Friday. That is the first step toward a possible exit strategy for the Seminoles from the ACC. \n\nWill that actually happen? There are several hurdles – including the Grant of Rights agreement that runs through 2036 – that make such an exit complicated. Still, Florida State trustees were openly talking about leaving the conference before the undefeated Seminoles were excluded from the College Football Playoff this year. \n\nHere is a look at why Florida State wants out, potential hold-ups and options for the school in the future\nWhy Florida State wants to leave ACC\n\nFlorida State's initial complaints involved the ACC's revenue distribution model. The SEC and Big Ten have new television deals, and ESPN reported there is \"expected to be a $30 to $40 million gap\" per school between the ACC and those conferences. \n\nThat prompted a startling comment in early August from Florida State trustee Drew Weatherford, a former quarterback at the school. \"It's not a matter of 'if we leave,' in my opinion,\" he said. \"It's a matter of when and how we leave.\" \n\nFlorida State finished 13-0 this season and won the ACC championship, but became the first unbeaten Power 5 team to be left out of the College Football Playoff. That controversial decision also is a factor in the Seminoles discussing a potential exit strategy. While the 12-team CFP will open up playoff spots for the four major conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12), the at-large bids likely would favor Big Ten and SEC schools. \n\nAccording to The Athletic: \"The school would likely need board approval before filing a complaint against its own conference, with trustees taking part in that major decision as key constituents.\" \n\nIs that battle looming? \nCan Florida State challenge the ACC Grant of Rights? \n\nACC schools signed a Grant of Rights deal – one that stipulates ESPN would fund the ACC Network – that keeps them in agreement through the life of a contract that runs through 2036. Even if Florida State strikes a deal with another conference, all media money belongs to the ACC until the contract expires. This would require a legal battle to challenge. \n\nLast May, there were reports Clemson, Florida State, Miami, North Carolina, NC State, Virginia and Virginia Tech were among the ACC schools exploring how unbreakable that Grant of Rights deal is. The ACC also added three new members in Cal, Stanford and SMU for the 2024 season, so it's possible the conference knows a few schools might be ready to challenge that deal. \n\n\"When I say we have a handle on the grant of rights … We have gotten a lot of counsel on that document,\" Florida State board chairman Peter Collins said last summer. \"That will not be the document that keeps us from taking action.\"\n\nFlorida State conference realignment landing spots\n\nIf Florida State tries to leave the ACC, then what would the next course of action be? A look at the three most logical options – though it's worth noting the SEC and Big Ten have not expressed interest in further expansion at this time. \nSEC\n\nThis would add more brand power to the SEC – if that is what Greg Sankey wants. Florida State is 82-43 in the CFP era, which ranks fifth behind SEC schools Alabama (127-13), Georgia (113-22), Oklahoma (102-28) and LSU (89-38). The Sooners are joining the conference along Texas with 2024, and Sankey could entertain adding the Seminoles and another ACC school (Clemson, North Carolina) to push the league membership to 18, which would match the Big Ten. \n\nBig Ten \n\nThe Big Ten could tap into the Florida market here, and at that point why not go get Miami, too? Florida State is not an AAU accredited university, but a move to the Big Ten could make that happen for the Seminoles. The Big Ten would continue an aggressive geographical expansion that includes a West Coast wing, and they can dip into the South and perhaps grab North Carolina and Virginia along the way. Florida State would add another huge football brand to the conference. \nIndependent \n\nIt's always an option. The Seminoles were independent until 1992, when they joined the ACC. Bobby Bowden, who took over as head coach in 1976, built the program and enjoyed a run from 1987-91 where they went 53-8. Florida State, however, did not win its first national championship until 1993. This would be the least viable option of the three, but it's still a possibility. \n\nShould Florida State consider leaving ACC? \n\nYou thought realignment talk was over? The disparity between the Big Ten and SEC will continue in the 12-team College Football Playoff era, and that is going to lead to more discussions for schools such as Florida State and Clemson. \n\nThe Seminoles are among the 16 power conference schools (including Notre Dame) with a winning percentage of .650 or higher in the CFP era: \n\nYet, what does that mean moving forward? A total of 11 of the schools on that list are from the Big Ten or SEC. Notre Dame and Big 12 schools Oklahoma State and Utah are the others. If the Seminoles can go unbeaten and not make the CFP, then what kind of treatment would they get as a one- or two-loss team in the ACC in the future? That question no doubt lingers, along with the financial disparity concerns. That is why Friday's meeting – and its urgency – is so interesting. \n\nRealignment might not be dead yet, after all. It never is.",

        "authors": "Salvatore Macri",
        "date": "2023-11-10",
        "articleBody": "La validazione delle transazioni è un aspetto fondamentale della tecnologia blockchain. Per garantire l’integrità e la sicurezza delle transazioni effettuate sulla blockchain, è necessario utilizzare specifici meccanismi di validazione. In questo articolo, esploreremo l’importanza della validazione delle transazioni e i diversi approcci utilizzati nella blockchain.\nImportanza della Validazione delle Transazioni\n\nNel contesto della blockchain, la validazione delle transazioni riveste un ruolo cruciale. La validazione assicura che le transazioni siano autentiche e che i dati registrati sulla blockchain siano accurati e immutabili. Senza una corretta validazione, la blockchain rischierebbe di perdere la sua affidabilità e sicurezza, compromettendo l’intero sistema.\n\nLa validazione delle transazioni garantisce inoltre la prevenzione di frodi e attacchi malevoli, proteggendo gli utenti e il sistema stesso dalla manipolazione dei dati. È grazie a questi meccanismi di validazione che la blockchain si è affermata come una tecnologia sicura e affidabile per la gestione di transazioni digitali.\nDiversi Approcci di Validazione in Blockchain\n\nEsistono diversi approcci di validazione utilizzati nella blockchain, ognuno con le proprie caratteristiche e vantaggi. I due approcci più noti sono il Proof of Work (PoW) e il Proof of Stake (PoS). Oltre a questi, ci sono anche altri approcci emergenti come il Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) e il Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).\n\nNel prossimo capitolo, analizzeremo nel dettaglio come funzionano il Proof of Work e il Proof of Stake, evidenziando i loro vantaggi e svantaggi. Successivamente, esploreremo anche gli altri approcci di validazione emergenti. Continua a leggere per scoprire di più sulla validazione delle transazioni in blockchain!\nProof of Work (PoW)\n\nIl Proof of Work (PoW) è uno degli approcci più noti per la validazione delle transazioni in blockchain. Questo algoritmo è stato introdotto con successo da Bitcoin, la prima criptovaluta decentralizzata. Vediamo come funziona il Proof of Work e ne esaminiamo i vantaggi e gli svantaggi.\nCome Funziona il Proof of Work\n\nNel Proof of Work, i partecipanti chiamati “minatori” competono per risolvere complessi problemi matematici. Per validare una transazione, i minatori devono trovare una soluzione al problema, che richiede un’enorme quantità di potenza di calcolo. Una volta trovata la soluzione, il blocco viene aggiunto alla catena di blocchi e il minatore viene ricompensato con una certa quantità di criptovaluta.\n\nL’obiettivo del Proof of Work è rendere difficile la manipolazione della blockchain. Poiché la soluzione richiede un’enorme quantità di potenza di calcolo, sarebbe estremamente costoso e praticamente impossibile per un attaccante alterare la blockchain. Ciò garantisce l’integrità e la sicurezza del sistema.\nVantaggi e Svantaggi del Proof of Work\n\nIl Proof of Work offre diversi vantaggi. Innanzitutto, è un sistema sicuro e resistente agli attacchi. La complessità dei problemi matematici da risolvere richiede una notevole quantità di risorse, rendendo difficile per un attaccante compromettere la blockchain. Inoltre, il Proof of Work ha dimostrato la sua efficacia nel garantire la sicurezza e la decentralizzazione di Bitcoin e di molte altre criptovalute.\n\nTuttavia, il Proof of Work presenta anche alcuni svantaggi. Il processo di mining richiede una notevole quantità di energia elettrica, che può avere un impatto ambientale significativo. Inoltre, il tempo necessario per risolvere i problemi matematici può comportare un ritardo nella conferma delle transazioni, rendendo il sistema meno efficiente in termini di scalabilità.\n\nNonostante gli svantaggi, il Proof of Work rimane uno degli approcci più affidabili per la validazione delle transazioni in blockchain. Tuttavia, negli ultimi anni, sono emersi altri approcci, come il Proof of Stake (PoS) e altri algoritmi di consenso, che cercano di affrontare le limitazioni del Proof of Work. Esploreremo il Proof of Stake nel prossimo capitolo.\n\nPer saperne di più sulla tecnologia blockchain e sulle sue applicazioni, leggi il nostro articolo sulla blockchain demistificata.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS)\n\nCome Funziona il Proof of Stake\n\nIl Proof of Stake (PoS) è un approccio alternativo alla validazione delle transazioni nella blockchain. A differenza del Proof of Work (PoW), in cui i partecipanti devono risolvere complessi problemi matematici per validare le transazioni e ottenere ricompense, nel PoS la selezione del validatore avviene in base alla quantità di criptovaluta posseduta e bloccata come “stake” nel sistema.\n\nNel PoS, i partecipanti che intendono validare le transazioni, noti come “validatori”, devono dimostrare la loro partecipazione alla rete bloccando una quantità specifica di criptovaluta. Questa criptovaluta viene utilizzata come garanzia che il validatore agirà nell’interesse del network, poiché perderà la sua quota di criptovaluta in caso di comportamento dannoso o fraudolento.\n\nLa selezione del validatore avviene in modo casuale, ma la probabilità di essere scelti è proporzionale alla quantità di criptovaluta posseduta e bloccata come stake. Questo meccanismo incentiva i partecipanti a mantenere una condotta onesta e sicura per proteggere il proprio investimento.\n\nVantaggi e Svantaggi del Proof of Stake\n\nIl Proof of Stake offre diversi vantaggi rispetto al Proof of Work e può essere considerato una soluzione più efficiente ed ecologicamente sostenibile. Ecco alcuni dei vantaggi del PoS:\n\n1. Consumo energetico ridotto: Poiché il PoS non richiede un’enorme quantità di potenza di calcolo come il PoW, il consumo energetico complessivo è significativamente inferiore. Ciò rende il PoS una scelta più sostenibile dal punto di vista ambientale.\n\n2. Maggiora scalabilità: Il PoS può gestire un numero maggiore di transazioni rispetto al PoW. Poiché la selezione del validatore avviene in base alla quantità di criptovaluta posseduta, non è necessario risolvere complessi problemi matematici. Di conseguenza, la velocità delle transazioni può essere aumentata.\n\n3. Migliore sicurezza: Nel PoS, i partecipanti hanno un interesse finanziario diretto nel mantenere la sicurezza della rete. Poiché perderebbero la loro criptovaluta in caso di comportamento dannoso, ciò fornisce un incentivo per agire nell’interesse del network.\n\nTuttavia, il PoS presenta anche alcuni svantaggi:\n\n1. Concentrazione delle risorse: Poiché la selezione del validatore avviene in base alla quantità di criptovaluta posseduta, ciò può portare a una maggiore concentrazione di risorse nelle mani di pochi partecipanti con grandi quantità di criptovaluta. Ciò potrebbe potenzialmente compromettere la decentralizzazione della rete.\n\n2. Possibilità di attacchi del 51%: Se un singolo partecipante possiede più del 50% della criptovaluta in circolazione, potrebbe teoricamente eseguire un attacco del 51% e compromettere la sicurezza del network. Tuttavia, implementazioni corrette del PoS prevedono meccanismi di sicurezza per prevenire tali attacchi.\n\nIn conclusione, il Proof of Stake offre numerosi vantaggi rispetto al Proof of Work, tra cui un consumo energetico ridotto e una maggiore scalabilità. Tuttavia, è importante considerare attentamente i suoi svantaggi, come la possibile concentrazione delle risorse e la necessità di meccanismi di sicurezza robusti. La scelta tra il PoS e il PoW dipende dalle esigenze specifiche del progetto blockchain e dalle considerazioni relative alla sicurezza, alla decentralizzazione e alla sostenibilità.\n\nAltri Approcci di Validazione\n\nOltre al Proof of Work (PoW) e al Proof of Stake (PoS), esistono altri approcci di validazione utilizzati nelle reti blockchain. Questi approcci offrono alternative interessanti e cercano di affrontare diverse sfide e limitazioni associate alla validazione delle transazioni. Tra questi approcci troviamo il Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), il Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) e altri approcci emergenti.\nDelegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)\n\nIl Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) è un approccio di validazione che si basa sulla selezione di un gruppo ristretto di nodi o “delegati” responsabili della produzione dei blocchi e della validazione delle transazioni. Questi delegati vengono eletti dalla comunità di utenti attraverso un sistema di voto ponderato.\n\nUno dei principali vantaggi del DPoS è la sua capacità di garantire una maggiore scalabilità rispetto ad altri approcci. Poiché solo un numero limitato di nodi è coinvolto nella validazione, i tempi di conferma delle transazioni possono essere ridotti significativamente. Inoltre, il DPoS promuove una maggiore efficienza energetica rispetto al PoW, poiché richiede meno risorse computazionali per la validazione.\n\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)\n\nIl Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) è un approccio di validazione progettato per garantire la sicurezza e la correttezza delle transazioni in una rete blockchain. Si basa su un sistema di consenso in cui i nodi partecipanti raggiungono un accordo sulla sequenza delle transazioni.\n\nIl PBFT richiede una comunicazione intensiva tra i nodi e un alto grado di affidabilità. Tuttavia, offre vantaggi significativi in termini di velocità di conferma delle transazioni e tolleranza ai guasti. Questo approccio è particolarmente adatto per le reti private e per le applicazioni che richiedono una conferma rapida delle transazioni.\n\nAltri Approcci Emergenti\n\nOltre al DPoS e al PBFT, ci sono altri approcci emergenti che stanno guadagnando attenzione nella comunità blockchain. Questi approcci cercano di affrontare specifiche sfide o limitazioni dei sistemi di validazione esistenti.\n\nÈ importante notare che l’evoluzione del campo delle blockchain è continua e che nuovi approcci e algoritmi sono in continua sviluppo. Ciò significa che il panorama della validazione in blockchain è in costante evoluzione, con nuove soluzioni che vengono proposte e testate per affrontare le esigenze specifiche delle diverse reti.\n\nLa scelta dell’approccio di validazione dipende da vari fattori, come la sicurezza, la scalabilità, la decentralizzazione e l’impatto ambientale. Per approfondire questi aspetti, visita i nostri articoli su la blockchain demistificata, Bitcoin e il trilemma delle blockchain.\n\nNel complesso, la scelta dell’approccio di validazione dipende dalle esigenze specifiche della rete blockchain e dalle priorità degli sviluppatori e degli utenti che la utilizzano.\n\nConsiderazioni per la Scelta dell’Approccio di Validazione\n\nQuando si tratta di scegliere l’approccio di validazione più adatto in una blockchain, ci sono diverse considerazioni da tenere in mente. Le principali considerazioni includono sicurezza e decentralizzazione, scalabilità e sostenibilità e impatto ambientale.\n\nSicurezza e Decentralizzazione\n\nLa sicurezza e la decentralizzazione sono due aspetti fondamentali nella scelta dell’approccio di validazione. Un sistema di validazione sicuro assicura che le transazioni siano verificate correttamente e che non vi sia alcuna possibilità di manipolazione o frode. Allo stesso tempo, la decentralizzazione garantisce che il potere decisionale sia distribuito tra i partecipanti della rete, evitando il rischio di un controllo centralizzato.\n\nL’approccio del Proof of Work (PoW), ad esempio, è noto per la sua elevata sicurezza grazie all’utilizzo di potenza di calcolo computazionale. Tuttavia, richiede anche un’enorme quantità di energia elettrica, il che può sollevare preoccupazioni per l’impatto ambientale. D’altro canto, l’approccio del Proof of Stake (PoS) si concentra sulla proprietà di criptovalute come meccanismo di selezione dei validatori, riducendo così il consumo energetico ma richiedendo un certo grado di fiducia nel sistema.\n\nScalabilità e Sostenibilità\n\nLa scalabilità e la sostenibilità sono altre considerazioni importanti nella scelta dell’approccio di validazione. La scalabilità si riferisce alla capacità del sistema di gestire un numero crescente di transazioni senza compromettere le prestazioni. La sostenibilità, d’altra parte, riguarda l’efficienza energetica e l’impatto ambientale del processo di validazione.\n\nMentre il PoW ha dimostrato di essere un approccio sicuro, può essere limitato in termini di scalabilità a causa del tempo e delle risorse necessarie per il completamento di complessi calcoli crittografici. Nel caso del PoS, invece, l’efficienza energetica rende questo approccio più sostenibile, consentendo una maggiore scalabilità.\n\nImpatto Ambientale\n\nL’impatto ambientale è un aspetto sempre più rilevante nella scelta dell’approccio di validazione. Data l’enorme quantità di energia richiesta per il mining nel PoW, si è sollevata l’attenzione sugli effetti negativi sull’ambiente, come l’aumento delle emissioni di carbonio. Ciò ha spinto la comunità blockchain a esplorare alternative più sostenibili come il PoS e altri approcci emergenti.\n\nÈ importante valutare attentamente l’impatto ambientale di un’architettura di validazione prima di adottarla, cercando un equilibrio tra sicurezza, scalabilità e sostenibilità.\n\nLa scelta dell’approccio di validazione in una blockchain dipende dalle esigenze specifiche del progetto e dalle considerazioni menzionate sopra. Per ulteriori informazioni sulla blockchain e le sue implicazioni, consulta il nostro articolo su la blockchain demistificata: comprendere la tecnologia che sta rivoluzionando il settore finanziario.\n\nConclusioni\n\nLa validazione delle transazioni in blockchain è un elemento fondamentale per garantire la sicurezza e l’integrità del sistema. Nel corso di questo articolo, abbiamo esplorato i diversi approcci di validazione, tra cui il Proof of Work (PoW), il Proof of Stake (PoS), il Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) e il Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).\n\nIl Proof of Work è stato il primo algoritmo di validazione utilizzato nella blockchain di Bitcoin. Sebbene sia stato efficace nel garantire la sicurezza e la decentralizzazione della rete, presenta svantaggi come l’alto consumo energetico e la necessità di hardware specializzato.\n\nIl Proof of Stake, d’altra parte, è emerso come un’alternativa più sostenibile dal punto di vista energetico. Invece di basarsi sulla potenza di calcolo, il PoS assegna il diritto di validare le transazioni in base alla quantità di criptovaluta posseduta e bloccata nella rete. Questo approccio riduce significativamente il consumo energetico, ma può sollevare preoccupazioni sulla decentralizzazione.\n\nAltri approcci emergenti, come il DPoS e il PBFT, cercano di bilanciare la sicurezza e la scalabilità, consentendo a un numero ristretto di validatori di prendere decisioni per l’intera rete.\n\nNella scelta dell’approccio di validazione più adatto, è necessario considerare diversi fattori, tra cui la sicurezza, la decentralizzazione, la scalabilità e l’impatto ambientale. Ogni approccio ha i propri vantaggi e svantaggi, e la scelta dipenderà dalle esigenze specifiche del progetto e delle sue comunità di utenti.\n\nÈ importante sottolineare che la blockchain è una tecnologia in continua evoluzione e nuovi approcci di validazione potrebbero emergere in futuro. L’importante è valutare attentamente le opzioni disponibili e considerare sia gli aspetti tecnici che gli impatti sociali ed ambientali.\n\nSe sei interessato a saperne di più sulla blockchain e sulle sue applicazioni, ti consigliamo di leggere i nostri articoli su la blockchain demistificata: comprendere la tecnologia che sta rivoluzionando il settore finanziario e bitcoin: la moneta digitale che ha dato il via alla rivoluzione cripto. Inoltre, se sei interessato a esplorare il futuro della blockchain, ti consigliamo di leggere il nostro articolo su il trilemma delle blockchain: sicurezza, scalabilità e decentralizzazione e metaverso: costruire mondi digitali su fondamenta di blockchain.\n\nLa blockchain è una tecnologia promettente che potrebbe cambiare il modo in cui interagiamo e gestiamo le transazioni digitali.

        "articleBody": "Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nI know I usually lead Startups Weekly with my own column (and I did write one this week, so if you are somehow a fan of everything I write, go ham), but Devin’s piece taking a stand against the pseudanthropy of AI is a must-read. He proposes a new set of rules for AIs to follow to preserve our humanity:\n\n    AI must rhyme??.\n    AI may not present a face or identity??.\n    AI cannot “feel” or “think.”??\n    AI-derived figures, decisions and answers must be marked ‘?’ ??.\n    AI must not make life or death decisions??.\n    AI imagery must have a corner clipped??.\n\nYes, these suggestions can’t realistically be implemented, but read the article anyway; it goes deep about some of the interesting challenges we are facing as AIs get more mature and ubiquitous.\n\nOkay, with today’s philosophy lesson out of the way, let’s dive in and see what else is up in the Right Honorable Royal Kingdom of Startups.\nFlying high, dippin’ deep\n\nThe turbulent journey of startups is continuing.\n\nBird, the once high-flying electric scooter company, has crash-landed into bankruptcy. After a wild ride from a $2 billion valuation to a financial face-plant, this former micromobility poster child is now restructuring its finances faster than one of its scooters racing downhill with a tailwind. Now they’re banking on Chapter 11 to keep their wheels spinning, but only after laying off some feathers and hoping someone finds enough value in their assets to buy them out. The irony? Their Canadian and European operations are still scooting along as if nothing happened.\n\nI’m not gonna say “I told you so,” but there was definitely no coincidence that I picked Bird as the example for the ‘Undertanding the levers in your business’ post I wrote back in 2018 . . .\n\nAnyway. Here’s a few more stories that’ve kept y’all clickin’:\n\nBack to startups: Eric Wu, the co-founder of Opendoor, is ditching his executive chair for a bean bag in the startup world again. After a decade of playing real estate Tetris, Wu’s ready to go back to building things from scratch, amid the toughest real estate market in more than 40 years.\n\nFeeling safer yet?: In a move that’s less surprising than finding out your password is still “password123,” Okta has snapped up security firm Spera for a cool $100 million-ish. The latter is like a cybersecurity Sherlock Holmes, sniffing out digital weaknesses before they become full-blown disasters.\n\nI bet this newsletter triggers their algorithms: Meltwater, the media monitoring maestro that’s been dancing around print and digital news like a tech-savvy ballerina, just got a $65 million pat on the back from Verdane, valuing the company at a cool $592 million.\n\nWhen artificial intelligence is more prevalent than real intelligence.\n\nDevin breaks open the crystal ball for AI in 2024 and predicts a roller-coaster ride from hype to a reality check. He suggests that OpenAI, post-leadership shuffle, might morph into an Apple-esque “ship it” product powerhouse with its own AI app store. Meanwhile, niche AI applications, like agent-based models and generative multimedia, could graduate from “meh” to “hmm, interesting,” especially in monotonous tasks like insurance claims. In the political arena, AI might become a tool for misinformation and manipulation in the 2024 elections, with bot accounts and fake news ramping up the chaos.\n\nI can’t say that I disagree. When media literacy hits rock bottom and AI is on the upswing, we have a perfect storm.\n\nCool cool cool. What else has been cookin’ in the AI kitchen?\n\nComposers, composers, composers: Microsoft Copilot, the AI-powered chatbot, is now dipping its digital toes into the world of music composition through an integration with the GenAI music app Suno. Users can prompt Copilot to create complete songs, including lyrics and instrumentals, with requests like “Create a pop song about adventures with your family.”\n\nHey, Spotify, make me a playlist where every song starts with the letters W, T, and F: Spotify is testing an “AI playlists” feature that lets users create playlists using AI prompts. Users can type prompts into an AI chatbot-style box or choose from suggested prompts like “Get focused at work with instrumental electronica,” or “Songs most likely to drive my parents up the wall.”\n\nSorry, Charles Ponzi, you can’t shop here: Rite Aid has been banned from using facial recognition software for five years, after it was found that its “reckless use of facial surveillance systems” resulted in customer humiliation and jeopardized sensitive information.\n\nThere’s an app for that.\n\nApple has been ordered to cough up $25 million to settle a lawsuit over its Family Sharing feature. The Cupertino-based software giant was promoting a “share-all-the-things” feature for apps that were . . . not sharable. Despite Apple’s “Who, us?” stance, they decided to throw money at the problem rather than endure the endless courtroom drama. Now, some lucky Family Sharing users from the good ol’ days (2015–2019) might get a whopping $30 payout. That’s three months of a post-price-hike Apple TV+ subscription. Yay.\n\nApple got off lightly compared to Google’s recent day in court. In a “My bad, here’s some cash” move, Google’s digging into its sofa cushions for a spare $700 million to settle a lawsuit over its Play Store monopoly antics. Of this, $630 million goes to U.S. consumers and a neat $70 million to U.S. states. The search giant, once known for its “Do No Evil” motto, apparently didn’t extend that to app distribution on Android. As part of the deal, Google’s also revamping its user choice billing program in the U.S., allowing developers more freedom in billing methods. They’re even making sideloading (i.e., installing apps without Google’s blessing) less of a digital obstacle course. But let’s not get too excited — as Epic Games’ VP of public policy points out, consumers are still likely to overpay for digital goods thanks to Google’s hefty fees. So, while Google’s wallet gets lighter, our wallets might not feel much different.",

        "authors": "Dominic-Madori Davis",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have written to the United States’ Acting Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, expressing concerns over the disproportionate impact tech layoffs could have on Black workers, according to a letter seen by TechCrunch.\n\nFirst reported by The Grio, the letter contains a list of questions regarding the steps the Department of Labor has taken to monitor the impact of tech layoffs on African Americans, its regulations around business practices and what the Department of Labor has done to ensure recent Supreme Court cases are not being used to undermine corporate DEI practices and budgets.\n\nMore than 240,000 jobs have been eliminated this year due to layoffs in the tech industry. The worry here is that the “last in, first out” approach to tech layoffs commonly employed at companies may impact new, less senior and “non-essential” employees, who are most likely to be minorities.\n\n“Laying off the most recent hires directly impacts groups of people who benefited from new diversity policies implemented in response to heightened race-based conversations in 2020,” the letter said.\n\n“We’ve seen that Black, Brown, and women tech workers have borne the brunt of layoffs while companies have enjoyed billion-dollar profits,” Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, co-chair of the CBC, told TechCrunch. “Congresswoman [Barbara] Lee and I, as co-chairs of CBC TECH2025, are asking the administration to take action to address this harmful and problematic trend.”\n\nThe Department of Labor has not yet responded to the letter, which is dated December 15. A rep for the Department of Labor told us, “We can confirm that we have received the letter and are reviewing it.”\n\nThe tech and venture industry have faced a downturn these past few years. Following George Floyd’s murder in 2020, many companies made promises to support the Black community. But as the market dipped, diversity pledges have been unfunded, DEI jobs have been cut and venture capital funding to Black founders continues to dip quarter by quarter.\n\nThe CBC is stepping up. Last week, it wrote to Sam Altman and the OpenAI board, asking the company to “move expeditiously in diversifying its board to be inclusive of subject matter expertise with perspective from the African American community.” The OpenAI Board currently does not have any women or people of color.",

        "articleBody": "Tesla owner Elon Musk is often in the news, due to things he might have done or not have done. Recently he was in the news owing to his ex-girlfriend, who put up unseen photos of the billionaire for auction. If Musk’s newsworthiness could be wagered on, using a bet365 account, punters would be having a field day making money off him.\n\nPeople would remember that Elon Musk made an offer for Twitter, back in April 2022. Twitter accepted a whopping $44 billion to give a green signal to Musk’s acquisition deal. Obviously, the deal wasn’t without its own ups and downs. Twitter initially refused Musk’s proposal, because they wanted a shareholder with more stability.\n\nMusk had been able to buy shares, and acquire a 9% stake in the company. He put forth his proposal to buy the test of the shares too, but the management team passed a bill to ensure that could not be brought to fruition. But ultimately, Twitter had to acquiesce, and accept Musk’s deal because no one else would offer them a deal like this.\n\nTwitter had been suffering losses, and had recorded a $221 million loss in the financial year ended 2021. After the deal received a green signal from Twitter, Tesla suffered huge losses in the stocks market owing to risks associated with the deal. After going through so much to confirm the deal, you would expect them to finish it properly, right?\n\nUnfortunately, you would be wrong. Just months after the fiasco, in July, Elon Musk announced to the world that he would be pulling out from the deal. The reason? Twitter had failed to provide him the correct data for fake and spam accounts on the social media app.\n\nTwitter had informed Musk that less than 5% of Twitter users consisted of spam accounts, but on being asked to provide evidence to support the claims, Twitter had refused. Naturally, a legal battle ensued, with Twitter emphasising that they want Musk to keep his end of the deal, because the terms had been met from their side.\n\nNow, in a further twist to this legal saga, Peiter Zatko has acted as a whistleblower against Twitter. Zatko was not only an head of security at Twitter, but is also a prominent network security expert, who had previously raised issues about the security of the internet, almost two decades ago. Zatko complained about the slipshod security practices adopted by Twitter, which meant they weren’t able to accurately estimate the number of spam accounts, or deal with internal threats. \n\nOf course, Twitter has slammed the claims, dismissing him as a resentful employee for having been fired for incompetency. But Zatko’s past records make him a very reliable person, and Musk’s legal team jumped at the opportunity. He has been subpoenaed to be a witness for Musk’s side.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this legal battle further unfolds. With so much happening in the mere span of a few months, more hurdles might be along the way.",

        "authors": "Chris Price",
        "date": "2023-12-06",
        "articleBody": "Every year experts at NordVPN predict the cybersecurity risks awaiting us in the next year. This year they decided to take a different route, looking at the biggest dark web forum to find out the trending topics among the world’s hackers. \n\n“Every year we try to predict sophisticated attacks from experienced hackers, who mostly target businesses or influential people,” says Marijus Briedis, a cybersecurity expert at NordVPN. “This year’s approach helped us realise that regular internet users are often attacked by amateur hackers who are still developing their craft. They can also cause a lot of harm to their victims so users need to be informed about their plans.”\n\nHere are the top five NordVPN cybersecurity predictions for 2024:\n\nDeepfakes drawn into the mainstream\n\nThe most commented threads on the forum included those about leaked images from OnlyFans, Instagram, and other content-sharing platforms. These threads received about 1,850 comments and were among the most discussed on the forum.\n\n“Next year we will see even more attacks where pictures of naked people will be leaked,” says Briedis. “Another route criminals will take is to use AI or deepfake technology to create fake nudes from ordinary pictures in order to trick their buyers – so any image-sharing site will be a target.” \n\nTo avoid having pictures leaked online, Briedis recommends not sending images through social media and using encrypted cloud solutions when sharing photos.\n\nAI will be a hacker’s best friend\n\nHacked ChatGPT accounts and tutorials on using AI for attacks are very popular among hackers. This not only means that AI users are on their radar, but hackers are learning how to use advanced technology to increase the capacity of their work and make their job easier, quicker, and more effective. \n\n“Using AI tools will help automate a significant portion of phishing attacks, making it highly likely these attacks will continue to increase, posing significant cybersecurity threats,” says Briedis. \n\nHe also mentioned that users who are unsure they can spot phishing emails should use browser extensions like Sonar, specifically designed to sniff out scam emails created by machines. \n\nThe cybercrime side hustle\n\nOne in ten posts on the forum were about learning how to execute some form of cyberattack. Among the most commented threads were: “How to dox” (reveal and circulate information about someone online); “List of useful resources for pentesters (people who carry out simulated cyber attacks, usually on businesses) and hackers”; “How to hack WhatsApp of your friend by sending a single link”; “How to instantly crack TikTok accounts easily” and “WiFi hacking course”. \n\n“This demonstrates that professional hackers are sharing their knowledge beyond their peers – for a price,” says Briedis. “As a result we can expect the number of amateur hackers to rise along with a growth in attacks. Users will find themselves in the line of fire more often in 2024 so keeping their devices updated and protected will be a priority, as well as keeping themselves informed about the latest types of attack.” \n\nCustomer data is the biggest show in town\n\nResearchers found that more than half (55%) of Dark Web discussion threads were around leaked customer data, such as social media credentials, drivers’ licences, addresses, emails, and other bits of personal information. \n\n“Hackers may be constantly upgrading their methods but when it comes to prizes, personal data is still their bread and butter,” says Briedis. “Everyone is at risk but taking some straightforward safety precautions like the use of MFA (multi-factor authentication) wherever possible, will make you a far less viable target.” \n\nBiometrics bypassed\n\nMany platforms now offer biometric authentication as an enhanced safety feature for their users. However, the Dark Web research showed that hackers have already learned how to evade some common biometric authentication methods, such as the “selfie verification” that some crypto platforms use. The thread explaining how to bypass this feature had more than 200 comments. \n\n“Biometrics will surely be a part of authentication in the future, but only if it is part of a  multi-factor approach,” says Briedis. “On its own, biometric authentication will be easily bypassed in 2024, which will lead to the appearance of more layered forms of security  to protect online accounts.”\n\nOne of the latest developments in the sphere has been passkey technology. A passkey is a pair of related keys: public and private. Public and private keys do not work without one another and therefore are useless to hackers. Moreover, the passkey on your gadget (private key) cannot be accessed without biometric identification (of the device’s owner) or a PIN, which adds extra protection.",

        "title": "Best Secure and Reliable Free VPNs for Torrenting in February 2024",
        "authors": "Will Macmaster",
        "date": "2023-08-08",
        "articleBody": "Using a VPN for torrenting is pretty much a necessity. To begin torrenting you will, of course, join a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, this means your IP address will now be just sitting there for everyone else in your p2p network to observe and maybe even to steal and do something nefarious with. So what about a free VPN for torrenting? \n\nIf we are being brutally honest, if you are planning to torrent anything even remotely sensitive we would recommend a paid version over a free VPN for torrenting. This is simply because of all the activities you can use a VPN for this is where your information will be at risk the most.\n\nNow a free torrent VPN is not always a bad option, let us not turn you off them completely and lucky for you we have done the work for you and found the three best options. When we say work as well we mean it! Unfortunately, when it comes to finding a decent free VPN for torrenting there are a lot of duds out there and you must practice caution above all else.\n\nWe noticed a lot of options did not hide our IP address well enough at all while others blocked p2p transfers. What is the point of a free p2p VPN if they block p2p transfers we hear you ask? Yes, we are wondering that ourselves. \n\nTorrenting Unlocked: Your Guide to the Best Free VPNs\n\nTaking all that criticism into account there are three free torrenting VPN options that stand out head and shoulders above the rest:\n\n    ProtonVPN– Unlimited data and reliable kill switch\n    TunnelBear– Fast speeds in torrenting-friendly countries \n    Hide.me- Best protection for torrenting \n\nBefore we get into what sets them out as the best free VPN for torrenting options let’s just give you a quick guide on what to look for. As we mentioned, above all else you need to look for the most secure options, it is NON-NEGOTIABLE that the free VPN you choose can hide your IP address, that is the first thing you need to be sure of.\n\nThe second important factor to check for is whether it will allow p2p transfers. There is zero point in joining a p2p group if the VPN will not allow you to share or download anything. A free VPN with p2p capabilities that also keeps your connection secure is 90 percent of the fight but there are some other things you should take into account too.\n\nAs with every other possible use for a free VPN speed is going to be very important and what goes hand-in-hand with this is the number of servers and data allowance. Once you think it is safe to share and download p2p files if you are faced with a very long waiting time it can cause great frustration so look for a free torrent VPN that will protect you but also doesn’t chain you down with slow download speeds.\n\nSecure Torrenting for Free: The Best VPNs to Use\n\nAs we mentioned it is slim pickings when it comes to a free torrenting VPN that is safe and works smoothly, however, let’s look at the three we found to be the best and discuss what makes them so good. \n\n1) ProtonVPN\n\nAnyone familiar with our site will have expected to see ProtonVPN in this list as there is one main reason it tends to finish in the top 3 of our ‘best free VPN for x’ lists and that is data allowance. It is extremely rare to get a free VPN that gives any sort of decent data allowance so the fact Proton gives its users an unlimited amount makes it a regular winner, but what about a free VPN for torrenting?\n\nAs we mentioned, data allowance is secondary when it comes to safety while torrenting. We found that there are no P2P optimized servers which was a bit of a disappointment, but we did manage to download the needed torrents so as a free torrent VPN goes it is still decent. You will also be well protected as they promise not to collect your data and crucially they have a reliable kill switch to protect against any accidental leak when your connection drops.\n\nWe have already mentioned the main downside when it comes to Proton as a free torrenting VPN and that is the lack of optimized servers. To be honest we are surprised that Proton still allows torrenting as for a free VPN it nearly is the whole package. It is just the way it is that for a fully performing torrenting VPN you will need to opt for a paid version.\n\n2) TunnelBear\n\nNext on our free VPN for torrenting list is TunnelBear, which is very similar to Proton in many ways but also has a few key differences both positively and negatively. That is the beauty of the three VPNs on this list, they all have different strengths and weaknesses so you can choose which one suits you best.\n\nTunnelBear’s free version has excellent speeds and although it has a small number of servers the countries you can unblock are all very torrenting-friendly ones (The Netherlands and Switzerland) so it makes the process much easier. Just like Proton, it does not have specialized p2p servers but you will be able to download the necessary torrents.\n\nThe main downside with TunnelBear is the measly data allowance you will have available to you. You will only have 500MB per month available to you so realistically you will only be able to test out its torrenting capabilities once before your data runs out. Just another reason why the paid versions are just better than the free VPN for torrenting options.\n\n3) Hide.me\n\nLast on our free torrent VPN list is Hide.me, and where it stands out is security. Anyone with torrenting experience will certainly love Hide.me because along with the general levels of security, they also allow their users to change the settings until they suit you best.\n\nWhen it comes to facilitating torrenting Hide.me is probably the best free VPN for this. It puts your privacy first and is based out of a very torrenting-friendly country (Malaysia) so there is a no logs policy. They also do not have optimized servers for torrenting but everything else is there to make downloading the necessary torrents a breeze. You will also have a 10GB data allowance per month which is pretty decent for a free VPN.\n\nWhere Hide.me falls down is its speed. We found, especially during peak hours, it was a very very slow process downloading anything. As we said none of these free VPN for torrenting options will be the full package as they are designed just to give you a taste of the good stuff in the hope you will then sign up for the paid version.\n\nWhy Free VPNs Won’t Cut it for Torrenting: A Comparison to Paid Versions\n\nAs you will have gathered by now we are more in favor of using a paid version of a VPN than any free VPN for torrenting. This is nothing against the selections we have listed above; they go further than any other free torrenting VPN option.\n\nIt is just the good free VPNs exist just to tempt you into using a paid version. It is here you will really be able to get some decent speed and quantity while torrenting and not have to worry about any data allowance. All of this while being even more secure and using optimized p2p servers. So let’s take a look at our 3 best-paid VPNs for torrenting:\n\n    ExpressVPN– The most secure connection for torrenting \n    NordVPN – The most trusted brand with years of industry experience\n    IvacyVPN – Nice extras to help torrenting \n\nThese are our rankings of the best 3 so let’s take a look at why they tested best.\n\n1) ExpressVPN\n\nNo one with any experience using VPNs will be surprised to see ExpressVPN top our list here. It tends to lead the pack when it comes to most VPN uses and that is no different when it comes to torrenting. Fast speeds, a huge number of servers, and lots of little other tricks like split tunneling make it the best all-around VPN for torrenting.\n\nYou will have a huge amount of countries to choose from thanks to the number of servers ExpressVPN has and it also has a strict no-log policy so you don’t have to worry about any of your search history being stored. If we were to pick one downside to ExpressVPN it is that it’s one of the more costly VPNs, however, it is the best so you pay for the quality.\n\n2) NordVPN\n\nNordVPN\nNordVPN - 2nd best free vpn for netflix\nis probably the only VPN that people that aren’t familiar with them would still recognize the game. That is because for years now they have been providing a top-quality product alongside a very good marketing strategy. NordVPN is a great choice for torrenting as it does everything well, especially security.\n\nWith over 5,500 different servers in 60 different countries, you can guarantee you’ll be able to use them for your p2p downloads especially since they also have specialized servers for any of these activities. However, not every server is a specialized one as some of them are not p2p friendly, it is a bit of a factor but it is the only red mark that we can give NordVPN.\n\n3) IvacyVPN \n\nIvacyVPN comes in third on our list but it is not far behind the big two of ExpressVPN and NordVPN at all. We love a lot of the features this VPN has that allow the best possible torrenting experience. A good example is port forwarding which allows you to download files much faster on your device.\n\nIts servers tend to be located in countries that allow torrenting so you can be guaranteed your safety, they also have a no-logs policy just like the other two VPNs. It also has special threat-level technology that will monitor your downloads and make sure no third party is trying to target them. The one downside to IvacyVPN is its speed, while serviceable it lacks a lot compared to the top two.\n\nFinding the Right VPN: Final Tips for Secure Torrenting on a Budget\n\nBy now we have exhausted you with information on how to find the perfect free VPN for torrenting, but there is no harm in leaving you with some final points to remember. So first and foremost you will need to decide if you want to go the free torrenting VPN route or the paid one. For security and performance reasons we recommend a paid one, but if you maybe cannot afford one or only need it for a small period of time here’s what to look out for.\n\nWe are sure you know this by now but your security has to come first. Make sure that the free VPN for torrenting you are going to use can protect your IP address, has a kill switch, and will not keep any data logs of your search history. These three are just the starting points but if the free torrent VPN you are looking at has these you should be okay.\n\nEverything else kind of comes second to security but some other factors to look out for are data allowance, server quantity, and speed. It is great if a free torrent VPN protects you but if you can’t use it for any p2p sharing or downloading it is kind of pointless. You will never get all of these together if you are not paying for a premium service but perhaps you can get one that suits your torrenting needs.\n\nProtecting Your Torrenting Privacy for Free: Conclusion and Recommendations for VPNs\n\nFor the last time (we promise!) the main thing you need to look for, be it a free VPN for torrenting or a paid version is security. As long as you are confident your data will be safe and your privacy not be breached from there you can start looking for cool added features that help you with your p2p sharing and downloading.",

We’ll review and compare each one in-depth below to help you find the one best suited to your needs. Let’s dive right in.\n1. mSpy — Overall, the Best Spy App for iPhone in 2024 \n\nIf you want to see who your children are texting and what they’re chatting about on social media and instant messaging apps, mSpy is the best choice.\n\nWhile other spy software on iPhone only lets you see the chat logs on the target device, mSpy allows you to see every message — even the deleted ones.\n\nThis is incredibly useful since your kid will probably delete certain messages and wipe chat logs if they know they’re being monitored. That said, mSpy instantly uploads everything to an online server, so you’ll have access to all the data, even if it’s deleted from the monitored device.\n\nBeyond this, it also gives you access to all the applications installed on the device, so you can delete or block certain apps if you don’t want your child to use them. The same principle applies to the internet, meaning you can block specific websites and Wi-Fi networks and see their browsing history and bookmarks.\n\nThis undetectable spy app for iPhone lets you read all incoming and outgoing emails and see all the photos, videos, and other files on the device. Plus, you’ll have the following:\n\n    Full remote control of the target device\n    The means to restrict access to certain features\n    Delete unwanted applications and files\n    Remotely lock the device\n\nThis also makes mSpy one of the best girlfriend spy apps around, although you must have consent from your girlfriend to legally and ethically monitor her phone activity.\n\n2. EyeZy — The Best Spy App for iPhone for Smart Alerts\n\nEyeZy is one of the best iPhone spy apps for parental control. Besides letting you see exactly who your child is texting and talking to, it allows you to control exactly what apps they use and for how long.\n\nIf you don’t want your child using dating apps or want to limit their time on TikTok or Instagram, you can set specific restrictions for each app with EyeZy. In addition, you’ll have full control over which websites they can visit to ensure they don’t access inappropriate content online.\n\nAnother incredibly useful feature of EyeZy is the Plans Breaker. This feature lets you see your child’s social calendar, including:\n\n    Places\n    Dates\n    The people involved\n\nIf they have a specific event saved anywhere on their phone, you’ll be up to speed and can prevent them from attending events you don’t approve of. Besides this, the best part about EyeZy is that you don’t have to constantly monitor your kid’s phone. Instead, you can use the app’s Magic Alerts to set up smart filters.\n\nThe app will automatically alert you whenever they call or text a specific person, type in a restricted word in their browser, or enter a specific location. Magic Alerts ensure you don’t miss any activity you deem dangerous or inappropriate, so you can react quickly.\n\nWith so much to offer, it’s no surprise that EyeZy is also one of the top overall best phone spy apps on the market.\n\n3. uMobix — Best iOS Spy App for Full Control Over Your Child’s Access to Social Media\n\nOne of the best spy apps for iOS, uMobix is a crucial tool for parents who want to know what their children are doing on social media.\n\nThe app enables real-time tracking of all popular social media, instant messaging, and dating apps, letting you see the complete chat history and the content your children interact with.\n\nMuch like mSpy, uMobix also lets you see all the deleted info, so your child can’t hide anything from you. Apart from checking the chat logs, you can use uMobix to create an application use schedule and restrict your kids’ time on social media.\n\nFor example, you can block access to Facebook and Instagram during school hours to ensure your kid is paying attention in class instead of mindlessly scrolling on social media.\n\nThis sort of innovation sets uMobix apart and means it’s one of our best Facebook spy apps. And, as one of the best iOS spy apps, uMobix also features a Social Online Status functionality, letting you know whenever they log into any of their social media accounts on the monitored device.\n\nThis provides an additional layer of control and allows you to leverage the screen recorder to see exactly what your kids use these applications for. in fact, with uMobix, you can even access the phone’s camera and microphone and see/hear your child’s surroundings.\n\nThis lets you “tune in” and see where they hang out, who they’re talking to, and what they’re talking about.\n\n4. Cocospy — Best for Spying on iPhones Without Physical Access to the Target Device\n\nCocospy is the best spy app for iOS location tracking. With its geofencing capabilities, you can set up marked zones on the map to get notified whenever the monitored device enters or leaves a particular area. This is great to ensure your child isn’t visiting dangerous neighborhoods or sneaking off to a party or event you disapprove of.\n\nAs well as location tracking, Cocospy excels at monitoring social media and instant messaging apps. It supports everything from Facebook, Instagram, Viber, and WhatsApp to Zoom, Skype, Tinder, and even Discord — check out our full, in-depth Cocospy review for more.\n\nYou can view the full chat logs of these apps and see any media being exchanged, including GIFs, photos, and videos. With that said, the best part about Cocospy is that you can spy on an iPhone without installing software.\n\nAll you need is access to the device’s iCloud login details, and you’ll be able to access all the data on the associated device through the dashboard. This makes Cocospy the best spy app for iPhone without needing access to the target phone.\n\nWARNING: There is a fake site set up to mimic Cocospy and scam people looking to use its services. Please DO NOT use the cocospy.com version of the site for your own security, and only use cocospy.org.\n\n5. Hoverwatch — Best Free iPhone Spy App | Track up to 5 Devices At Once\n\nHoverwatch is the perfect iPhone spy app for those with a large family. First of all, it’s free to get started, plus it’s also one of the few spy apps that lets you track up to 5 devices at once. This means you can either track multiple people at the same time or track multiple devices of the same person.\n\nEither way, it’ll be impossible for anything to slip past your radar.\n\nThat said, one of our favorite things about Hoverwatch is that it tracks multiple social media platforms at once. This includes all popular sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Telegram, Skype, and more. You can check the messages sent or received by the target device, their posts, following/follower feed, etc.\n\nSince people are way too active on social media these days, having access to your partner’s or kids’ social media accounts means you’ll know what they’re up to most of the time. Even if the target person changes their SIM card, Hoverwatch will keep tabs on the fresh card too.\n\nIn fact, it’ll also inform you that the SIM card has been replaced so that you can confront the target user about the same if possible. Additionally, getting started with Hoverwatch is pretty simple. You can start with a free account by only entering your email ID and password.\n\nThen you can download and set up the app through your online account and follow the set-up prompts. Within minutes, you’ll be in and ready to start tracking the target device. To top it off, Hoverwatch takes anonymity very seriously and ensures that you’re able to remain 100% invisible as you monitor the target device.\n\n6. XNSpy — Best Spy App for Recording Phone Calls and Surroundings of the Target Device\n\nXNSpy is undoubtedly the most feature-rich spy app on the market. Whether you want to track someone’s phone calls, messages, or social media accounts, you can rely on this app for each need. That said, one of its best tracking features is phone calls and surround recording.\n\nWhile tracking a target’s messages is a great way to get a daily update on what they’re up to, it’s the phone calls that’ll give you the actual context of what’s going on.\n\nIn addition to that, you can use the surround recording feature to eavesdrop on their conversations when you’re not in the room. After all, a lot of meaningful conversations happen face-to-face. For example, let’s assume that you doubt your partner is cheating on you.\n\nNow, you might not have enough evidence through their texts to confront them. However, if you can access their phone calls and interpersonal communications, nothing stops you from finding out the truth.\n\nIf you don’t have enough time to call through all their conversations, you can simply use the XNSpy Analytics feature to recognize their favorite callers in a jiffy. Besides all this, another important feature of XNSpy is the keylogger.\n\nWhile many other spy apps will give you access to the target device’s messages and internet history, they don’t tell you the things the target person doesn’t finish typing. There could be so many scandalous messages or search queries that were deleted midway.\n\nIf you want to know them all, try the keylogger feature. It’ll record every key typed on the target device regardless of the app it’s typed on. Interested to learn more about this powerful spy app? Check out our in-depth XNSpy review for all the nitty-gritty details.\n\n7. Spybubblepro — Best iPhone Tracker to Catch Cheating Spouses\n\nSpybubblepro has been specifically designed to help people catch their cheating partners red-handed. It doesn’t have as many features as Hoverwatch or XNSpy, and that’s actually a good thing since simplicity prevails.\n\nAt a time when you’re dealing with the emotional stress of having a cheating partner, the last thing you need is a spying app with an overwhelming number of options.  To be precise, it has only three main features — WhatsApp tracking, SMS, and location monitoring — hence why its user interface is so easy to navigate.\n\nUnder WhatsApp tracking, you get access to all your partner’s incoming and outgoing messages. This also includes the messages that have been hidden, archived, or even deleted. This is a core USP because not every spy app lets you dig out deleted messages.\n\nIn addition to this, you can also check out the media files shared by your partner over WhatsApp. If tracking Whatsapp doesn’t suffice, you can also try tracking their SMS. The tracing features are quite similar here — you can track all types of messages and media files.\n\nThe last feature is location tracking which is much more powerful than what the other apps have to offer. This feature will not only help you track your partner’s location but can also be useful for tracking lost phones.\n\nThat said, you might face a minor inconvenience in that it takes Spybubblepro about 5 minutes to break into the target device. Once that’s done, it’ll readily track the location within seconds.\n\n8. Geofinder.mobi — Locate a Target Device with just its Phone Number\n\nGeofinder.mobi is the perfect spy app for those that primarily want a target’s location without the hassle of getting to know a tool and its complex set of features. Often spy apps require you to download the app on the target device to start tracking, which can be a little tricky if you don’t have complete access to it.\n\nHowever, with Geofinder.mobi, all that you need to do to start tracking is a phone number. In fact, you don’t even need to download the app on any device, not even on the target’s phone, to get started.\n\nSimply enter the phone number, select the country code, and hit “Find.” The only catch here is that Geofinder.mobi will send a location request to the target device. This means they’ll have to approve sharing their location for you to actually be able to track them. So, unlike other spy apps, you can’t monitor them without their consent.\n\nYou can choose to send the location request by including your name in it or going anonymous. However, if you choose the latter, chances are they won’t approve your request. If you want to ensure they approve, you can also send a custom message through Geofinder.mobi explaining to them why you might need their location details.\n\nThat said, you can also choose one of many Geofinder.mobi’s SMS variants if you don’t want to make a meal of the custom SMS option. While the app will only help you track the target device’s location, it certainly does the job better than anyone else in the industry.\n\nIt’s compatible with all types of phones and network operators. This means there’s absolutely no device that can hide from Geofinder.mobi’s radar.\n\n9. Spyic — Superb iPhone Spy Application for Families and Businesses\n\nSpyic has secured a position on our top 10 best iPhone spy app solutions for one very good reason — it lets families monitor up to 5 iOS devices on one subscription and up to 25 for businesses. This is a rarity and a phenomenal bargain for the value on offer.\n\nPlus, to make matters better, it doesn’t require you to jailbreak the device(s). However, with that said, Spyic does lack features you’d find with others on this list.\n\nTherefore, whether it’s for you depends on your particular needs. For one, it does a phenomenal job at basic monitoring needs. This includes tracking iMessages and social media activity (including group messages on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger).\n\nOn top of this, businesses and parents alike will appreciate the SIM, GPS, and WiFi location-tracking abilities and geofencing alerts. With this, you’ll know where your children or employees are at any time, and you’ll receive alerts if they travel to areas you’ve prohibited.\n\nBesides all this, Spyic also gives you additional peace of mind by giving you access to monitor app usage, browse web history logs, and view all multimedia files sent and received on the device.\n\n10. Spyera — Best iPhone Spy App for Live Call Listening and Recording\n\nSpyera is the most feature-rich iPhone spy app on our list. If you want full remote access to all the target device’s features, this should be your go-to spy app.\n\nOnce you log into the Spyera dashboard, you’ll be able to change the settings and enable/disable specific iPhone features the same way you would if you physically held the device. That said, beyond full remote control of the device, we also love Spyera’s ability to set up SMS deletion keywords.\n\nIf Spyera flags any inappropriate words in the SMS, it’ll automatically delete the message without giving your child a chance to read it. This is a great way to keep them safe and prevent them from discussing certain topics that might be inappropriate for their age.\n\nAnother standout feature of Spyera is call recording. If you want to hear exactly what your child is talking about with their friends, you can record phone calls and calls on all popular messaging platforms and listen to them at your convenience.\n\nHow Do iPhone Spy Apps Work?\n\nThere are two types of spy apps for iPhone — those that require you to install the app on the device you want to monitor and those that access the data on the device through iCloud.\n\nThe former work by recording all the data on the target phone and uploading it to an online server. When you log into the spy app’s dashboard, you’ll access that server and can see the following:\n\n    Contacts\n    Call logs\n    SMS\n    Chat logs on instant messaging apps\n    Device’s location\n    Apps on the target device\n\nAnd more. The dashboard also allows you to issue remote commands, such as deleting certain apps on the target iPhone, restricting access to specific websites, blocking Wi-Fi connection, and even remotely locking the device.\n\nOn the other hand, spy apps that provide access to the device’s iCloud storage simply let you log into the iCloud from another device, whether it’s your phone, laptop, or desktop computer.\n\nAll the data from the target phone are automatically uploaded to iCloud, so you’ll be able to see messages, photos, videos, passwords, and other information once you’ve logged in.\n\nThat said, this method is only possible if you have the iCloud login credentials of the target device and two-factor authentication is turned off. If the target device has two-factor authentication enabled, you will need to disable it manually before you can start monitoring the target iPhone or iPad.\nWhy Use an iPhone Spy App?\n\nThere are several legitimate reasons why you’d want to use an iPhone spy app. The best spy apps for iPhone are most commonly used by parents of underage children who want to control their kids’ access to the internet and ensure they’re not searching for or interacting with inappropriate content.\n\nYou can also use iPhone spy apps to monitor the device’s physical location, block access to specific applications, read incoming and outgoing messages, and listen in on the calls made from the device. Here’s a quick overview of the most common reasons for using an iPhone spy app:\nMonitoring Your Child’s Online Activity\n\nThe internet has many dark corners, and it’s generally not a good idea to let your kids use it unsupervised. That said, you can’t look over their shoulders 24/7 or prevent them from using the internet when you’re not physically present.\n\nThe best spy apps for iPhone let you set up restrictions and block specific websites to ensure your child isn’t accessing inappropriate online content. You’ll also be able to review their entire internet history and set up filters, so you’re immediately notified when your child types specific words or phrases into their browser.\nMonitoring Phone Calls and Messages\n\nSpy apps are a must if you want to know who your kids are texting and calling and what they’re talking about. The best spy apps for iPhone let you review call logs, listen in on the calls, see all incoming and outgoing text messages, and read all social media chats.\n\nWith apps like Spyera, you can even set up SMS deletion keywords to preemptively delete texts that contain sensitive or inappropriate topics.\nTracking the Device’s Physical Location\n\nLocation tracking lets you see the device’s location history and set up restricted zones on the map so you immediately get notified when your child enters a specific area.\n\nThis lets you know where your kids are at all times, so you’ll know exactly if they’re at a friend’s for a sleepover like they told you or are sneaking off to a club or some other place or event you don’t approve of.\nFinding Lost or Stolen Devices\n\nIf your child’s phone ever gets lost or stolen, you can use the location tracking function of the best spy apps for iPhones to easily find the device. You can also remotely lock the phone and even delete all the data on the device to prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing the information.\nCan You Spy on an iPhone With Just the Number?\n\nNo, you can’t spy on an iPhone if you only have the phone number. If this were possible, virtually anyone could spy on you, your friends, and your children.\n\nTo monitor an iPhone device, you will either need to install the iOS spy app on the iPhone or iPad or use the spy app’s dashboard to log into the device’s iCloud, provided you have the login credentials.\nCan You Spy on an iPhone Without the iCloud Password?\n\nIf you don’t have the iCloud password, your only option is to manually install the iPhone spy app on the device you want to monitor.\n\nKeep in mind that before installing the spy app, you must notify the person using the device that it is being monitored. Monitoring someone’s iPhone without informed consent might be considered illegal in your state.\nAre There Any Undetectable iPhone Spy Apps?\n\nThe best hidden spy apps for iPhone that we reviewed in this guide are all virtually undetectable. They work silently in the background, so your child won’t know when you’re monitoring them, what information you’re reviewing, and when you’re listening in.\n\nWhile your child will know that you have the ability to monitor their iPhone and iPad, they won’t know whether you’re looking at any given point in time. That’s the true power of the best spy apps for iPhone — your kids will use the device more responsibly because they’ll know you can peek in whenever you want.\nAre iPhone Spy Apps Safe?\n\nThere are hundreds of iPhone spy apps — some are secure and reputable, while others are shady or outright scams. When it comes to iPhone spy apps, the last thing you want to do is download an unknown app from a shady website and feed all your information to a third party.\n\nThat’s why choosing an app from a trusted, reliable company is crucial. The best spy apps for iPhone we reviewed in this guide are all 100% safe, have clear Privacy Policies, and have thousands of reviews from satisfied users.\n\nThey don’t collect any of your data, nor do they have access to the online servers where the monitored device’s data is stored, meaning you’re the only one with access to the information. In addition, the best spy apps for iPhone all have state-of-the-art security features and are fully protected from hackers and other cyber threats.\nFree iPhone Phone Spy Apps\n\nWhile many shady websites might promise you free spy apps for iPhone, we’ll give it to you straight — there aren’t any you’d want to use. After extensive research, we can confidently say that most websites promoting free spy apps for iPhone are either:\n\n    Listing unverified\n    Downright shady apps — scams that don’t work\n    Promoting paid applications with money-back guarantees as “free”\n\nIf you take a moment to think about it, it won’t make much sense for someone to spend months or even years developing an app only to let people spy on an iPhone for free.\n\nAs with any software development project, a lot of time, money, and effort goes into building an iPhone spy app, and the end goal of every developer is to make a profit. The closest thing to a free spy app for iPhone would be a free trial, but even that’s a rarity in the spy app industry.\n\nThat said, if you’re looking for free spy apps for iPhone because you don’t want to commit to a monthly subscription before seeing how the app works in practice, we have good news for you.\n\nThe best Spy Apps for iPhone all have refund policies that act as safety nets. If you opt for any of the spy apps we recommend in this guide and aren’t happy with them, you can request a full refund within 10 to 14 days of your purchase.\nAre iPhone Phone Spy Apps Legal?\n\nSpy apps aren’t legal or illegal by default — their legality depends on how you use them. Spying on someone else’s phone without their knowledge or consent is considered an illegal activity in most countries around the globe. It’s often punishable by steep fines or even criminal penalties.\n\nThat said, many countries allow you to use phone monitoring apps to monitor an underage child living under your roof, even without telling them. However, this only applies if you are the legal owner of the device and the one paying the phone bills.\n\nRegardless, laws vary from country/state to country, so it’s best to familiarize yourself with all applicable laws before installing the application. To be safe, we strongly recommend obtaining the child’s informed consent before you begin monitoring the device.\n\nWhen monitoring anyone other than your own underage child, the activity is illegal in most countries. The only exception is monitoring employees using company-owned iPhones and iPads — but only after obtaining their informed consent.\nHow to Use a Phone Spy App for iPhone\n\nMost spy apps have a pretty simple installation process and an intuitive user interface (UI), making them easy to use. We’ll use EyeZy as an example to show you the exact steps you need to follow to install one of the best spy apps for iPhone:\nStep 1 — Purchase an EyeZy Subscription\n\nVisit the official EyeZy website using the link below and click the Try Now button.\n\nEnter your email, check the box to confirm you agree with the app’s Terms and Conditions, and click Continue\n\nStep 2 — Choose iOS as the Device You Want to Monitor\n\nSelect the Apple logo to proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 3 — Choose the Pricing Plan\n\nSelect the pricing plan that suits you the best. We recommend the annual plan, which saves you more than $37 per month.\n\nStep 4 — Install EyeZy on the Device You Want to Monitor\n\nDownload the EyeZy app from the Apple Store on the target device and provide the application with all the required permissions.\n\nStep 5 — Start Monitoring\n\nOpen the EyeZy website on another device and enter your login credentials to access the dashboard.\n\nConclusion — What’s the Best iPhone Spy App?\n\nmSpy is our top pick. It boasts all the parental control features you’d possibly want at an unbeatable price point. However, EyeZy is a highly renowned spy app with features like magic alerts, screen recording, and more.\n\nThe one you choose will largely depend on your needs and budget, but you certainly can’t go wrong with any of these top 10:\n\n    mSpy — Overall, the Best iPhone Spy App for 2024\n    EyeZy — The Best Spy App for iPhone for Smart Alerts\n    uMobix — Best iOS Spy App for Full Control Over Your Child’s Access to Social Media\n    Cocospy — Ideal for Spying on iPhones Without Physical Access to the Target Device\n    Hoverwatch — Best Free iPhone Spy App | Track up to 5 Devices At Once\n    XNSpy — Best Spy App for Recording Phone Calls and Surroundings of the Target Device\n    Spybubblepro — Best iPhone Tracker to Catch Cheating Spouses\n    Geofinder.mobi — Locate a Target Device with just its Phone Number\n    Spyic — Superb iPhone Spy Application for Families and Businesses\n    Spyera — Popular iPhone Spy App for Live Call Listening and Recording\n\nWe’ll close by reminding you that legally, you can monitor an underage child if they’re in your guardianship or an employee (if they’re informed of the monitoring). In many states and countries, tracking someone without their permission and awareness is illegal.",

        "articleBody": "The wireless network-connectivity problem — which largely affected public, education and enterprise users — is related to two Patch Tuesday OS fixes.\n\nMicrosoft has offered a temporary fix to Windows users for Wi-Fi related issues after a Windows 11 update that compromised wireless connections on public, education, and enterprise networks.\n\nThe move is a response to reports from Windows users that they were having problems connecting their computers to Wi-Fi networks after the rollout of December's Patch Tuesday updates to Microsoft products.\n\nMicrosoft blamed two OS updates from December's Patch Tuesday — KB5032288 and KB5033375 — for the connectivity glitches in a post on its website, and acknowledged its prevalence in affecting users of particular Wi-Fi networks over others.\n[ How to choose the best desktop-as-a-service solution ]\n\n\"As reported, you are more likely to be affected by this issue if you are attempting to connect to an enterprise, education, or public Wi-Fi network using 802.1x authentication,\" the company wrote. \"This issue is not likely to occur on home networks.\"\n\nIndeed, the problems disproportionately affected people connecting to Wi-Fi on wireless networks that have enabled fast-transition or fast-roaming, which are typically used on university campuses to facilitate seamless connectivity between various access points.\n\nIn fact, some universities — such as the University of British Columbia — alerted their students and staff about the issue before Microsoft responded and even advised uninstalling the update as a temporary measure to restore service until a vendor-supported fix was available.\nFixing the problem\n\nMicrosoft's resolution isn't actually much different than what the university advised and what many other users already applied. The company issued a Known Issue Rollback (KIR), which will cause the OS to fall back to a previous version of the code that doesn't have the problem.\n\nMicrosoft introduced KIRs in March 2021 as a service to fix non-security bugs. However, a KIE is just a temporary fix, and the company said it plans to more comprehensively fix the problem and will re-issue a patch soon.\n\nMicrosoft also advised that it might take up to 24 hours for the resolution to propagate automatically to consumer devices and non-managed business devices; however, users can restart their devices to help hurry the process along.\n\nFor enterprise-managed devices that encounter the issue, it can be resolved by installing and configuring a special Group Policy, which can be found in \"Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> ,\" the company said.\nUsers Express Annoyance\n\nMicrosoft's response didn't come quickly enough for some users, who quickly took to internet message boards like Reddit to grumble publicly about having to mitigate it themselves by rolling back the update.\n\n\"To no one’s surprise Microsoft broke things with their 'update,'\" one disgruntled user posted on Reddit. \"What better way to test than production. Just keep lowering the bar.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Community pages also lit up with people complaining of the fix, with users reporting that even newly purchased Windows laptops experienced slow or nonexistent wireless connectivity.\n\n\"My Lenovo Slim Pro 9i is just a little bit over 2 weeks old from Costco,\" reported user Sunny6887. \"After the Windows 11 KB5033375 security patch yesterday, my Internet became super slow and unusable. Google Chrome kept throwing DNS errors and other errors.\"\n\nLong-suffering Windows users have a point, as the scenario is certainly not the first time an update by Microsoft aimed at patching its software inadvertently disrupted existing services. The company has a long and storied history of having to backtrack on an update or issue new patches for problems created by its own patching system.",

        "title": "A handy hack for the Pixel's new shortcut system",
        "authors": "JR Raphael",
        "date": "2023-11-12",
        "articleBody": "All right, Pixel pals: We've talked about plenty of buried treasures you can dig up on your oh-so-Googley phone, thanks mostly to Android 12's arrival. But there's one fancy new feature you can make even more useful with a quick bit of crafty customization.\n\nI'm talkin' about the Quick Tap system introduced on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro last month and also now available on the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G.\n\nQuick Tap, in case you haven't yet discovered it, is a splendid new shortcut system connected to physical presses of your favorite phalange. Once you set it up, you can simply tap twice on the back of your Pixel's body to trigger a specific action on the phone.\n\nNifty, no? I sure think so. It's a smart time-saver and a fantastic way to create your own fast-access shortcut to whatever function you want. The problem is just that the list of available options is annoyingly limited as of now, and what'd be the most practical and logical shortcut for that setup — especially for those of us with the new Pixel 6 models — is missing in action.\n\nAs with most things on Android, though, where there's a will, there's a way. And I've come up with a super-simple method for enhancing the Pixel's Quick Tap feature and making it do the one obvious, impossibly helpful thing it won't do now.\n\n[Psst: There's lots more Pixel magic where this came from. Check out my free Pixel Academy e-course to uncover tons of advanced intelligence lurking within your current Pixel phone!]\n\nRead on, and I'll explain.\nThe Pixel Quick Tap limitation\n\nWe'll get right to it: The missing function I'm fussing about is the plain and simple ability to silence your phone within the Pixel's new tappity-tapping shortcut system. It'd be a welcome option for Quick Tap on any Pixel, really, but there's a reason it's particularly pertinent for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.\n\nThe newest Pixel devices, y'see, no longer have the handy mute shortcut every Pixel before 'em has enjoyed. On Pixels past, a quick press of the power and volume-up buttons would silence your phone in a flash. It's always been the easiest and most convenient way to shoosh your phone at a second's notice, without having to futz around with any menus or on-screen options.\n\nOn the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, though, Google eliminated that option. The reason, it seems, is that it conflicts with the awkward new setup in which the devices' power button now pulls up Google Assistant by default. Because of that, the power and volume-up combo has become the way to summon the standard power menu that actually lets you shut down or restart your device.\n\nIt's a bit of a mess, frankly, and more than a little silly. I mean, c'mon: It's called the power button — not the Assistant button! But it's also yet another indication of how hard Google's working to put Assistant anywhere and everywhere and make it as frictionless as possible for you to use.\n\n(On the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G, the same setup is also available — but unlike on the newer Pixel 6 models, if you opt not to have your power button pull up Assistant, the old power-volume-up muting shortcut still works. On the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, it just isn't present at all, no matter what you do.)\n\nNow, for the fix.\n\nThe Pixel Quick Tap expansion\n\nBy default, the new Pixel Quick Tap system can handle six different functions:\n\nWhy silencing your phone isn't part of that list is beyond me. But with about 20 seconds of tweaking, good golly, we can change that.\n\nThe trick ties into that final Pixel Quick Tap option — the one to open an app on your phone. And it revolves around a basic-as-can-be and completely free app from the Play Store called, rather appropriately, Mute.\n\nAfter much searching and experimenting, I stumbled onto this random little gem and realized it was the perfect answer to our pressing problem. It doesn't look like much, and it hasn't even been updated in almost five years. But don't let that throw you. For our current purposes, it is exactly what we need.\n\nAll you've gotta do is install the app and then open it once. You'll be prompted to allow Mute to modify your system settings — a permission it obviously needs if it's gonna be able to silence your phone for you. The app doesn't require any other permissions or manner of access, and it can't even access the internet. All it does, quite literally, is silence your phone whenever it's activated.\n\nSee where we're going with this? The next step is to open up your Pixel's Quick Tap settings — by heading into the System section of your Pixel's settings, then tapping \"Gestures\" followed by \"Quick Tap\" (again, available only on the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 5, and Pixel 4a 5G).\n\nMake sure the toggle at the top of the screen is on and active. Next, select the \"Open app\" option at the very bottom of the list, then tap the gear-shaped settings icon alongside it and select \"Mute\" from the list of choices that comes up.\n\nHead back to your home screen, and that's it: Now, anytime you double-tap the back of your Pixel, you'll feel a brief vibration and see a small visual confirmation that Mute has been activated. Your phone's media and ringer volume will shoot all the way down to zero, and Android's Do Not Disturb mode will be activated. Double-tap again, and Do Not Disturb will go back off while your volume settings pop back up to their previous levels.\n\nDoesn't get much easier than that.",

        "articleBody": "The funeral processions were held in several cities across the country on Sunday, including in the Iranian capital of Tehran.\n\nPeople also reaffirmed their commitment toward the Palestinian cause, with the commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) vowing “everlasting support” for the Palestinians. The top general drew parallels with the 8-year war Saddam waged on Iran, saying the U.S. must come to the realization that it cannot defeat Muslims through attacks and pressure. \n\n“Look at the scene in Palestine and see how ruthless and criminal our enemies are. America is repeating its mistakes of the past 45 years and thinks it will win by occupying land. America, Israel, and their allies are repeating bitter experiences of the past. Did occupying Afghanistan bring victory for them? Could they stay in Iraq after occupying it? They are gradually packing their bags to leave this region,” Major General Hossein Salami said urging U.S. politicians to heed domestic needs instead of spending money on Israel’s killing campaigns. \n\nThe general condemned Israel for its deliberate targeting of civilian sites including hospitals, schools, and homes, saying the regime is killing citizens to make up for its helplessness against Hamas fighters. \n\n“Palestine is going to haunt them forever. The more they destroy in Gaza, the more nails they hit on their coffin. Turning hospitals into war zones is nothing but a crime. Try to face off Hamas fighters directly if you believe you have the courage,” he said. \n\nSalami also noted that Palestinians will ultimately emerge victorious in their fight against occupation.  \n\n“A nation that many have sacrificed their lives for is never going down. The people of Palestine are resisting and we know that the losers of this war are America and Israel. We support dear Palestine until the end,” he continued.  \n\nThe military official pointed to the failure of the so-called Abraham Accords, saying despite constant efforts by the U.S. and Israel, public opinion has turned against the Israeli regime. \n\n“Muslim nations today have an endless resentment towards these criminals, and American and Israeli officials do not dare to show up in Islamic lands. Today, wherever you go you can clearly see the detest people hold for these two entities,” Salami stressed.\n\nDevastating Israeli attacks on Gaza have so far killed about 20,000 civilians with 70% of the casualties consisting of women and children. The United Nations has warned that there are no safe zones left in the territory and that Palestinians trapped there are spending every second fearing for their lives. The UN has also warned of deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Gaza, saying every person there is currently “going hungry”. Israel has imposed a full siege on Gaza denying people food, water, and medication, after announcing that the residents of the enclave should be treated as “human-animals.”\n\nThe U.S. has so far obstructed any international action aiming to establish a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that a halt to Israeli attacks would give Hamas the chance to regroup.",

        "articleBody": "GROTON ? Police K9 Bane is \"doing well\" and heading home from the hospital Friday afternoon after being struck by a passing car on Pleasant Street earlier this week.\n\nMeanwhile, his colleagues at the Police Department continue to search for the person behind the wheel.\n\n\"A member of our team/family is injured, and we wish him a full recovery and hope that he is back at our station begging for treats we aren’t allowed to give him really soon,\" the department said.\n\nPolice received a 911 call from a Groton resident just before 5 p.m. on Wednesday, saying a car in front of them had hit a black lab. The caller, along with two other drivers, stopped to help the dog. The vehicle that hit the dog did not stop; instead the driver continued in the direction of Ayer.\n\nBane was taken to the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in North Grafton, where he was treated for severe injuries including a broken femur, dislocated hip, broken ribs and punctured lungs. Friday afternoon, police said Bane was being discharged from the hospital and is headed home to recover with his handler.\n\n\"His next hurdle is surgery on his hip which they (doctors at Tufts) think will be done next week,\" Groton police said in an update late Thursday evening.\n\nPolice said they've only identified one of the four good Samaritans who stopped to help Bane, and are hoping the three others come forward so the department can thank them.\n\nThe police station is located at 99 Pleasant St., just a short distance from where Bane was struck. Many were quick to ask the department on social media just how the K9 got out in the first place.\n\n\"To answer the burning question of a few, sometimes, even highly trained obedient good dogs take off on their owners for unknown and unexpected reasons, zoomies, squirrels, only Bane knows,\" the department responded on Facebook. \"It takes a split second for terrible accidents to happen like what we here at GPD are going through.\"\n\nBane joined the department in September 2019.\n\nState Rep. Steve Xiarhos, R-Barnstable, who was the lead sponsor of Nero's Law, weighed in, calling the incident \"not just an attack on a police K9 but an affront to our community's safety and values.\"\n\n\"As we fervently hope for Bane's recovery, currently under the expert care of Tufts Animal Hospital, we must also focus our efforts on bringing the individual responsible to justice,\" Xiarhos said.\n\nNero's Law was signed by Gov. Charlie Baker in February 2022, and allows police dogs that are injured in the line of duty to be treated and transported to a hospital in an ambulance by EMS. The state is working to train thousands of EMTs in the handling of injured K9s before a February deadline.\n\nThe bill was proposed following the death of Yarmouth police Sgt. Sean Gannon in April 2018. Gannon was shot in the head by Thomas Latanowich as police attempted to execute an arrest warrant; Latanowich was convicted of second-degree murder.\n\nGannon's K9 partner, Nero, was seriously injured but was unable to be treated by EMS on scene due to laws in place at that time.\n\nAuthorities are asking anyone who has video or may have been in the area of Pleasant Street at the time of hit-and-run to contact them at (978) 448-5555.",

His 21-point, 20-rebound performance in a win over Westfield State earned Hunter U.S. Basketball Writers Association National Player of the Week honors on Dec. 4.\n\nHunter, who played for coaches Bobby Corazzini and Ralph Grasso at Assabet, was a Colonial Athletic League all-star and he helped the Aztecs to the 2019 Central Mass. Division 4 final. He played in every game as a freshman at Keene State, and made an immediate impact on the program.\n\nDedication in the weight room has helped Hunter fill out about 20-25 pounds over the last four years and become stronger around the basket, and he has drawn inspiration and personal growth from the 40 or so books on his shelf, including “Atomic Habits,” “Make Your Bed” and “The Maxwell Daily Reader.”\n\n“I found deep within myself,” Hunter said, “that I could become anyone I wanted to become in life, and I started to truly believe that, and I put the work in to back it up. It helped me out in every aspect of life.”\n\nReturning for a fifth year of eligibility and taking on a second major wasn’t much of a decision for Hunter.\n\n“There was no thought process,” he said.\n\nHunter will earn degrees in safety studies and construction management, but he is looking forward to growing his insurance business after graduation. Lifelong friend Sam Giberti introduced him to the industry.\n\n“He showed me what it looks like to run a business,” Hunter said. “Someone opens a door for me, I go full force.”\n\nAmong Hunter’s Keene State teammates is freshman Ryan Brooks of Dudley and Shepherd Hill Regional. Hunter and the 6-5 Brooks get to go against each other every day in practice. Brooks had a toe injury earlier in the year, Hunter said, but he came back to contribute some quality minutes against Tufts.\n\n“I’m excited to see what his future looks like,” Hunter said. “I think he will have a great career here.”\n\nHunter has been reflective recently on how quickly his time at Keene State has passed. It’s a message he shared with his young teammates.\n\n“I’m enjoying the moment,” Hunter said. “(I told them) you don’t get these opportunities very often, to play on a national level team with a bunch of good dudes that are all playing for each other. Truly cherish it because before you know it, you’ll be in my spot.”\nMore laurels for Greyhounds' field hockey staff\n\nFor the third straight season, Assumption coach Annie Lahey and her staff earned National Field Hockey Coaches Association East Region Coaching Staff of the Year honors.\n\nLahey guided the Greyhounds to a 16-7 record and a third consecutive NCAA Division 2 semifinal appearance.\n\nLahey, a Notre Dame Academy and Holy Cross graduate who grew up in Worcester, was the Northeast-10 Conference Coach of the Year.\n\nThe NFHCA will announce the 2023 National Coaching Staff of the Year on Jan. 11.\nHead of the Class\n\n? Bridgewater State freshman guard Emily Quinn of Lancaster scored a career-high 11 points to help the Bears beat Wheaton. She shot 67% from the field in three games last week.\n\n? Worcester State junior forward Aaron Nkrumah of Worcester continued his outstanding season and earned his third straight MASCAC Player of the Week honor after averaging 24.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 3 steals.\n\n? Clark junior forward Bruce Saintilus averaged 20.5 points, 7 rebounds and 4.5 steals to help the Cougars to two NEWMAC victories.\n\n? WPI senior guard Donovan Sevilla anchored an outstanding defensive effort in a pair of NEWMAC victories. The Engineers allowed just 49.5 points per game. Sevilla had two steals in a win over Salve Regina and a steal and a block to help WPI beat Babson.",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "British Tesla drivers could be owed thousands of pounds after the company failed to deliver on its driverless cars promise.\n\nThe electric vehicle manufacturer, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, is facing legal challenges after drivers were sold ‘full self-driving’ technology – that has so far failed to materialise.\n\nTesla has sold cars with “full self-driving capability” since 2016, and charges £6,800 for the add-on, after a lower £5,800 price for early adopters. However, the feature has been plagued with delays.\n\nMore than two million Tesla vehicles in America have been recalled over concerns some drivers could be misusing features in the Autopilot system, the second recall to hit the manufacturer this year.\n\nIn February, more than 360,000 of its cars in the US were recalled and their systems updated over safety fears, after a two-year official investigation was launched in 2022 into dozens of crashes linked to the technology.\n\nManufacturers are also set to be banned from marketing cars as “self-driving” or “driverless” in the UK unless technology is approved under new rules coming as soon as next year.\n\nDrivers in Britain who purchased full self-driving as an add-on to Tesla’s Model 3 are now launching legal action following the pledged feature being delayed for several years.\n\n‘Tesla asked me to sign a gagging order’\n\nEd Butler, who paid an extra £5,800 for full self-driving in 2019 on top of £55,040 for his Model 3, settled a claim with Tesla in October.\n\nMr Butler, 40, said he was led to believe through Tesla’s marketing of full self-driving that it would be added as a feature by the end of 2019.\n\nA digital brochure he received about his new car said that it would have “full self-driving capability” including a “automatic driving on city streets” feature that was said to be coming later in the year. \n\nWhile a traffic light recognition feature was installed in his vehicle in late 2020, this feature is yet to be added.\n\nTesla returned the money, including court fees with interest in a total payout of just over £8,000, after the former businessman from Oxford took it to the small claims court.\n\nMr Butler claims after a court hearing date was set, Tesla offered to settle, initially on the condition that he agree to a non-disclosure clause to prevent him discussing the settlement with anyone.\n\nDocuments of Tesla’s offer to Mr Butler, seen by The Telegraph, show that he was asked not to  “aid in any action at law” that might help others make similar claims and keep the agreement “confidential” after signing.\n\nMr Butler said he did not sign the settlement agreement until the non-disclosure and non-advice clauses were removed.\n\n“It was just kind of a fight,” he said, adding that the business appeared to have made an error in selling a product not yet approved for the British market.\n\n“They made a mistake and I can understand how they made a mistake. They’re a global brand and they haven’t thought of the consumer legislation in the UK.”\n\nMr Butler made his claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that “every contract to supply goods by description is to be treated as including a term that the goods will match the description”.\n\n‘I was told I paid for full self-driving’\n\nMazher Chishty, a public relations consultant from Hampshire, also purchased a Model 3 in 2019 and paid the almost £6,000 price tag for his vehicle to have full self-driving.\n\nBut more than four years after the purchase he said he is still in the dark about whether his vehicle will ever get the features he paid for.\n\n“When I bought my car in August 2019 I was told I paid for full self-driving. It said that this car will drive itself basically on the streets.”\n\nMr Chishty, 60, said he has now chosen to initiate legal proceedings, filing a letter before action earlier this month.\n\n“It’s now four years later and nothing has happened in relation to full self-driving. I’ve just issued proceedings against Tesla in the small claims court.”\n\nHe added: “My hopes have been totally dashed repeatedly. We thought Elon was a genius and it turns out he is a crazy maverick.”\n\nAnother Tesla driver, Andrew Smith, a lawyer from London, said he was planning to also begin legal proceedings against Tesla after buying full self-driving.\n\nMr Smith, 39, bought his first Tesla Model 3 in 2019 and was sold the same deal that promised full self-driving by the end of that year.\n\nHe said he doubted the technology would become available soon. “The fact is it hasn’t really developed at all in the UK.”\n\nA group of Tesla drivers have filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the US, where automatic driving on city streets has been released in “beta” mode to those who paid for it. \n\nThe class action, launched in September, accuses the manufacturer of failing to provide vehicles which fully drive themselves, as advertised.\n\nUS media reported that Tesla’s lawyers have responded saying “mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud”.\n\nDan Kerrigan, group litigation specialist at Harcus Parker, a City law firm, said Tesla was “obviously in real difficulties”.\n\n“It’s just straight forward. You’ve bought something that you haven’t got. It’s obviously lamentable that they have been as aggressive as they have.”\n\nSpeaking about Mr Butler’s experience settling his claim with Tesla, he said confidentiality clauses were not uncommon in out of court settlements, but that “to go further and to seek a non-advice agreement is pretty callous”.\n\n“It’s backfired and all credit to this individual who’s got through with it. You’d hope Tesla will do the right thing and refund everyone.”\n\nTesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment.",

        "title": "What a weekend of party drinking really does to your body",
        "authors": "Liz Hoggard",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "I wake with a groan, remembering last night’s free-flowing champagne. The guests were lovely but the canapés were in short supply, and I’d rushed straight from work. \n\nToday everything hurts. And the world seems much too loud.\n\nThe anatomy of a midlife hangover doesn’t make for fun reading. Make that a whole weekend of partying at Christmas - and our poor body doesn’t know what’s hit it.\n\nBut why do we suffer more in midlife? The irony is we drink less, and better, pride ourselves on taking alcohol-free days. But that doesn’t save us from a weekend of binge drinking.\n\n“You don’t go out to get drunk in the way people do when they’re younger. You want to relax and enjoy nice alcohol. And that can be done to a moderate level without any obvious physiological effect - i.e. drunkenness - but you’re still going to screw your sleep, absolutely burden your liver and impact your gut microbiome,” clinical nutritional therapist Stephanie Moore tells me bluntly.\n\nMoore is no killjoy. She relishes her red wine - but the reason she drinks in moderation is because she understands the science.\n\n It seems hard to believe as we pour that delicious glass of Pinot, but alcohol is totally toxic – so every time you drink, your body has to work to get rid of it from your system.\n\n“Let’s put it this way. If you were to discover ethanol [alcohol] today, and think, ‘Wow, this is a wonderful food additive to put in a trifle, and you put it through the food safety testing requirements, the maximum recommended limit would be a single glass of wine per year,” says Professor David Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in the Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London.\n\n\n\nHe’s no prohibitionist either, he enjoys a “very small” malt whisky and co-owns a wine shop. But he stresses we need to learn how to use alcohol more safely.  “It’s definitely more toxic than cannabis or MDMA.”\n\nIt takes the average adult liver an hour to break down one unit of alcohol (10 ml), which sounds reassuring. But multiple drinks slow how quickly your body can metabolise ethanol and pass it, and it can take up to 12 hours to completely leave your bloodstream.\n\nOnce alcohol does leave your bloodstream, blood vessels - which constrict when you get drunk, raising blood pressure - return to normal. But alcohol will still remain in your body, as it travels from the bloodstream to the digestive system, placing the burden on your poor old liver. \n\nAnd midlife tipplers suffer more, explains Dr Megan Rossi. An enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) helps break down alcohol in the liver making it possible to eliminate it from the body. But from age 50, we lose ADH. “It gets less effective at its job. And therefore more of the aldehyde, which can be toxic, lingers in the body. And that’s when people get more nausea symptoms and headaches.”\n\nWhile the liver is heroically processing alcohol it shuts up shop. Only when it has filtered alcohol from the blood, can it return to its other functions, including digestion and metabolising vitamins and minerals.\n\nBut this - dear friends - is the 12-hour mark when the hangover proper sets in, as the feel-good brain hormone dopamine plummets and we’re filled with self-loathing.\n\n“As we age our body mass changes, our muscle mass changes over time and that has an impact on what speed alcohol is processed through your system,” says Karen Tyrell, Drinkaware’s Chief Executive Officer. “Older drinkers are often on medication, and the way it interacts with the way they’re drinking isn’t talked about enough.”\n\nIt can take 72 hours for brain and body to return to equilibrium. But the good news is there are ways of recovering faster. Or avoiding a hangover in the first place. Here we ask the experts to assess the party damage - and offer solutions.\n\nWhat booze does to your body\n\nBrain inflammation\n\nAlcohol can cause initial feelings of relaxation - the so-called liquid confidence which makes us warmer, more flirtatious, but what’s actually happening is alcohol is suppressing activity in parts of the brain associated with inhibition. Even after you’ve stopped drinking, your brain and central nervous system are still affected while they process the alcohol. “We see neuro-inflammation,” says clinical nutritionist Stephanie Moore. “The brain is coated with an incredibly sophisticated blood-brain barrier, which decides what to allow into the brain that’s safe, and sieves out what’s not allowed. And so imagine a sieve that has tears in it, and chunky stuff that shouldn’t be getting through into the brain now can.”\n\nImpaired cognitive skills\n\n“It’s not just that it’s slowly pickling your brain, “ says Professor Nutt. “But people’s judgments tend to get disorganised when drunk. So it’s a question of whether you run the risk of doing really stupid things like falling over or getting mugged. Alcohol damps down your ability to stick to the rules.”\n\nThe dodgy belly\n\nAccording to Dr Rossi, a research fellow at King’s College London and an expert on the gut microbiome, alcohol makes our gut lining a little bit more leaky or permeable “which  means things that normally can’t get into our blood system from our gut start to move in, causing low-grade inflammation in the body, which makes us feel unwell.”\n\nYou might suffer stomach pain, constipation, and high stomach acid for 72 hours. “It’s a sign your digestive tract is inflamed and overactive,” says Moore, “and that you’ve almost definitely killed off some of your healthy microbes.”\n\nYou might find your dashing to the loo. “Alcohol influences the motility in the oesophagus, stomach and small bowel. Plus that leaky gut can lead to low-level inflammation, which means that your gut muscles don’t coordinate as effectively and everything becomes a bit loose,” laughs Dr Rossi. “That’s also why people get reflux.”  \n\nThe pounding headache\n\n“When toxins and nasty stuff that should stay in the gut leak into the bloodstream, you’ve got toxic blood, so to speak, and that is what causes you to feel very headachy, very delicate,” says Moore. “Your whole body can ache because the inflammation is systemic. It isn’t just in the liver and the gut, now it’s circulating around the body.”\n\nWrecked sleep\n\n“Delta sleep, particularly as we age because we’re having less of it, is critical for our long-term neurological health because that’s where our brain mends,” says Moore. “In order to get that deep cleaning, the body has to be cold enough. And while the liver, a huge organism, is processing alcohol, it generates a lot of heat which stops your body cooling down.”\n\nRavenous cravings\n\n“Alcohol stops us fat burning at night,” explains Moore. “The body’s priority is to break down that ethanol, so while the liver is prioritising that as an absolute must, it can’t do many of its other jobs around detoxification and turning body fat into ready fuel (one of the liver’s jobs at night). We are very metabolically active at night, there are lots of jobs to be done that require fuel. So that leads to people waking up at 3am  because their blood sugar has crashed. They’re getting an adrenaline surge, their heart’s pounding. And when they wake up ravenous, they just want that carb hit.”\n\nAnxiety and depression \n\nAt the party you may feel on top of the world but the more you drink in a session, it will cause feelings of tension and anxiety, because of the effects on our brain chemicals.  “The effects of alcohol are generally considered to be biphasic. At low to moderate blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) people may experience a stimulant-like effect where they have increased sociability, relaxation, and a sense of euphoria. However, as blood alcohol concentration increases, it acts as a depressant. “Dopamine is often lower during a hangover,” says Dr Craig Gunn,  Lecturer at the School of Psychological Sciences at the University of Bristol. “This may contribute to a negative mood and some of the negative effects on our thought processes.”\n\nAnd what you can do to protect yourself\n\n\nEat beans on toast  \n\nThe morning before a party Dr Rossi eats high-fibre foods (legumes, quinoa, wholegrain bread, nuts, seeds) to strengthen the gut lining. Next morning to beg gut forgiveness, she’ll fibre-load with baked beans: “the saltiness rehydrates in terms of making you drink more water and the legumes are like a good fertiliser for the gut bacteria.”\n\n“Have a fatty protein-y snack before you go out,” says Stephanie Moore, “because that stays in the stomach for a nice long time and gives the alcohol a sort of bed. A chunk of cheese or a handful of peanuts, which are way better than crisps because they’ve got fat, protein and fibre. Something rich in your stomach, not only slows how quickly alcohol is absorbed into your bloodstream, but reduces how much is absorbed.”\n\nGo for darker drinks\n\nDr Rossi recommends red wine and dark beers that contain polyphenols (plant chemicals that feed our good gut bacteria which help us fight infections). Stephanie Moore opts for a good tequila. “Serve light beer, or Campari, something that’s long, but not too strong,” says Professor Nutt.\n\nAvoid bubbles to spare your liver\n\n“Champagne and Prosecco make you drunk faster because bubbles increase the speed of the alcohol absorption in our gut,” says Dr Rossi. “And the higher our blood alcohol at any one point, the worse the hangover, because we drink faster than our liver can actually metabolise it.” \n\n“Champagne is problematic,” says Professor Nutt, “because it actually gets into the body faster, so you get that peak of drunkenness. And once you start getting disinhibited with Champagne, then what’s to stop you doing all the other things you want to do, because you’re already on that slippery slope. That’s why alcohol is such a challenging drug. Because if it dampens down your ability to stick to the rules, and of course, that’s why a lot of us drink, just to be liberated from the worries and the stresses of work.”\n\nStart drinking later\n\nNever serve anything before the meal - no aperitifs, champagne, says Professor Nutt. “Don’t give people alcohol until after the meal if you can. Then afterwards, when you’re sitting back, savour your wine with the mince pie because we know fatty food slows down stomach emptying, and that slows down the uptake of alcohol, so that reduces the likelihood of getting drunk fast.”\n\nTake milk thistle\n\n“Milk thistle is very supportive of these phases of ethanol detoxification in the liver. So take a bit with water before your big night out, or leave it on your bedside,” advises Moore.\n\nAvoid sugary mixers\n\n“Any tonic or mixer has high fructose corn syrup (brewed fruit sugar),” says Stephanie Moore. So go for vodka with soda and lime. Or a superior gin like Stin dry gin, which is so aromatic you only need ice and a slug of tonic. You also sip slower. Bland alcohol is easy to overconsume.”\n\nDon’t take Paracetamol without food\n\n“Paracetamol or any of these non-steroidal medications, can actually cause an irritated stomach,” warns Dr Rossi. “That’s why the recommendation is always to have them with food. If you can’t have both, don’t take non-steroidals because they will increase your risk of stomach ulcers.”\n\nHave 4 days off \n\n“If you are going out to party, for goodness sake, give yourself two or three days, ideally four, before you go at it again, because then your body has half a chance to mend,” says Moore. “The gut lining replenishes every two to three days, so if you have damaged it, you’re giving it a chance to reboot.”    \n\nPimp up the soft drinks\n\n“Any office party should offer kombucha or a water kefir as a non-alcoholic option, or for mixing with spirits because they’re actually good for you,” says Stephanie Moore. And Professor David Nutt has invented a very clever zero-alcohol botanical spirit, Sentia, that closely mimics the “conviviality” effects of alcohol, so we can have fun without regret.  “Alcohol works on the frontal part of the brain to relax you, and the chemical transmission in that part of the brain is through a system called GABA (the inhibitory neurotransmitter Gamma-aminobutyric acid). So if you target GABA, you can give people that first-drink effect, which takes away stress and tension.”\n\nAnd the good news?\n\n“To be honest, if you don’t drink more than the recommended limit, or don’t drink that in one go, the harms of alcohol are relatively small,” says Professor Nutt. “Loneliness takes years off your life and if there’s anything we can do to minimise that, we should do it.” “There is zero benefit to drinking alcohol from a physiological point of view, because it is gut, liver and brain toxic,” says Stephanie Moore. “However, there seems to be a benefit because of the pleasure.

        "title": "The Colorado Ruling Changed My Mind",
        "authors": "George T. Conway III",
        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "When I review divided appellate-court decisions, I almost always read the dissenting opinions first. The habit formed back when I was a young law student and lawyer—and Federalist Society member—in the late 1980s, when I would pore (and, I confess, usually coo) over Justice Antonin Scalia’s latest dissents.\n\nI came to adopt the practice not just for newsworthy rulings that I disagreed with, but for decisions I agreed with, including even obscure cases in the areas of business law I practiced. Dissents are generally shorter, and almost always more fun to read, than majority opinions; judges usually feel freer to express themselves when writing separately. But dissents are also intellectually useful: If there’s a weakness in the majority’s argument, an able judge will expose it, sometimes brutally, and she may make you change your mind, or at least be less dismissive of her position, even when you disagree. Give me a pile of Justice Elena Kagan’s dissents to read anytime—I love them even when she’s wrong, as I think she often is. You can learn a lot from dissents.\n\nLast night, I reviewed the three separate dissents in Anderson v. Griswold, the landmark 4–3 Colorado Supreme Court case holding that Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits Donald Trump from ever serving again as president of the United States. I had been skeptical of the argument, but not for any concrete legal reason. To the contrary, I believed the masterful article written by the law professors (and Federalist Society members) William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen had put the argument into play. And I had read (not to mention heard, at length, on the phone) and took quite seriously what my friends Judge J. Michael Luttig and Professor Laurence H. Tribe had to say about it here in The Atlantic—that the Fourteenth Amendment clearly commands, in plain language, that Trump never hold federal office again.\n\nTheir points were strong. But much as I never want to see Trump near the White House again, I wasn’t quite buying them. The argument seemed somehow too good to be true. And frankly, from a political standpoint, it would be better for the country if Trump were thrashed at the polls, as I think he ultimately would be. There had to be a wrinkle. I just knew it.\n\nBut last night changed my mind. Not because of anything the Colorado Supreme Court majority said. The three dissents were what convinced me the majority was right.\n\nThe dissents were gobsmacking—for their weakness. They did not want for legal craftsmanship, but they did lack any semblance of a convincing argument.\n\nFor starters, none of the dissents challenged the district court’s factual finding that Trump had engaged in an insurrection. None of the dissents seriously questioned that, under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Trump is barred from office if he did so. Nor could they. The constitutional language is plain. You can’t be president if you previously took an oath “as an officer of the United States … to support the Constitution of the United States” but “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against, or have “given aid or comfort to the enemies of,” that Constitution or the nation it charters.\n\nNor did the dissents challenge the evidence—adduced during a five-day bench trial, and which, three years ago, we saw for ourselves in real time—that Trump had engaged in an insurrection by any reasonable understanding of the term. And the dissenters didn’t even bother with the district court’s bizarre position that even though Trump is an insurrectionist, Section 3 doesn’t apply to him because the person holding what the Constitution itself calls the “Office of the President” is, somehow, not an “officer of the United States.”\n\nInstead, the three dissenters mostly confined themselves to saying that state law doesn’t provide the plaintiffs with a remedy. But that won’t help Trump. This case seems headed for the Supreme Court of the United States, which has no authority to make definitive pronouncements about state law. In Colorado, the Supreme Court of Colorado has the last word on that. And it now has spoken.\n\nYet even the dissenters’ contentions about state law made little sense. Chief Justice Brian Boatright argued that, while Colorado law requires its secretary of state to examine the constitutional qualifications of presidential candidates, it doesn’t allow her to consider whether they are constitutionally disqualified.\n\nNothing in the state statute suggests that’s the case, and it’s plainly illogical. Every qualification necessarily establishes a disqualification. If the Constitution says, as it does, that you have to be 35 years of age to serve as president, you’re out of luck—disqualified—if you’re 34 and a half. By the same token, if you’ve engaged in an insurrection against that Constitution in violation of your oath to it, you’ve failed to meet the ironclad (and rather undemanding) requirement that you not have done that.\n\nBoatright’s suggestion that the insurrection issue presents something too complex for Colorado’s election-dispute-resolution procedures is equally unconvincing. Reviewing the tabulation of statewide votes can be complicated—remember those Florida “chads” in 2000?—but the courts have to get it done, and quickly. It’s hard to imagine that assessing the undisputed record of Trump’s miscreance presents any more complexity than that.\n\nAnd no stronger is Justice Carlos Samour’s suggestion that Trump was somehow deprived of due process by the proceedings in the district court. This was a full-blown, five-day trial, with sworn witnesses and lots of documentary exhibits, all admitted under the traditional rules of evidence before a judicial officer, who then made extensive written findings of fact under a stringent standard of proof. Every day in this country, people go to prison—for years—with a lot less process than Trump got here. As for the expeditiousness of the proceedings, that’s in the very nature of election disputes: Recall, once again, Florida in 2000. And Samour’s suggestion that Trump was denied a fair trial because he didn’t have a jury is almost embarrassing: Any first-year law student who has taken civil procedure could tell you that election cases are not even close to the sort of litigation to which a Seventh Amendment jury-trial right would attach.\n\nThe closest the dissents come to presenting a federal-law issue that ought to give someone pause comes in Samour’s argument that Section 3 is not self-executing—that it can’t be enforced unless Congress passes a law detailing how it can be enforced. The majority opinion, though, along with Paulsen and Baude and Luttig and Tribe, has disposed of that argument many times over. All you need to do is to look, as any good Scalia-like textualist would, to the words and structure of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTrue, Section 5 of the amendment gives Congress the power to enact enforcement legislation. But nothing in the amendment suggests that such legislation is required—that Section 3 (or any other prohibition in the amendment) has no teeth unless Congress implants them. To hold otherwise would mean that Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment—which contains the more familiar prohibitions against state deprivations of equal protection and due process—would likewise have been born toothless. Which would mean that, if every federal civil-rights statute were repealed tomorrow, states could immediately start racially resegregating their schools. That’s not the law, and thankfully so.\n\nSo the dissents showed one thing clearly: The Colorado majority was right. I dare not predict what will happen next. But if Trump’s lawyers or any members of the United States Supreme Court want to overturn the decision, they’d better come up with something much, much stronger. And fast.",

        "authors": "Lori Gottlieb",
        "date": "2023-11-27",
        "articleBody": "Dear Therapist,\n\nI am struggling to set a much-needed boundary with my mom around Christmas.\n\nI’m a divorced mom of one, and my ex-husband and I split the holiday. My daughter is either with me on Christmas Eve and then goes to her dad’s on Christmas afternoon or vice versa, depending on the year. We’ve been divorced since she was little, so we’ve been doing this for years.\n\nOur parents live near each other, about three and a half hours away, and we both go down to see our own moms for Christmas. My mom is toxic and guilt-trips me big-time whenever I inform her that I don’t want to come visit. Last year her reaction was so bad that I became physically ill: ocular migraine, anxiety so intense I could barely speak, etc. I caved because I just couldn’t handle her nonsense.\n\nMy daughter will be 13 this year. I’ve always dreamed of a Christmas Day we could just enjoy at home, creating our own traditions. I’ve never really been able to do this, because of the split household and the lack of boundaries with my mom. This year my ex-husband has a work gig on Christmas Day, which has presented me with the opportunity to stay home and enjoy the day with just my daughter and our cats. My daughter is getting older and the years of having her at home are numbered. As of right now, my mom thinks we will be down on Christmas for our “fancy dinner.”\n\nI buckle because I’m a people pleaser and can’t handle the guilt trip. Last year she said, “I guess adopted children just love differently” in response to my saying I’d like to stay home and maybe hang with a friend instead. I’m 42 and I struggle to say no. So how in the world can I set this much-needed boundary with my mom? I have zero desire to visit. It ruins the day, and I love Christmas.\n\nDear Reader,\n\nMany people struggle to express what they want to their family members, and this is especially true during the holiday season, which comes with heightened expectations layered upon old patterns and wounds. Issues around gift-giving, visiting, travel, and hosting tend to be not just about the question at hand, but about feelings related to how individuals in the family have felt loved, prioritized, controlled, or appreciated. Because of this history, often there’s a fear of how unpleasant the conversation might be, so people either avoid having it entirely (which creates more resentment), or initiate it in a way that sounds uncaring (which creates more conflict).\n\nFor this reason, before I suggest how to set this boundary, let’s consider the way you’ve framed your holiday dilemma. You describe your mom as “toxic” and her expression of perceived rejection as “nonsense.” You might understandably find her behavior frustrating, but as soon as we begin labeling people and their reactions, any compassion for their experience diminishes and we become dismissive of their feelings. This doesn’t mean that your mom’s feelings should supersede yours. It just means that you will get better at stating your wishes when you can make space for both.\n\nTo do this, you’ll need to hold two things at once. First, as an adult, you absolutely have the freedom to spend Christmas as you wish. Second, it’s natural that your mom would want to spend this day with her daughter and granddaughter, and that she would feel especially disappointed not to at a time when it seems as if most people will be with family. For her, the “fancy dinner” tradition might be something she never had as a child and wanted to create with her own daughter (like your wanting to create a tradition with yours). Or Christmas might have been a happy time that she looked forward to every year, and looks forward to even more now that her family has moved away.\n\nIn addition to whatever personal associations your mom has with family holidays, in our culture the holidays take on extra significance because their commercialization makes them inescapable—the seasonal music at the grocery store and the mall, the ads during a TV show you were enjoying, the decorations on neighbors’ homes as you walk down the street. If your holiday isn’t coming together in the way you’d hoped, it’s easy to feel left out of something that seems to include every other person.\n\nGiven her comment about adopted children and parental love, she might also have her own long-standing feelings of “otherness” for not being able to have a biological child, if that was the case (many adoptive parents are made to feel “othered” by society), and those feelings may inform her perception of being othered once more (“Everyone else is spending Christmas with their families—yet again, I’m different”). The point is that there are many reasons she might feel anything from sad to excluded to abandoned at the idea of not spending Christmas with you and your daughter.\n\nTo be clear, none of this is your responsibility—asking you to consider her feelings isn’t the same as guilt-tripping. What I’m encouraging instead is the practice of what’s called mentalizing: imagining her internal experience while also being able to hold on to your own.\n\nWhy does this matter? It’s easy to fall into the trap of viewing a parent in a binary way—they’re good or bad, healthy or toxic—and in doing so, we become narrow-minded ourselves. In reality, her feelings are reasonable, and so are yours. By acknowledging this, you might still disappoint her, but you can approach her with empathy so that your boundary is presented less as a rejection and more as an invitation to connect with some flexible alternatives that you can both enjoy.\n\nConsidering your mother’s feelings and your own together can help you come up with an arrangement that works for you and, with that clarity, set a compassionate boundary. You might, for example, decline the usual celebration but offer to visit her the week after. Or you might decide to go for New Year’s (or, in the future, for Thanksgiving) instead of Christmas. Or you might do neither, and send her something that arrives on Christmas so she doesn’t feel forgotten, along with a heartfelt card: “Merry Christmas! We love you and are thinking of you! We’ll FaceTime you later!”\n\nAs you decide what feels comfortable, don’t forget to check in with your daughter—does she enjoy the “fancy dinner” with her grandma, or does she want to stay home with just you?  She’s old enough to have a preference, and by including her in this decision, you’ll be modeling for her that you care about how she wants to spend the holidays, and that she’s not there just to satisfy your needs. Remember to frame this without complaining about her grandma, which puts her in an awkward bind between two family members. It can be as simple as “Because your dad’s away this year, I thought it might be fun to relax at home this Christmas, and we can see Grandma on such-and-such date instead. Does that sound good to you, or would you rather go to Grandma’s that day?”\n\nNow, as for setting the boundary with your mom, you could send an email that goes something like this (I’ll call your daughter Jane for simplicity):\n\nHi, Mom.\n\nI want to let you know that this holiday season, Jane’s dad will be away, and we have the opportunity for the first time since the divorce to stay in one place and not juggle homes this year. We haven’t spent a single Christmas together in our own home, just the two of us, without the usual three-hour drive and splitting Jane’s time. Jane is 13, and I only have a few more years with her here, so we’re going to spend Christmas at home, the two of us.\n\nI know you feel disappointed, and I completely understand that. As a mom myself, I imagine I’d feel the same way if Jane wanted to spend Christmas away from home. But as difficult as that would be for me, I’d also want Jane to spend the holiday in a way that works best for her. You once said something that surprised me—that “adopted daughters love differently”—and I found that comment confusing because that’s not how I feel, and my being adopted has no bearing on how I decide to spend the holidays. At some point in her life, Jane will choose to spend Christmas with her partner’s family, or with her dad, or with her friends, and despite how much I’d want to see her, I’ll know that I’m giving her my love by supporting her wishes, and that she’ll feel closer to me because of that. That’s what I hope happens with you and me—that you can love me by honoring my wishes, and know that loving me in this generous way makes me feel closer to you.\n\nOf course, we would still like to see you, and wonder if we can find another time to come visit the following week to celebrate together. Let me know your schedule, and we’ll figure something out.\n\nWith love,\n\n[Name]\n\nOnce your boundary is communicated, your job is to manage your own response, not the other person’s. Your mom might send her usual dose of guilt, but remember: Just because someone sends you guilt, doesn’t mean you have to accept delivery. You can reply, “Mom, I know you’re disappointed, but I’m not discussing this further—let me know another day we can come visit the following week, otherwise I have to go now.” Alternatively, she might show her hurt by not responding, or talking badly about you to relatives, but that’s beyond your control. Part of setting a boundary is deciding how you will respond, and if you stay home with your daughter but still feel guilty, that’s something you’re doing to yourself. Instead, I hope that you’ll give yourself a long-overdue gift for Christmas this year: a beautifully wrapped box of self-compassion.",

        "title": "IVP Bee Schaefer Under Scrutiny by AS Members for Delay of Senate & Finance Board",
        "authors": "Alexis Crisostomo",
        "date": "2023-09-28",
        "articleBody": "UPDATED: Oct. 3, 2022] The following article and its title has been updated for clarity and accuracy regarding senate meetings and claims from members of AS members. Since the original publication of this article, a F&B chair has been appointed and a Presidential Pro Tempore has been nominated.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Sept. 27, an Associated Students (AS) Boards, Committees, and Units (BCUs) chair member sent an email to all AS entities stating that the executive branch has “severely impaired if not completely blocked” the internal functions of UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) student government. In the email, Ted Giardello, chair of the AS Living History Project, illustrated how a number of these issues can be tied back to the responsibilities of Bee Schaefer, the AS Internal Vice President (IVP). The Bottom Line (TBL) sat down with an AS senator to fact-check Giardello’s email, as well as provide some elaboration on the weight of Schaefer’s actions (and inactions).\n\nAccording to TBL’s source in the AS senate, Giardello’s claims that the senate has not been called to a meeting since last spring quarter due to Schaefer’s inability to call them to meet is correct. While the senate did meet to complete an email wrap-up vote from a previous senate meeting that occurred during spring quarter, a new senate meeting was not initiated during the summer. This inaction rendered the senate virtually frozen and unable to perform many of its functions when entering the school year. For example, without the senate meeting, all BCU actions were nullified and their chairs were not officially appointed. TBL’s sources within AS, as well as Giardello, claim that these consequences tie back to the IVP’s responsibilities.\n\n“You can’t have a requisition until the senate has approved of those minutes,” the senator explained. “So, if you buy something for an event, even if your BCU approved it and all the members were in on it, all that student money that you spend out of your pocket — you can’t get that back because the Senate has never met.”\n\nThe AS senator, who wishes to stay anonymous, also confirms that the IVP has failed to appoint a chair for the Finance and Business (F&B) Committee. Thus, Giardello is factually correct when stating that, “AS bank accounts are functionally frozen until we address this crisis.”\n\n“Without F&B, all finances of AS […] they can’t be processed,” the AS senator explained, “SEAL organizations can’t request money.”\n\n“SEAL” describes all entities under Student Engagement & Leadership. This includes campus clubs, organizations, and Greek life sororities and fraternities. Thus, because of Bee’s persisting inaction: campus clubs, organizations, and Greek life cannot request the money that UCSB student fees pay to keep them running. Requisitions put through also cannot be approved in this state of government. \n\nIn these times of stalemate, Giardello’s email claims that those who worked to keep UCSB’s student government running during the summer were not paid summer honoraria. The AS senator confirms that this is true; before becoming prominently absent from AS communications this past summer, Schaefer had advocated for summer honoraria legislation that would clarify AS legal code and smoothly provide summer workers their compensation. However, she did not call the summer honoraria committee during the summer. \n\nThis was not before she added a piece to the legislation that would ensure honoraria to AS executives, who do not have to go through the honoraria committee. Thus, the AS elected official remarked, the IVP still received pay in her absence, while those who did work over the summer did not.\n\nRegarding her absence, the senator explained that Schaefer was absent for the majority of the summer. There was hearsay within the senate that she was placed on medical leave. However, many within AS were confused to see posts on social media of the IVP in Washington for a UC on the Hill internship this summer. That was all the senator could share about her absence. \n\n“And what were the consequences for rebuffing the association and the social contract between the student body and the elected executive? The IVP collected a paycheck of $3,000 of student fees,” read Giardello’s email. \n\nThere are some items within the email that are not accurate or questionable in truthfulness. For example, the senator pointed out, the amount that Giardello uses to compare a chair’s pay to Schaefer’s is actually not $350, it is $450. However, they state that the sentiment is the same. \n\nAdditionally, the senator cannot confirm Giardello’s claim that the IVP failed to appoint a pro tempore in her absence to “ensure that they still collected their executive pay despite her absence.” \n\nIn the spring, Bee Schaefer did not appoint her pro tempore, a position who would fill in for many of the duties of IVP if she had to step away from the office. It is required by the AS constitution to appoint a first and second pro tempore by the second meeting of the elected senate. However, in her place this summer, it is remarked as an open secret that senator Sohum Kalia has performed the duties of the IVP pro tempore without the appropriate pay. This is a violation of AS legal code.\n\nGiardello and many others are calling for a review of Schaefer’s failed actions. Giardello stated in the email that there will be a senate public forum Wednesday, 6:30 PM, and invites its AS entities to “demand equal and just accountability for our entire organization, including executives.”\n\nLater that Tuesday evening, Sept. 27, Bee Schaefer sent an email to AS Entities calling the AS senate to a meeting for the first time since spring. Giardello’s mentioned public forum will occur during the meeting.\n\nThe AS member shared with TBL their sentiments regarding Schaefer’s position, saying, “The fact that student fees are going to the IVP’s paycheck when the IVP is failing to complete her duties — in my mind, that’s theft of student fees […] This is $11 million of student money that is just being held up.”\n\nThe senator calls for those who have grievances with the IVP and with how the AS has been running to platform their voices and use the forum.\n\n“Public forum is for you to speak,” they said. “Whether you’re an AS member or just a student here, this is your money. This is your rights we’re representing. If you have a problem with how it’s going down, come say something.”",

        "title": "Creating Characters We Love: the Screenwriting Process in Our Flag Means Death",
        "authors": "Executive Content Editor",
        "date": "2023-06-07",
        "articleBody": "On May 20, the Carsey Wolf Center screened two episodes of “Our Flag Means Death” (OFMD), a popular Max series about a love story between Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard. After the screening, executive story editor Eliza Jiménez Cossio joined Professor Chip Bradley from the English department at UC Davis to discuss her process in helping to write the series.\n\nOFMD follows wealthy landowner Stede Bonnet as he decides to become a pirate — with questionable success. Bonnet eventually meets (or rather, gets captured by) Blackbeard, the legendary pirate, and the two men learn a lot from each other as their relationship develops. The story is loosely based on true events since Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard are both real historical figures that did meet and sail together for a time. \n\nWhen asked about how strictly they had to follow the true history, Cossio reported, “It was there at the surface, but we never felt like we had to stick to anything.”\n\nIt was also mentioned that pirate ships were historically a hodgepodge of people from all backgrounds. Cossio commented that having a diverse writing room made it easier to incorporate both racial and sexual identity into the development of the many characters.\n\nOne aspect that OFMD is known for is its LGBTQIA+ representation. Cossio speculated the reason the show is so compelling to the audience is that it allowed queer characters to “simply exist.” \n\nRather than an identity-based show that references the challenges of being queer, the show simply incorporates the queer elements as if they were ordinary aspects of pirate life. \n\n“I like leaving space to allow the characters to focus on love rather than identity,” Cossio said.\n\nCossio broke down the writing process further for the audience, explaining that writing is a collaborative process.\n\n“It is inaccurate to say that I alone wrote Episode 4. We all outlined together. Ideas come from so many different places. I just happen to be the name on it that is meshing it all together,” she shared.\n\nTwo themes that the writers had to navigate meshing together within OFMD were the danger and explicitness of piracy and the fondness of comedy. Cossio explained that, though this may seem like a complicated mix, real life is often a mishmash of emotions just as, if not more, complex. In keeping her characters based on reality, Cossio was able to navigate the crossover between the two genres. Cossio also pointed out that the crossover created the comedic aspects of the series. \n\nShe said, “Comedy characters shouldn’t know they are in a comedy.” \n\nBonnet takes his pirating career very seriously, portraying himself comedically as out-of-place. With this seriousness, however, the writers can still incorporate the serious motifs of trauma and violence typical of a pirate film.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of comedy films and series is the jokes. Cossio explained that when writing the script, she would create “alts” — alternative jokes that essentially didn’t make it into the final script but should be recorded if a change needs to be made during production.\n\nWhen asked about allowing for improvisation, Cossio admitted that she and the writers don’t really think about this. Instead, it is the director’s job to figure out where in the script there is room for improvisation and which actors can do it. That said, Cossio said having a writer on set facilitates this process more easily.\n\nCurrently, writers are not able to involve themselves in production, which is one ability that the Writers Guild of America is advocating for in their strike. In addition to this ability, the Writers Guild of America is arguing for raises, employment guarantees, and protection against artificial intelligence.\n\nThough the screenwriting realm is a bit chaotic currently, Cossio imparted to all writers, including herself, “Writing is regenerative and creativity is always in you.”",

        "articleBody": "The Biden administration is considering raising tariffs on Chinese EVs above 25%, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\n\nThe administration has left in place Trump-era tariffs on roughly $300 billion of Chinese goods, but is now considering additional tariffs, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nChinese EVs are already subject to a 25% tariff, which comes on top of a 2.5% tariff on imported cars, The Wall Street Journal noted, adding that the current tariff has already largely blocked subsidized Chinese automakers from making inroads into the U.S. market.\n\nariff increases for Chinese solar products and EV battery packs are also being considered, according to the report. This would follow restrictions on tax-credit qualification for EVs with Chinese battery components. Starting January 1, U.S. \"foreign entity of concern\" requirements will exclude a growing number of EVs from the tax credit due to Chinese content.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal notes, increased trade restrictions would allow President Biden to appear tough on China in an election year. But high tariffs could also exclude affordable Chinese EVs from the U.S. market, slowing the rate of EV adoption and thus going against another Biden policy goal.\n\nChinese electric vehicles have elbowed in for a large part of the market in Europe. Only recently have governments stepped in with steeper restrictions on incentives for China-made models—France just this past week, for instance.\n\nhey're also strong in Mexico—where, recently, the Chinese automaker BYD started selling its Seal, one of the strongest rivals to the Tesla Model 3 yet—although it's potentially the cheaper models the Biden administration is a little more worried about.\n\nPolestar continues to see the numbers work for \"made-in-China\" with its Polestar 2, although that's a more upscale vehicle. And Polestar has found a workaround to the tax-credit restrictions with South Korea assembly for its upcoming Polestar 4, as well as U.S. production for its Polestar 3.",

        "articleBody": "Lexus is adding a less-expensive, longer-range version of its RZ electric crossover for the 2024 model year.\n\nCalled the RZ 300e, the new variant gets a single-motor front-wheel drive powertrain and 72.8-kwh CATL battery pack, versus the dual-motor all-wheel drive powertrain and 71.4-kwh pack from Prime Planet Energy (a joint venture of Panasonic and Lexus parent Toyota) in the existing RZ 450e model.\n\nSubtracting one motor drops output from 308 hp in the RZ 450e to 201 hp. But the RZ 300e is expected to offer substantially more range than the dual-motor model. Lexus estimates 266 miles with 18-inch wheels. The RZ 450e is EPA-rated at 220 miles on 18-inch wheels, and just 196 miles on the optional 20-inch wheels.\n\nPriced at $55,150 (including a mandatory $1,150 destination charge) in base Premium trim with 18-inch wheels. The RZ 300e is also $3,500 cheaper than 2023 RZ at the base level. Lexus will also offer the Premium grade with 20-inch wheels for $56,390, while the higher Luxury grade starts at $60,880.\n\nThe same wheel options and Premium and Luxury trim levels carry over for the RZ 450e. But it gets a $200 price hike, bringing the base price to $59,850 with destination. Otherwise, changes are minimal.\n\nThis is the second model year for the RZ, which is related to the Toyota BZ4X and Subaru Solterra. While Lexus has sold the UX 300e in Europe since 2020, the RZ is the luxury brand's first EV for the U.S.\n\nAs Lexus priced the RZ, it really puts the priority on features, not range. The RZ 300e now offers a bit more of the latter, while still skipping several tech features that distinguish the global version, including steer-by-wire and a steering yoke.\n\nLexus aims to go all-battery-electric by 2030—quite a bit different view than parent Toyota, which still thinks 85% of its new U.S. vehicles will still have tailpipes at that point.",

They collected over 4,000 food items, amounting to an impressive total of more than 2,600 pounds of food.\n\nThe drive wrote many heartwarming stories of students who understood the impact they could make. One father shared that his son sacrificed part of his Christmas present money to purchase food for the drive. Another student took the initiative to accompany his mother to the grocery store, ensuring that the selections were not only nutritious but also items that kids would genuinely enjoy.\n\nFinn Burrus, a 3rd-grader leader, captured the essence of the food drive.\n\n“Giving is all year round,” said Burrus. “The food we give is a present to those in need. You should help even the ones you do not know.”\n\nA special shout-out goes to Dr. Kathy Caldwell’s 5th-grade class, who demonstrated exceptional teamwork and dedication by collecting the most items. As a token of recognition, they took home the coveted can food drive trophy.\n\nSchool counselor Heather Wible, organizer of the food drive, expressed her excitement at the daily influx of donations.\n\n“The enthusiasm and commitment displayed by our students truly turned their learning into action.”\n\nThe Braelinn Stars aligned with the true spirit of the season — serving others.

        "authors": "Cam E. Kettles",
        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "Ph.D. students in Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will be paid at least $50,000 in program stipends, increasing most stipends by more than 10 percent, GSAS Dean Emma Dench announced in an email Monday.\n\nThe surprise holiday raise will also increase compensation for some in the social sciences and humanities by more than 20 percent starting July 1, 2024.\n\nThe Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers had been pushing for the increase since May, when the union collected more than 1,600 signatures for a petition calling on the University to raise yearly compensation to $48,779, the living wage rate in Middlesex County.\n\nThe new minimum is just $1,221 above the union’s requested amount.\n\n“This is a huge deal,” said HGSU-UAW steward Rachel E. Petherbridge. “I cannot overstate that this is the difference between people making rent in their current apartments or having to move.”\n\nAlthough Dench attributed the changes to the work of top University administrators, HGSU-UAW declared it a union victory, publicly announcing the news on X before GSAS.\n\nIn emails to individual departments, union stewards wrote that the raise was a “direct result” of union organizing.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the exact things that we wanted in the living wage campaign they announced that they would give,” Petherbridge said.\n\nBut despite eight months of organizing, HGSU-UAW steward Alexandra C. Stanton said that union organizers were “all a little bit surprised that this was announced.”\n\nThe union had requested to reopen negotiations over wages in July, but Harvard later rejected the request, as the contract didn’t mandate the University to engage in mid-contract negotiations.\n\nStill, Stanton said the issue was a major concern for a large sector of the union, and the “pressure really affected Harvard.”\n\nHarvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe stipend increase to $50,000 is a significant boost to individual wages for some of the school’s lowest-paid Ph.D. students, marking a new compensation structure that approaches pay parity. Though total compensation is not capped at $50,000, all Ph.D. students will make at least the minimum rate.\n\nUnder HGSU-UAW’s current contract, which expires in 2025, minimum pay varies widely. Prior to this raise, student workers in the life sciences would have earned over $4,000 more than their counterparts in humanities or social sciences in the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nIn Monday’s announcement, Dench wrote that the decision was facilitated by the GSAS Admissions and Graduate Education Working Group final report released in September, which explicitly recommended increasing stipends.\n\nThe report found that the GSAS’s financial aid was “no longer sufficient” to keep up with rising costs of living and to remain competitive with peer institutions. According to the report, Harvard pays graduate students $5,000 to $15,000 less than other universities.\n\nBut in her email announcing the change, Dench wrote that the “report’s recommendations gave us a stronger platform from which to advocate for our students.”\n\nStanton said major union wins at other universities, including significant raises won by MIT’s graduate student union in September, put pressure on Harvard to strengthen its compensation.\n\n“A union win anywhere really helps people everywhere,” Stanton said.\n\nIn her email, Dench thanked Harvard President Claudine Gay, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Hopi E. Hoekstra for “their support, financial and otherwise.”\n\n“These enhancements are the result of hard work on the part of many in the Harvard Griffin GSAS and University communities,” Dench wrote.\n\nDench did not mention the union, the living wage campaign, or specific findings from the report.\n\n“While Harvard carefully avoids mentioning HGSU in its announcement email, make no mistake that this would not have been achieved without the Living Wage campaign and the organizing of over 1600 student workers,” immunology department stewards wrote in an email to students.\n\nUnion organizers also claimed the raise was motivated in part by a desire to address predictable concerns that would become bargaining issues during HGSU-UAW’s next contract negotiation, expected to begin in 2024.\n\n“They know our contract declaration is coming up and maybe they want to put the idea in people’s heads that Harvard, just out of the goodness of their hearts, gave everybody a raise to $50,000,” Stanton said.\n\n“Now is the time for us to double down, because if we can win $50,000 a year when our contract expires, can we win an even bigger raise?” she added. “Can we win a cost of living adjustment?”",

        "date": "2023-12-12",
        "articleBody": "Since their appearances before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT have been subject to a barrage of hostile criticism in the media, including from constitutional scholars known for their advocacy for free speech.\n\nWhen asked whether they would discipline students (or, I suppose, faculty) if they called for the genocide of Jews, each president responded that the answer depends on the context of the utterances.\n\nI have taught at Harvard Law School since 1961 and began practicing before the Supreme Court in 1985 — for four years as Solicitor General of the United States — and I would have felt professionally obligated to answer as the presidents did. It does depend on the context.\n\nIn the 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that “constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or prescribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\"\n\nNow, many — perhaps most — constitutional democracies do not go this far, and courts in some nations, including Canada, France, Germany, and South Africa, have allowed criminal prosecution for what may compendiously be called hate speech. But our Supreme Court has never deviated from its principle of incitement.\n\nEven in the case that strayed the furthest from this standard — the 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, which upheld the statute that makes it a federal crime to knowingly provide “material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization” — Chief Justice John Roberts ’76 was careful to carve out free speech from the ruling.\n\nIn that decision, he wrote that, under the statute, Americans “may say anything they wish on any topic” so long as they do not speak or write “to, under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.” The three dissenters would have gone further in protecting the organizations’ speech.\n\nTo be clear, governments may withhold benefits from American members of foreign terrorist organizations under certain circumstances, and certainly governments may declare official positions condemning such organizations and their principles. But none of this includes criminal sanctions.\n\nSpeech itself is, indeed, well-protected.\n\nThe three university presidents head private institutions that are not bound in every respect by federal constitutional constraints. But each institution in various ways has declared itself committed to protecting First Amendment values over the years. So it is not surprising that their presidents would have answered that whether they would discipline or expel students for advocating genocide depends on the context.\n\nIf one seeks to follow constitutional principles, answering this question certainly does depend on the context.\n\nIn 1991, prompted by an incident in which Harvard students hung Confederate flags outside their dorm windows, University President Derek C. Bok penned an essay defending the rights of the students to display offensive messages.\n\nHe directly linked Harvard’s free speech guidelines to First Amendment principles, writing that he had “difficulty understanding why a university such as Harvard should have less free speech than the surrounding society—or than a public university.”\n\nI must admit that I have never seen such flags in recent times. Yet, even today, under the circumstances Bok faced, if I were a university president pressed to answer yes or no whether the student speech in question would subject the students to discipline, I would have to reply that, yes, it depends on the context.\n\nThe lead questioner, Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06, sought to lay a rhetorical trap for the three university presidents. But I doubt Stefanik is as principled as she purports to be.\n\nWere the facts of the event before President Bok 30 years ago to recur and the administration to fail to discipline the display of Confederate flags, would Representative Stefanik have had the same reaction? I doubt it.\n\nCharles Fried is the Beneficial Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.",

The only problem? It was Trump who made the original gaffe.\n\nRogan and his guest, MMA fighter Bo Nickal, were accusing Biden of making “no sense at all” when the host asked, “Did you hear what he said yesterday, or a couple of days ago?” He then claimed that Biden recently said in earnest that America “lost” the Revolutionary War because “we didn’t have en0ugh airports.”\n\n“Pull him!” Rogan said. “If you had any other job, and you were talking like that, they would go, ‘Hey, you’re done.’”\n\nThe two men continued to denigrate Biden and defend Trump for several minutes before one of Rogan’s producers found the video in question, in which Biden says of Trump, “The same ‘stable genius’ said the biggest problem we had during the Revolutionary War is we didn’t have enough airports!”\n\n“It’s not fake,” they told Rogan, “but he was referencing Trump saying that.”\n\nThen, viewers of Rogan’s video podcast were treated to watching his face fall as the team played him a clip of a speech Trump gave in 2019, in which he said that Revolutionary forces “took over the airports” in their victorious fight against the British—despite the fact that planes would not be invented for another couple of centuries.\n\n“Oh OK, so he fucked up,” Rogan admitted.\n\n“That’s the thing about media these days,” Nickal added, “you’ve gotta look into it.”",

It also pointed out that the Israeli occupation forces turned Al Awda Hospital into a military base and detained 240 people inside without water, food, or medicine.\n\nMeanwhile, the government media in Gaza also reported that the number of journalists killed had increased to 97, after journalist Adel Zorob was killed in a bombing in Rafah, south of the Strip.\n\nMoreover, Fadel Naeem, head of the orthopaedic department at Al-Ahli Al-Maamdani Hospital – one of the few hospital institutions still in service in the northern Gaza Strip – said that the hospital stopped working on Tuesday after the Israeli army raided it. The occupation army surrounded the hospital and arrested several doctors, nurses, and the wounded, according to Naeem.\n\nNaeem added that the hospital was out of service due to the occupation forces raiding it, and it was impossible to receive patients or injured people, despite reports of dozens of wounded in the streets due to the ongoing Israeli aggression.\n\nIn the meantime, the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgos Gerapetritis, said that negotiations to establish a sea corridor to transport essential goods to the Gaza region and Israel are progressing towards reaching an agreement soon.\n\n“We expect developments on this issue in the coming days.” He added that Greece, which is in talks with France, Cyprus and other countries, will “provide humanitarian aid mainly through its commercial fleet,” Gerapetritis said in media statements.\n\nHe explained that if necessary, his country is ready to send aid through military means, as it did last November when it sent a C-130 plane loaded with pharmaceutical and medical supplies to Gaza via Egypt.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said that it is unreasonable for the world to allow what is happening in Gaza to continue, stressing that the continuation of the Israeli war on the Strip is unconscionable and unbelievable, as he put it. WHO pointed out that the number of healthcare workers in Gaza has decreased sharply, adding that at least 200 doctors have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war.\n\nOn the other hand, the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement – Hamas, said that it renewed its bombardment of Tel Aviv with a missile salvo in response to the Israeli massacres against civilians in the Gaza Strip. The Al-Qassam Brigades said that its fighters clashed with an Israeli force of 12 soldiers, and targeted another who came to rescue them, leaving them dead and wounded in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, north of Gaza City. \n\nIn the meantime, sirens sounded in Greater Tel Aviv and the city of Rishon LeZion, the Israeli army stated that millions of Israelis were searching for shelter after the missile attack that was launched from the Gaza Strip. \n\nNevertheless, the Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Islamic Jihad movement, announced that 7 Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded after clashes it described as fierce in the Shujaiya neighbourhood, east of Gaza. The Al-Quds Brigades announced that they had bombed Israeli army crowds east of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, with missiles and mortars, and confirmed that they had caused direct casualties among their ranks and that occupation helicopters were transporting the injured. \n\nIn the same context, the Israeli army confirmed that 29 soldiers were injured in the Gaza battles during the past 24 hours, amid clashes between occupation soldiers and Palestinian resistance factions in various areas of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn addition, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that more than 2,800 Israeli soldiers have been receiving treatment in the Rehabilitation Department of the Ministry of Defense since the beginning of the war on Gaza. The head of the rehabilitation department in the Israeli Ministry of Defence said that 18% of the injured Israeli soldiers suffer from psychological symptoms.",

        "articleBody": "Tourists returned last year; office workers not so much.\n\nWith the worst of the pandemic over, people are returning to downtown Madison. Pedestrian traffic on State Street and King Street rebounded nearly to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, according to Downtown Madison, Inc.’s recently released State of Downtown Madison report.\n\nThose numbers buoyed DMI president Jason Ilstrup and a panel of local experts who discussed the report before a room of hundreds at the Edgewater Hotel Nov. 30. Strong tourism numbers for Madison, which are close to what they were in 2019,  drove much of the enthusiasm.\n\n“We already know from [hotel] room tax collection — tourists are back,” said Ilstrup.\n\n“Our leisure visitors are off the charts,” added Ellie Westman Chin, president and CEO of Destination Madison. “We’re going to continue to get those folks out of Chicago — we love them. They spend so much money here.”\n\nWhile Chin called regional tourism Madison’s “sweet spot,” she added that the airing of Top Chef, a popular cooking competition show that filmed its upcoming season in Wisconsin and airs in February, will drive even more visitors to downtown.\n\n“That’s been the little gift that just keeps on giving,” said Chin. “I cannot wait for the show to air because we will be seeing far and wide across the country that people are going to want to come to Madison and experience our incredible food scene.”\n\nMore people than ever are also living downtown; its population has grown by 40% since 2010, about twice as fast as the city as a whole. That has been driven in part by a flurry of new housing construction — the DMI report highlights a 50% increase in apartments downtown since 2011, from 7,400 to more than 11,000.\n\nOne group that has not returned to downtown Madison is office workers. According to DMI’s report, about 16.7% of downtown office space is now vacant, a number that has been climbing since 2019. The office vacancy rate rose faster this year than in 2022, jumping 3.3 percentage points compared to last year’s 2.5 percentage point increase. Office vacancy rates here are still slightly better than in downtown Milwaukee (17.6%) and Minneapolis (17.4%), and much better than the downtowns of some tech-oriented metros still reeling from the move to remote work like San Francisco. There, the office vacancy rate is about 34%, twice as high as Madison’s.\n\nBob Bruni, president of Urban Land Interests and a member of the DMI panel, said that the market was seeing a “flight to quality,” with much lower vacancy rates in new buildings than in old ones. Still, Bruni was optimistic about the market for commercial office space in Madison, pointing out that the city’s central business district is integrated with restaurants, entertainment venues, and other amenities that companies look for when seeking office space.\n\n“It’s all meshed together here,” he said, “and that’s such an advantage Madison has over so many other communities and cities out there.”",

        "articleBody": "Program supported DACA students.\n\nErika Rosales always knew the Center for DREAMers had funding for just two years. But when its grant expired and the center closed in October, she still found it hard to accept. \n\n“There's a lot to celebrate because we accomplished so much in such a short time,” Rosales says. “There is grieving that we aren’t able to continue the work or provide all of the services, resources, referrals and information that we have provided until now.”\n\nFunded through the Baldwin Wisconsin Idea Endowment — a $110,000 two-year nonrenewable grant administered through the University of Wisconsin Law School — the center provided undocumented students, DACA recipients and other community members access to culturally responsive legal representation, social services and educational career services. It also sponsored the Mexico International Study Opportunity for Learning (MISOL) program — a study abroad opportunity in Mexico for DACA recipients from UW and Dane County that allows them through Advance Parole to return lawfully to the United States. \n\nThe center’s website will continue to be available online but will not be updated. \n\nAcademic life can be complex for anyone, but especially those from immigrant communities, says Rosales, a DACA recipient herself who had to navigate college in Wisconsin largely on her own. In Wisconsin, state law prohibits undocumented students and DACA recipients from accessing in-state tuition and state financial aid, though this could change under a proposed bill authored by Rep. John Macco (R-Ledgeview) that would qualify DACA students for in-state tuition.\n\nRosales says having something like the center when she was a student would have been a tremendous support.\n\n“Somebody who is undocumented and doesn't feel safe disclosing their status is not going to know where to call for support,” she says. “The center provided confidential, accurate and specific information. I have the lived experience of being undocumented and navigating educational institutions. It’s easier for undocumented students to feel comfortable and have a sense of trust when someone has walked in their shoes.”\n\nErin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at UW Law School, drafted the initial grant proposal with Rosales. The two have been trying to secure funding through other means or find a permanent home for the program in a UW-Madison division or school, or at Madison College. They have met with the UW Campus Diversity and Climate Committee, a shared governance committee that advises the administration, faculty, staff and students on issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging to continue the work of the Center for DREAMers.\n\nLori Lopez, one of the co-chairs of the diversity and climate committee, says the committee has been working to learn more about the issues and concerns of DACA/undocumented students on campus and the work of the center.\n\n“Given how many inequities and challenges undocumented students face in higher education, our committee has prioritized this issue,” Lopez says. “We’re extremely concerned about the center’s funding running out because their work is absolutely vital for the wellbeing of undocumented students. But they also play an important role for our entire campus community.”\n\nUW spokesperson Kelly Tyrrell says the university is in the process of ensuring that information on the Center for DREAMers website is preserved online at the Dean of Students page centered on DACA students. She says the UW has and will continue to offer a variety of resources and services for DACA recipients, including the UW Law School’s Immigrant Justice Clinic. \n\nBut Rosales says the center was a space for services specific to undocumented students and DACA recipients. And Barbato says the university should support students who pay tuition to attend school and will contribute to society in the future.\n\n“I have a really hard time conceptualizing why there would be pushback on providing these basic services to students that are part of our community and enrolled in our classes and will benefit our state and our country in the future,” Barbato says. “If we aren't giving a place, giving time or giving resources to provide services for these students, we are exacerbating the stigma.”\n\nRosales says part of the challenge in achieving departmental and institutional support is because “nothing like this exists anywhere in Wisconsin. I understand that folks, departments and institutions don't know how to navigate the nuances of this work, however it certainly can be done.”",

        "articleBody": "The past couple of weeks have been an interesting and turbulent time for Michigan men’s basketball, with head coach Juwan Howard the subject of persistent chatter about his job status.\n\nWith Howard now back on the sideline, attention around the Wolverines can now shift to something a little more welcome: basketball. Following back-to-back wins over Iowa and Eastern Michigan that got it back over .500, Michigan returns to action Tuesday with a neutral-site game against Florida at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe matchup is part of an event called the Jumpman Invitational, which features the original four schools that signed apparel contracts with Jordan Brand in basketball and football: Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The event features the men’s and women’s teams from both schools, with opponents rotating over a three-year cycle. The Wolverines, for example, played North Carolina in 2022 and are set to face off against Oklahoma in 2024.\n\nEven before speculation swirled around Howard after an altercation between him and strength coach Jon Sanderson, the 2023-24 season had already been a trying one for both the Michigan coach and his program.\n\nHoward underwent heart surgery on Sept. 15 to resect an aortic aneurysm and repair an aortic valve. Because of that, he was unable to return as the Wolverines’ head coach until last Saturday’s 83-66 victory against Eastern Michigan. As Howard was away, Michigan stumbled to a 4-5 start and at one point lost five of six games.\n\nIt should get a stern test from Florida, which is off to a 7-3 start. The Gators own a pair of wins over major-conference opponents — victories against Florida State and Pitt that came by a combined 36 points — and have successfully deployed an up-tempo style of play that ranks them 16th among 362 Division I schools in adjusted tempo, according to KenPom.com. Four Florida players are averaging at least 12 points per game this season, led by Iona transfer Walter Clayton Jr.’s 16.5 points per game.\n\nThis will be the fifth all-time meeting between Michigan and Florida, with the Wolverines winning three of the previous four contests.",

        "authors": "CarolRomig",
        "date": "2023-12-12",
        "articleBody": "You’ve seen her on TV, now you’re curious about Ellen DeGeneres’s net worth in 2023. She’s made significant strides in entertainment, dipped her toes into real estate, and sealed lucrative endorsements.\n\nBut what’s the actual figure? And how does her charitable giving affect her wealth? As of 2023, the net worth of Ellen DeGeneres is $500 million.\n\nLet’s dive deep into the details and analyze how Ellen’s various ventures contribute to her financial status.\n\nEllen DeGeneres’s Entertainment Career\n\nYour understanding of Ellen DeGeneres’s net worth isn’t complete without exploring her successful entertainment career. It all kicked off with her career beginning in the late 1970s as a stand-up comedian. She quickly climbed the ladder of fame with her unique, relatable humor, marking the start of a thriving career.\n\nHer television influence began in earnest in the ‘90s with the advent of her sitcom, ‘Ellen’. It wasn’t just a commercial success; it was a cultural turning point. When DeGeneres’s character came out as gay, it broke new ground, pushing societal boundaries and cementing her as a trailblazer. This televised moment was influential, indicating her potential for greatness.\n\nIn 2003, she launched ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show,’ a hit talk show syndicated worldwide. The impact was phenomenal, securing her a prime spot in television history. The show’s success significantly boosted her net worth, making her a household name and a beloved figure.\n\nIn analyzing Ellen’s career, you’d realize her wealth isn’t just from her earnings as a comedian and host, but also from her courage to challenge the status quo. Therefore, her net worth also represents her influence and impact on the entertainment industry.\n\nReal Estate Investments by Ellen\n\nBeyond her entertainment career, you’ll find that Ellen’s real estate investments significantly contribute to her impressive net worth. She’s a savvy investor, constantly on the lookout for attractive property acquisitions. Ellen’s portfolio is filled with luxury homes, which aren’t just an embodiment of opulence but are also significant wealth-builders.\n\nHere is a deeper look into her real estate investments:\n• Investment in Luxury Homes: Ellen has a knack for identifying undervalued properties in upscale neighborhoods. She’s known to purchase these, give them a facelift, and sell them at a profit. This ‘buy-low, sell-high’ strategy has greatly boosted her net worth. \n• Geographical Diversity: Her properties are spread across the country, from Los Angeles to New York. This geographical diversity reduces the risk associated with market downturns in a particular region. \n• Profitable Sales: Ellen’s ability to sell her properties at a profit is well-documented. For instance, she bought a mansion in Montecito for $27 million in 2017 and sold it for $34 million in 2021. \n\nIn essence, Ellen’s real estate investments have played a pivotal role in her wealth accumulation of $500 million. Her strategic property acquisitions and sales of luxury homes reflect her business acumen and foresight.\n\nDeGeneres’s Endorsements and Partnerships\n\nWhile her real estate ventures have significantly padded her wealth, it’s also important to consider the impact of Ellen’s endorsements and partnerships on her net worth of $500 million. These brand collaborations haven’t only increased her visibility but also contributed to her financial standing.\n\nHer talk show earnings are substantial, but it’s her strategic partnerships that have truly boosted her fortunes. Over the years, Ellen has partnered with several major brands, lending her name and image to anything from skincare products to home goods. These endorsements are lucrative, providing a steady stream of income that complements her talk show earnings.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that her partnerships often extend beyond simple endorsements. Ellen has been known to take a hands-on approach in her collaborations, contributing to the development and marketing of the products she endorses. This active involvement not only increases the value of her partnerships but also ensures that the products reflect her brand, enhancing their appeal to consumers.\n\nCharitable Giving Impact on Wealth\n\nUnderstanding the impact of charitable giving on Ellen’s wealth, you’ll see it’s not just about money, but also about the influence she’s made through her generous donations. It’s crucial to view this through the lens of wealth management and her philanthropic influence.\n\nPhilanthropic Influence\n\nEllen’s donations aren’t simply deductions from her net worth. They’ve also elevated her public image, making her a beloved figure. This boosts her earning potential, as businesses seek to align with her positive image.\n\nTax Deductions\n\nCharitable contributions can be tax-deductible. This means the more she gives, the less she may pay in taxes. It’s a smart wealth management strategy that can lessen financial burdens while helping others.\n\nInvestment in Society\n\nEllen’s charitable acts provide a return in the form of societal impact. Her donations to educational, health, and animal welfare causes, among others, lead to tangible improvements. These aren’t monetary returns, but they enrich her life, and the lives of millions, in immeasurable ways.\n\nAs you can see, Ellen’s charitable giving impacts her wealth in complex ways. It’s a demonstration of effective wealth management and a testament to her far-reaching philanthropic influence.\n\nBreakdown of Net Worth in 2023\n\nIn 2023, you’ll find that Ellen’s net worth of $500 million is a mix of several income streams, each contributing significantly to her overall wealth. The primary source is her long-standing daytime talk show, ‘The Ellen Degeneres Show’. Revenue from the show, coupled with her production company, ‘A Very Good Production’, constitutes a significant chunk of her fortune.\n\nHer real estate investments also play a critical role. Ellen’s knack for buying and selling high-end properties, often for a substantial profit, has been a key financial management strategy in growing her wealth. This is a testament to her keen eye and understanding of the real estate market.\n\nEndorsement deals, book sales, and her lifestyle brand, ‘ED by Ellen’, further supplement her wealth. Future wealth predictions for Ellen look promising provided she continues to diversify her income streams and invest wisely.\n\nThe breakdown of her net worth reveals Ellen’s smart financial management strategies. She’s not just relying on her successful career in entertainment but diversifying her portfolio, ensuring her wealth continues to grow. It’s a strategic approach you can find inspirational and worth emulating.",

But the weather that evening in Ocean Shores got in the way.\n\nA blue sky with sparse clouds and the temperature in the high-60s caused a delay in Black’s process. Given more dramatic weather — rain, gray skies, a chill in the air, you know, Grays Harbor — is part of her intended art, she had to adjust. So instead, she chose a row of bushes that provided shade from the sun. Along with the wall of bushes, there were two trees positioned in front of the bushes that worked as a frame.\n\nBlack, donning a purple dress, explained why her art’s purpose is promoting healing through art.\n\n“I use my emotions to give me inspiration for my art and in-turn, people look at my art and heal. It’s a healing process for me and for others, but my main inspiration can come from anywhere,” Black said. “This dress is today’s inspiration, so it really just depends. Like if you were walking around and you smelled a cinnamon roll? All of a sudden you’re inspired to get a cinnamon roll. It’s sort of like that. You find inspiration everywhere, if you’re looking for it, if you’re open to it.”\n\nBlack said her purpose of healing people stems from growing up in foster care.\n\n“I was a foster child my whole life and that comes with a lot of stuff,” Black said. “It’s probably a lifetime of healing just there, especially since I was in a home that was not very kind. It was very difficult to grow up there, but I made it. And I know there are other children and other adults who are currently or have been in a similar situation, so being a survivor I feel my purpose is to not only heal for myself but to show others they can do it as well. And also for people who have gone through completely different circumstances and aren’t artistically inclined, they can still use art to heal, whether it’s a coloring book or doodling.”\n\nBlack grew up as an artist\n\n“Ever since I can remember I’ve been drawing,” Black said. “Learning shading in second grade, that was really exciting. “And then I started learning painting and then graphic design. I was sort of uninspired by those (forms) so I jumped into photography about 10 years ago. I was shooting weddings and graduation pictures and things like that, but it wasn’t doing anything for me. It was sort of a job at that point. I wanted something deeper, a deeper connection to what I was creating and putting out in the world.”\n\nWhile Black still shoots photographs for her art, she doesn’t need the perfect lighting, doesn’t need to align the f-stop, aperture and the shutter speed the way the technical side of photography does. She called those qualities the math side of photography and she finds it boring. What she shoots now, she finds it anything but boring.\n\n“Anything that doesn’t light my fire, I don’t want to participate in,” Black said.\n\nOne event in particular that lit her fire in the last few years was her move up from the Southern California desert up to Washington state in 2019.\n\n“I wake up every day really inspired,” Black said. “I have so many ideas it’s hard for me to pick one, focus on it and create it. I’m just overwhelmed by excitement and inspiration all the time.”\n\nShe said the sun drains her. That’s not good when she said she was used to seeing probably 350 sunny days per year.\n\n“When it’s moody, I feel alive,” Black said about Grays Harbor’s gray skies, rain and wind.\n\n“Previous to that I was shooting self-portraits but they weren’t nearly as, I don’t know what to call it, yummy as they are now.” Black said. “They were kind of mediocre. I created them, they were fine, but it’s the environment. I needed to be inspired by my environment. I was in the desert, which is not inspiring. So now that I’m here, I’m always inspired.”\n\nBlack knows her reason for moving to Western Washington — the rain — doesn’t make a lot of sense to a lot of other people. She’s fine with it.\n\n“At first it was, people couldn’t understand that,” Black said. “I think people know me well enough now that they just accept me for it. But when I do talk to new people about it I just explain I spent the first 31 years of my life in a place it never rained, didn’t have green anywhere, and it was dead and gross. I think people can sort of get onboard with that. But yeah, they were very perplexed at first. But I match it, you know? Just as they match the dry. People match their environments.”\n\nHer right-hand man\n\nWhile Jade has the eye for what works and she comes up with the ideas, she couldn’t execute her art without her husband Junior, whom she met and befriended when she first moved to Grays Harbor. He’s on set with her anytime he can be.\n\n“He’s my behind-the-scenes guy,” Black said. “So while I’m shooting, he gets video and picture so I can put together my behind-the-scenes-content, which is super-duper important. I need that.”\n\nJunior also hauls equipment and stands where she wants to shoot, to make sure the focus is right. Think of an actor standing on his mark.\n\n“I shoot with a baby lens, which is manual-focus only. It only has one single pinpoint of focus, the rest is blurry,” Black said. “With self-portraits, usually I would just go to my spot and hit the shutter half-way down and it would automatically focus. But since I use a manual lens, I have to focus it manually. But I can’t focus the lens and be in my spot at the same time, so he very kindly stands where I want him to. I set my focus and then he makes an X in the ground. I need that, so he is huge in my process.”\n\nIn addition to having her husband by her side, having the needed equipment and having the openness to drive all over to find the right setting, Black also draws kind of a storyboard that you might see in film or television.\n\n“When I see the picture in my head, say for example this dress, I haven’t done this yet because I wanted to do it now,” Black said. “I see this dress and I’m like ‘oh my gosh, I just got inspiration for that dress.’ So I always make my pictures in square format because to me it seems like more of a piece of art. It’s not a snapshot, not just a photograph.”\n\nBlack plans it out with a rough sketch so she can get it out of her head.\n\n“This dress is really cool, I love the shimmering of it,” Black said. “What I want to do is I want to just stand there in a pose. I want to take just a simple portrait. And then in Photoshop, I’m going to sample the same color purple and I’m going to start making my dress into smoke. So then, all right, smoke, purple, I’ll do forest, just anything that will help me figure out everything that I’m doing.”\n\nBlack said the late summer portrait was a simple shoot.\n\nWhat happens in a complex shoot\n\n“There have been other photoshoots where I need like five different shots specifically,” Black said. “I would have to plan it out so I don’t forget anything. It’s really simple to do, especially when it’s cold and you’re freezing. You know your brain function slows down, so I’ve gone out and I’ve missed things because I was so cold and I didn’t have it planned out. Whereas if everything is written down and it’s planned out, like ‘OK, I need this shot with this shot, with this shot,’ then I go through the checklist, basically. And also, if something’s not going to work I can pretty much figure it out during this phase if it’s gonna work or not.”\n\nAnd then she finds a location. When she scouts, she’s “always observant,” she takes note of a certain spot she finds interesting and then she mentally files it.\n\n“For example, this is awesome,” Black said about the bushes with the trees as a frame. “On a sunny day I can come here because it’s in the shade, except in the morning time, but I don’t typically shoot in the morning time anyways.”\n\nBlack also lists her needed props and other equipment she needs for shoots. Her shoots can take her hours away.\n\nOne of her first times shooting in the Pacific Northwest was near the Quinault Rainforest.\n\n“I had this great idea to get a bucket of red paint and have him dump it over my head while I was sitting in the forest. Sounds like a great idea right?” Black said sarcastically. “Don’t pour latex paint all over your body and your hair, it’s awful. We just drove around until I saw a spot in the forest that I wanted to go to. We pulled over on the side of the road. We went not too far from the road, we could still see it, still see the vehicle. Luckily I brought a large, plastic sheet with me to put down on the forest floor because I didn’t want to leave a mess. Sure enough, he was pouring the paint over me and I was covered in red paint. It was freezing. This was in the wintertime, it was very, very cold with very cold, red paint. After we shot I was covered in red paint. He gets me to the vehicle. Because I was covered in paint, I had to be in the back. It was an SUV with no tinted windows. So he put down the plastic sheeting and me on top. I was sort of curled into a fetal position sort of. He went back and was cleaning up. It looked bloody. It looked like a murder scene had happened. While we were shooting, a police officer drove by. He just slowed down and kind of like watched for a little, and then left.”\n\nThen Junior drove Black home as she was curled up in the fetal position, covered in red paint in the back of an SUV with no tinted windows.\n\n“It looked like I was a corpse,” Black said. “That was probably the most interesting photoshoot.”\n\nBlack also recalled a second trip where they went to the Capitol State Forest. She had him tie her to a tree.\n\n“I was nude, with a red ribbon,” Black said. “We heard gunshots in the background. We realized it was hunting season. We were imagining what that would look like if someone was looking through a scope and saw this female being tied to a tree. Luckily I got the shot and we packed up and we left. That was another very, completely Jade Black photoshoot right there.”\n\nJunior said he was “probably more nervous than anything,” during that shoot.\n\nBlack said she wanted to thank Brooke Shaden, who mentored Black.\n\n“She sort of normalized darkness for me,” Black said. “A lot of people are normally so afraid of it. I was never afraid to create darkness in my art. But she made me feel like it was OK to express things that aren’t comfortable for other people. I’m not here to make people comfortable. I want them to be very uncomfortable so they can face themselves and figure out why they’re uncomfortable. Hopefully they can identify that and heal from it. If I make light and bright, sunny, you’re just going to be like ‘oh, what a pretty picture,’ and then you’re going to walk away. There’s nothing memorable about that. But if you see something that’s dark and sort of stops you in your tracks and makes you feel uncomfortable, you have no choice but to figure out ‘why does this make me feel weird? I don’t like it.’ If you don’t like it, perfect. That’s what I want from you. I want you to figure out why. My art is not just for me. It’s for you too.”\n\nHow art helps\n\nBlack’s art is kind of like the difference between hearing a light, pop song versus hearing a song that makes you feel emotions because it’s not rainbows and sunshine, there’s depth to it.\n\n“It’s the understanding,” Black said. “I want people to know that I’ve been there, I know how you feel and you can make it through. I promise. And I will be here with you. If people don’t feel like they’re understood, they’re probably not going to heal. They’re gonna be depressed and they’re gonna shut themselves out. If I can provide any sort of solace for anybody, that’s perfect.”",

        "title": "Moderate Democrats fume over Biden hydrogen proposal",
        "authors": "Rachel Frazin",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Moderate Democrats are fuming over the Biden administration’s decision to propose significant climate change-related stipulations on the use of a lucrative tax credit for hydrogen energy producers.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a frequent critic of the administration’s climate policies, said the proposal “makes absolutely no sense.”\n\nAnd moderates who have been more supportive of the administration, like Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), are also pushing back on Biden’s rules. \n\nThe hydrogen energy issue divides Democrats, with more conservative Democrats pressing for the flexibility they say will help a nascent industry that could be important in the climate fight. Liberals argue loose rules could make hydrogen energy a climate change problem rather than a solution.\n\nHydrogen energy can be made by either using electricity to separate the hydrogen out of water molecules in an electrolyzer or through a reaction between steam and methane, a key component of natural gas.\n\nThe fuel could be a key tool for cutting emissions from industries whose climate pollution is difficult to mitigate, including aviation and making chemicals, cement and steel. \n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Biden last year provided a tax credit for hydrogen that is intended to jumpstart production of hydrogen made using low- and no-emitting power sources.\n\nBut the question of who can qualify is a contentious one, and moderate Democrats argue the administration is going too far with its new rules. \n\n“This Administration cannot keep itself from violating the Inflation Reduction Act in their relentless pursuit of their radical climate agenda,” Manchin said in a written statement.\n\nHe said that the move would “kneecap the hydrogen market before it can even begin.”\n\nManchin vowed to fight the proposal, saying: “Today’s proposed rule doesn’t just violate the law — it makes absolutely no sense, and I will continue to fight this Administration’s manipulation of the IRA.”\n\nManchin, who is not running for reelection but has flirted with a third-party presidential bid, has criticized a number of Biden administration climate policies, including its handling of a tax credit for people who purchase electric vehicles, saying it was applied to vehicles too broadly and that a new guidance is too loose on Chinese battery components. \n\nSuch criticisms sometimes leave Manchin on an island in the Democratic party, but that wasn’t the case Friday.\n\nCarper, a frequent Biden ally who chairs the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee, also criticized the guidance.\n\n“When developing the Inflation Reduction Act, we intended for the clean hydrogen incentives to be flexible and technology-neutral,” Carper said in a written statement.\n\n“Treasury’s draft guidance does not fully reflect this intent, potentially jeopardizing the clean hydrogen industry’s ability to get off the ground successfully,” he added. \n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who faces a tough reelection battle next year in an increasingly red state, also said that the proposed guidance would “undermine” the law’s goals of lower energy costs and innovation.\n\n“These new proposed rules will slow down and ultimately undermine our country’s ability to produce the clean hydrogen needed to build the energy economy of the future,” Brown said in a statement. “The proposed rules’ lack of flexibility will cut out Ohio workers and Ohio businesses from creating the energy of the 21st century.”\n\nThis pushback is not a surprise. Last month, 11 Democrats signed a letter pushing for flexible rules for the hydrogen industry. Carper was not on that letter but also sent a missive calling for flexibility.\n\nAt issue is whether to require hydrogen producers to build new clean power sources to fuel hydrogen production, or whether electrolyzers should be allowed to pull existing power off the grid. \n\nClimate hawks warn the latter could result in more fossil fuel use because it could drive up power demand in general and push planet-warming gas plants online. \n\nThey have also called for this new power to be in the same geographic region and produced within the same hour that it is used to try to limit hydrogen’s impacts on power demand overall. \n\n“I applaud the Biden administration for taking this important step to ensure that we develop a truly clean hydrogen industry,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said in a statement. “Hydrogen has the potential to be a key part of the climate solution, but only if we get it right.”\n\n“Creating hydrogen energy can be very greenhouse gas-intensive. I and others have pushed hard for high standards because if hydrogen is not clean, then it cannot be a solution for hard-to-decarbonize sectors like heavy industry, and could even take us in the wrong direction,” he added. \n\nMerkley led a letter in October pushing for stringent standards and was joined by seven of his colleagues.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) who signed the letter, also praised the rule in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \n\n“.@USTreasury’s hydrogen tax credit guidance includes the climate safeguards that will ensure the hydrogen economy of the future is clean,” he wrote. \n\n“The alternative would have made the problem worse, not better. I applaud the Biden Administration’s leadership here,” he added.",

        "articleBody": "Former President Trump on Friday said he is not a “student of Hitler” as he once again asserted immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country,” a phrase critics have said is parroting the Nazi leader’s past remarks about Jews.\n\nTrump called into conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt’s show, where Hewitt pressed Trump multiple times on what he meant when he said illegal immigrants are poisoning the blood of the country, a refrain Trump has repeated multiple times in the past week.\n\n“When you look at it, if you look at what’s coming in, we have from all over the world — not one group — they’re coming in from Asia, from Africa, from South America; they’re coming from all over the world,” Trump said. “They’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re terrorists, absolutely, that’s poisoning our country, that’s poisoning the blood of our country.”\n\n“They have people coming in — we don’t even know what the language is that they speak. We have nobody that speaks the language, and they’re loading up our classes, we’re loading up our classes, our school classes with children that don’t speak the language, that don’t speak our language,” he continued. “And nobody knows what’s going on. No, we are poisoning our country; we’re poisoning the blood of our country.”\n\nHewitt noted the comparisons critics have made between Trump’s rhetoric and Hitler, who wrote in “Mein Kampf” that German blood was being poisoned by Jews. \n\nTrump denied that he intended any racist sentiment with his “poisoning the blood” comments, and he pointed to his strong poll numbers with African American and Hispanic voters.\n\nAsked again specifically about the Hitler comparisons, Trump said:  “First of all, I know nothing about Hitler. I’m not a student of Hitler. I never read his works. They say that he said something about blood, he didn’t say it the way I said it either, by the way, it’s a very different kind of a statement.”\n\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote in her book “Confidence Man,” which chronicled Trump’s years as a businessman through his time in the White House, that Trump was given a copy of the book of Hitler speeches “My New Order” by a friend, Marty Davis, who thought Trump would enjoy it.\n\nDemocrats, including the Biden campaign and Vice President Harris, have compared Trump’s rhetoric to Hitler and argued it is the latest example of how he admires authoritarians.\n\nTrump’s allies have largely downplayed the comments, arguing that border security is a real concern for many Americans, and in some cases claiming the former president was referring literally to the way illegal drugs are poisoning Americans.\n\nHewitt at the end of Friday’s interview again gave Trump a chance to clarify what he meant with his choice of words.\n\n“Exactly what I said. People are pouring into our country unchecked,” Trump replied.",

        "authors": "Solcyré Burga",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "Thousands of solstice enthusiasts will engage in a range of rituals and activities to celebrate the winter solstice, otherwise known as the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. \n\nThis year the solstice falls on Dec. 21 for the U.S. and Dec. 22 in Europe, marking the (astronomical) beginning of winter, although there are also meteorological seasons that mark winter as starting in early December through February. \n\nThe winter solstice is also the day in which the earth’s tilt away from the sun is at a maximum, making the lack of direct sunlight notable. \n\nFascination with the movement of the sun has led people to the construction of monuments like Stonehenge in England and Newgrange in Ireland, where today, thousands of people will flock to as the solstice arrives.\n\nHere’s what to know. \n\nWhat is the winter solstice?\n\nSolstices happen twice a year, in June and December, as an official mark of the change in seasons. The winter solstice marks the day when the sun is directly over the Tropic of Capricorn, a line that is located at 23.5 degrees south of the equator and runs through countries like Chile and Australia, and is furthest away from the sun. The distance brings colder temperatures and less light. \n\nOn the day of this astronomical event, the sun is at its lowest elevation and stands in a position that does not vary for several days. That’s the reason for the term solstice, which combines the Latin words sol, for sun, with stit, from the word sistere—which means to stand still. The word solstice’s first known use was in the 14th century, per the Merriam-Webster dictionary. \n\nMore From TIME\n\nWhile the Northern Hemisphere experiences the shortest day during the winter solstice, the Southern Hemisphere has their longest day of the year. People living north of the equator see daylight for less than 12 hours, according to NASA.  \n\nAfter the winter solstice, days will get longer and nights will get shorter in the North until the summer solstice, which will arrive on Jun. 20, 2024. \nWhen does the winter solstice happen?\n\nThe date and time of this astronomical event varies year-to-year, but typically occurs either on the 21st or 22nd of December. The 2023 winter solstice falls on Dec. 21 at 10:27 p.m. Eastern Time.  \nWhat traditions are celebrated across the world?\n\nAncient civilizations have long been fascinated by the movement of the sun, allowing cultures like that of the Maya to accurately track its movement and create complex and precise calendars. Others showed their interest by constructing monuments like Stonehenge in England and the Torreon in Peru as a way to track the sun’s annual progress.\n\nSome of those centuries-old traditions remain today, as thousands of people travel to Stonehenge, which was built to align with the sun during the solstices, to watch the sunrise. The event is also live streamed on the English Heritage site.\n\nAustrians celebrate the winter solstice by traveling to Hollabrunn to watch people dressed as Krampus—a half-demon, half-goat that punishes children who behave badly during the Christmas season—playfully hit and terrorize onlookers.",

        "date": "2023-11-09",
        "articleBody": "When gathering to share a meal with loved ones, food is rarely the most important part of the ritual.  \n\n“It can be a space or time to slow down and listen to one another, to connect, to share about your day or about what's going on in your life,” says Anne Brubaker, a senior lecturer at Wellesley College who teaches a course about food and culture. “It really is like a kind of social glue. Whether it's family, friends, or people that you know less well, having a meal together is an important way that we connect.”\n\nAnne Fishel, a clinical psychologist and co-founder of the Family Dinner Project, says that much of the work she facilitates for families in her office could easily be replicated organically at home, if people shared more time around the dinner table. “When kids have a chance to bond with their parents, to feel close to their parents, to feel that their parents are listening to them, they have a chance to talk about their days or whatever is on their mind, it's like a seatbelt on the potholed road of childhood and adolescence,” she says. A 2012 report from the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that teens who have frequent family dinners are more likely to report having high-quality relationships with their parents and less likely to report high levels of stress.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly 75% of U.S. adults rank spending time with their family as one of the most important aspects of their lives. And during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 85% of parents said they frequently had shared family dinners. But now that families have returned to their normal, fast-paced lives, it can be a challenge to continue sharing meals together, with a small family unit, much less an extended one.\n\nExperts spoke to TIME about how to make the family meal work. Here’s what they said. \nBe realistic about your schedules\n\nExperts say the best way to make room for family mealtime is by programming it into your weekly or monthly schedule and giving each person a role based on their skills and bandwidth. That might mean designating someone to pick up ingredients before dinner, assigning family members different items to bring, or making the meal together if time permits.\n\nFishel specifies that a shared meal does not have to center around dinner. It might be a family breakfast or even a snack around the same time. She says some families will do “split shift dinners.” That practice means a few relatives will initially eat together, then one may leave and another may join, or perhaps someone only has time to drop by to eat dessert. The point is for families to spend time together and learn from one another through some sort of ritual.\n\nFor some families, food can also serve as a way to connect to your culture or identity. “From day to day, from week to week, even harkening back to previous generations, we're eating foods that our grandparents ate or our great grandparents ate,” Fishel says. “It is a kind of anchor for a family. It offers some stability, which is really important for adults as well as kids. It's something that we can count on that kind of reminds us who we are.”\n\nCultivating a space\n\nWhile formal dining rooms were once pivotal markers of wealth and aspirational for many family homes, experts say they are not a requirement for a successful shared meal. Fishel suggests that families try to create a space where they are sitting across from each other, so they can look at one another while eating, but emphasizes that these meals can really be done from anywhere. \n\nEach family should adapt their parameters around mealtime to their needs, says Brubaker, who notes that standing and eating in the kitchen or eating around the couch does not necessarily impact a family’s ability to connect. “There are some families who have much more formal expectations around the table like where manners and politeness are a high priority, and others who may feel like it's perfectly fine to get up from the table and walk around and come back to it,” she says. “It's really just about setting aside a shared space where you can enjoy a meal.”\n\nIn order to get the conversation going, experts suggest starting off with more structured conversation. That could look like discussing a rose and a thorn, or high and low, of the day. Fishel says that families can also integrate fun games or activities while cooking dinner or at the table that can make the meal more fun. If the meal is happening during a stressful period, she suggests starting off with breathing exercises or eating with candlelight. Playing music in the background can also help set the right tone\n\nUse technology to your advantage\n\nExperts tell TIME that families can also use technology to help them connect. That can include calling in a family member who is away during mealtime through FaceTime or Zoom, similar to how many families used video calls during the beginning of the pandemic. \n\nBut if you’re allowing technology at the table, make sure you’re being consistent with your rules across ages. That means that a no cell-phone policy should apply to both parents and their children.  \n\nAnd while sitting together and talking about each other’s days is important, experts say it’s also OK to watch television or a movie during dinnertime. “We focus less on the food itself when we're doing more than one thing,” says Brubaker. “[But] I could imagine a family sitting around watching TV or connecting while watching the show, and having the pleasure of eating at the same time and together. That could be a way to connect later by talking about both the show and the meal.” .",

While Aamir Khan's daughter Ira Khan is all set to tie the knot with Nupur Shikhare, there are others who are expected to get hitched by next year. Here's a sneak peek into the Bollywood weddings that have captured our imagination.\n\nThe daughter of Aamir Khan, Ira Khan, is all set to tie the knot with her longtime beau, fitness coach Nupur Shikhare. The couple, who often shares glimpses of their adorable moments on social media, has become a favorite among fans. Their wedding is eagerly awaited, promising a perfect blend of Bollywood charm and genuine love.\n\nTamannaah Bhatia and Vijay Varma have become one of the most buzzed-about celebrity couples in Bollywood ever since confirming their relationship. Their on-screen chemistry in Netflix's anthology film 'Lust Stories 2' sparked discussions about their connection. Tamannaah previously shared that love blossomed between her and Vijay during the collaboration on 'Lust Stories.' The duo has frequently been spotted together at various events and gatherings, solidifying their status as a much-talked-about couple in the B-town scene.\n\nIn 2023, Siddharth and Aditi Rao Hydari emerged as one of the most discussed couples, and speculation is rife that they might tie the knot in 2024.

Police said the shooter died by suicide.\n\nAuthorities said they received a tip the gunman planned to attend a lecture at a different building in the area and conducted a search but did not locate the shooter. Gunshots broke out at a nearby location about one hour later.\n\nThough Thursday's deadly attack was unprecedented, the Czech Republic has faced shooting tragedies before. The Czech Republic’s last deadliest mass shooting happened when a gunman opened fire in the southeastern town of Uhersky Brod, killing eight before fatally shooting himself in 2015.\n\n'Countries have responded with very sweeping policy changes'\n\nMass shootings are more infrequent in European countries than in the United States, said Mark Bryant, the executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks mass shootings in the U.S. The group is currently developing a database on international mass shootings.\n\n\"When we look at this incident – and we’re looking right now at 15 killed – it puts it in the top eight of all mass shootings,\" Bryant said. \"We know that this is big, but this is kind of an outlier. To add to the texture of this, the gun laws in the Czech Republic are more loose than the rest of the European Union.\"\n\nAccording to Schildkraut, the Czech Republic could mimic other European countries that have enacted stricter gun laws after rare mass shootings in response.\n\n\"Relatively speaking, in these countries where (mass shootings are) even more rare, we see it doesn’t take numerous incidents to have change and that it usually only takes one,\" she said. \"Countries have responded with very sweeping policy changes like banning personal firearms or significantly reducing access to the point where people are holding gun buybacks.\"\n\nSchildkraut pointed to mass shootings in other European countries, including the Dunblane massacre in Scotland and the Hungerford massacre in Great Britain.\n\nIn 1996, a gunman killed 16 young children and their teacher at a primary school in Scotland before killing himself. After the massacre, a resident-driven campaign called \"the Snowdrop Campaign\" eventually led to a ban on private handguns in Great Britain, NBC News reported.\n\nIn another mass shooting in Great Britain, a gunman killed 16 people and injured 15 others in 1987, which prompted the Parliament of the United Kingdom to pass the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988. The legislation bans semi-automatic center-fire rifles and puts other restrictions on firearms in the country.\n\n\"Both led to legislation regarding firearms,\" Schildkraut said.\n\nThe Czech Republic is a rarity in Europe regarding gun ownership, Bryant said. In the Czech Republic, people have to pass several tests to own a gun, he said. Still, the gun laws there are much more stringent than gun laws in the U.S., he said.\n'Copycat phenomenon of American mass shooters'\n\nOnly five countries had more than two mass shootings from 1998 to 2019, according to a study published in 2022 in the International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice that analyzes mass shootings in which four or more were killed in the U.S. and 35 other high-income countries. The U.S. had 101 mass shootings and accounted for 73% of all the mass shooting incidents in these countries during this period, the study highlighted.\n\nBut mass shootings are also rising across the globe, said Jason Silva, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at William Paterson University. Silva said he is concerned about the \"globalization of American mass shootings.\"\n\n\"There's a copycat phenomenon of American mass shooters and it's catching hold in other countries,\" Silva said, adding that Thursday's massacre in Prague \"sort of capsulated the school shooter typology we saw grow popular in the U.S.\"",

        "authors": "Sharon Goldman",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "As US states race to take advantage of the generative AI boom, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Princeton University president Christopher Eisgruber announced plans today to establish a new AI hub that will bring together AI researchers, industry leaders, and startups, in collaboration with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).\n\nIn an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Governor Murphy and President Eisgruber discussed the initiative, which will advance research and development, house dedicated accelerator space, advance the use of ethical AI, and promote workforce development — including AI skills training for over 61,000 state employees. \n\n“It’s probably the most exciting project that I’m aware of on the state side since I’ve been governor,” said Murphy, who took office in 2018. When asked whether the project could keep up with the pace of AI developments, he added that “the way we’re doing this is to shine a light on the fact that we’re doing it — it’s sort of a Kevin Costner ‘if you build it, they will come.'”\nPrinceton University AI hub comes at a ‘pivotal moment’\n\nThe AI hub news follows the launch of New Jersey’s State Artificial Intelligence Task Force in October, while in November the state announced a new policy promoting the responsible use of AI by state employees. Murphy called this a “three-legged stool” approach — one leg is around economic development, a second is around AI implications including regulatory responsibility, and the third is around training of the state workforce and pursuing better delivery of government services to state residents. \n\nEisgruber said the AI hub comes at a “pivotal moment“ to help make New Jersey an AI leader in jobs and research. “Princeton University was already starting to invest here and this will help us to invest even more aggressively around this,” he said. For example, in October, Princeton announced a Language and Intelligence Initiative (PLI) focused on large language models, and named Sanjeev Arora, a professor of computer ccience and a specialist in theoretical computer science and machine learning, as PLI’s first director.\n\nIn addition, Princeton has a long history in AI research — from Alan Turing, considered the father of computer science, who earned a Ph.D. in 1938; to Stanford’s Fei-Fei Li, who earned an undergraduate degree in 1999 and served as an assistant professor from 2007-2009; Princeton provost Jennifer Rexford, who joined the university’s department of computer science in 2005 after many years as a researcher New Jersey’s Bell Labs; and “AI Snake Oil” authors Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor.\n\nBut the AI hub “will be a bigger initiative and one that we hope that will make New Jersey and this particular hub a recognized leader in the field,” Eisgruber explained. “This is a front burner for us…we expect to be pushing the accelerator.”\nA focus on AI talent\n\nThe current AI boom is highly concentrated — A Brookings 2021 analysis of the “geography of AI” called the San Francisco Bay Area a “superstar” region, while 35 of the companies on the 2023 Forbes AI 50 are California-based.\n\n??At a dinner last year with AI industry leaders in California’s Bay Area, Murphy asked why AI companies were based there. “The singular answer was talent,” he said. “It wasn’t that got status from California or the tax rate or certain infrastructure. It was talent, talent, talent — and I walked away from that dinner sort of transformed, because we’ve got as much talent, particularly in the STEM space, as anyplace in the world, in particular when you lead with Princeton.” Murphy explained that when he followed up by asking whether New Jersey had a shot at becoming the East Coast AI hub, “not one person said you’re off base — whether or not we can actually execute on all this, time will tell. But we start with the raw material that I think no other state, no other university, really brings to the table.”\n\nEisgruber said that Princeton, which has also invested in public-private AI partnerships such as its Google AI Lab in 2019, is keen to collaborate across the broader economy of New Jersey, which is a leader in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. “We need to work more with the regional ecosystem around us and one of the things that is just exciting about this hub is an opportunity for us to do that,” he said.\n\nGovernor Murphy emphasized that after launch, the plans for the hub as far as how it will evolve will be fluid — but that time was of the essence in the fast-paced world of AI. “I don’t think we’re going to let a lot of grass grow given the pace of development here.”",

        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "A massive open-source AI dataset, LAION-5B, which has been used to train popular AI text-to-image generators like Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Google’s Imagen, contains at least 1,008 instances of child sexual abuse material, a new report from the Stanford Internet Observatory found — with thousands more instances suspected. The Stanford Internet Observatory is a program of the Cyber Policy Center, a joint initiative of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Stanford Law School.\n\nThe LAION-5B dataset, which was released in March 2022 and contains more than 5 billion images and related captions from the internet, may also include thousands of additional pieces of suspected child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, according to the report. The report warned that CSAM material in the dataset could enable AI products built on this data to output new and potentially realistic child abuse content.\n\nIn response, LAION told 404 Media on Tuesday that out of “an abundance of caution,” it was taking down its datasets temporarily “to ensure they are safe before republishing them.”\nLAION datasets have come under fire before\n\nBut this is not the first time LAION’s image datasets has come under fire. As far back as October 2021, cognitive scientist Abeba Birhane, currently a senior fellow in trustworthy AI at Mozilla, published a paper, Multimodal datasets: misogyny, pornography, and malignant stereotypes, which examined LAION-400M, an earlier image dataset. It found that the dataset contained “troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of rape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other extremely problematic content.” \n\nIn September 2022, there was an instance of an artist discovering private medical record photos taken by her doctor in 2013 referenced in the LAION-5B image dataset. The artist, Lapine, discovered the photos on the Have I Been Trained website, which allows people to look for their work in popular AI training datasets.\n\nAnd a class-action lawsuit, Andersen et al. v. Stability AI LTD et al., was brought by visual artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz against Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt in January 2023. While LAION was not sued, it was named in the lawsuit, which said that “Stability is alleged to have ‘downloaded of otherwise acquired copies of billions of copyrighted images without permission to create Stable Diffusion’ known as ‘training images.’ Over five billion images were scraped (and thereby copied) from the internet for training purposes for Stable Diffusion through the services of an organization (LAION, Large-Scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network) paid by Stability.”  \n\nOrtiz, an award-winning artist who has worked for Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Marvel Film Studios, Universal Studios and HBO, spoke at a virtual FTC panel in October and discussed the LAION-5B dataset.\n\n“LAION-5B is a dataset that contains 5.8 billion text and image pairs, which…includes the entirety of my work and the work of almost everyone I know,” she said. “Beyond intellectual property, data sets like LAION-5B also contain deeply concerning material like private medical records, non consensual pornography, images of children, even social media pictures of our actual faces.”\nAI pioneer Andrew Ng has criticized removing access to LAION\n\nAs VentureBeat reported in September, Andrew Ng, former co-founder and head of Google Brain, has made no bones about the fact that the latest advances in machine learning have depended on free access to large quantities of data, much of it scraped from the open internet. \n\nIn an issue of his DeepLearning.ai newsletter, The Batch, titled “It’s Time to Update Copyright for Generative AI, he wrote that a lack of access to massive popular datasets such as  Common Crawl, The Pile, and LAION would put the brakes on progress or at least radically alter the economics of current research. \n\n“This would degrade AI’s current and future benefits in areas such as art, education, drug development, and manufacturing, to name a few,” he said. \n\nAnd in the June 7 edition of The Batch, Ng admitted that the AI community is entering an era in which it will be called upon to be more transparent in our collection and use of data. “We shouldn’t take resources like LAION for granted, because we may not always have permission to use them,” he wrote. \n\nLAION was founded to create an open-source dataset\n\nHamburg, Germany-based high school teacher and trained actor Christoph Schuhmann helped found LAION, short for “Large-scale AI Open Network. According to an April 2023 Bloomberg article, Schuhmann was hanging out on a Discord server for AI enthusiasts and was inspired by the first iteration of OpenAI’s DALL-E to make sure there would be an open-source dataset to help train image-to-text diffusion models.\n\n“Within a few weeks, Schuhmann and his colleagues had 3 million image-text pairs. After three months, they released a dataset with 400 million pairs,” the Bloomberg article said. “That number is now over 5 billion, making LAION the largest free dataset of images and captions.”\n\nSince then, the nonprofit LAION has weighed in publicly on open-source AI topics: For example, after an open letter in March 2023 calling for AI ‘pause’ heated up a fierce debate around risks vs. hype, LAION called for accelerating research and establishing a joint, international computing cluster for large-scale open-source artificial intelligence models.\nLAION was scraped from visual data on shopping sites\n\nLAION was scraped, in part, by using visual data from online shopping services such as Shopify, eBay and Amazon. In a recent paper from the Allen Institute for AI called “What’s in My Big Data?“, researchers studied LAION-2B-en, a subset of LAION-5B, which is 2.32 billion photo captions in English. It found, for example, that 6% of the documents in LAION-2B-en were from Shopify.\n\n“That was a surprise because no one had looked at that before,” Jesse Dodge, a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, told VentureBeat in November. “No one had been able to say like, what parts of the internet is the most images of text from in this dataset?”",

        "title": "Trump’s inner circle: Who are Donald’s four most trusted insiders on 2024 team?",
        "authors": "Julia Johnson",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Former President Donald Trump‘s circle has shifted and tightened over the course of several years and three presidential campaigns. What has resulted is a practically leak-proof team of trusted veterans advising Trump and his White House bid going into 2024.\n\nIn the past, Trump was seen as an outsider and his campaign operation was viewed as easily penetrable by reporters looking for information. This is no longer the case. \n\nHERE’S WHERE YOU CAN EXPECT TO HAVE A CHANCE OF SNOW IN THE US THIS CHRISTMAS\n\nNow, the campaign effort operates as a well-oiled machine. “In years and cycles past, there’s always been a level of infighting and trying to climb over one another to the top. That’s not happening now,” one source close to Trump told NBC News. “While there are some frustrations with individuals at times, there’s no alienation.”\n\nThis is in part due to his top four advisers, some of whom have been around since the beginning, while others are relatively new additions. \n\nSusie Wiles\n\nSusie Wiles is one of Trump’s 2024 campaign managers but boasts a close history with his primary rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL).\n\nWiles has worked in prominent positions over the years to help elect both Trump and DeSantis. In her capacity alongside DeSantis, she grew to one of the more powerful individuals in his circle, who was charged with plotting his course to a larger national profile and the presidency.\n\nBut when the two had a bitter falling out, reportedly due to questions DeSantis had about her loyalty, he looked to blackball her in political circles. This effort failed.\n\nNow, as Trump’s top campaign official, Wiles has led the former president in his bid to become the Republican nominee once again—which is looking increasingly likely. Per NBC News, current and former aides to Wiles touted her ability to instill discipline in a team and the respect she commands, even from those who don’t like her.\n\nChris LaCivita\n\nChris LaCivita was a newer addition to Trump’s effort. New additions have become increasingly less frequent in Trump-world as demonstrated loyalty and trust are viewed as the most important attributes.\n\nSpeculation of LaCivita’s addition swirled in 2022, prior to Trump’s campaign announcement. However, he didn’t comment at the time.\n\nLaCivita, now campaign manager alongside Wiles, is a veteran Republican strategist in Virginia, once serving as political director for the National Republican Senate Committee. Despite his more recent entrance to the team, he’s managed to uphold the same loyalty as those with longer-spanning relationships with the former president.\n\nMemos with the campaign’s most important information are often released from both Wiles and LaCivita, highlighting their duel role.\n\nJason Miller\n\nJason Miller has been an adviser on Trump’s side since 2016 and returned in 2020, and once again to his campaign in 2024 to drive it to success. His role in the 2024 effort is that of senior adviser.\n\nMiller speaks frequently with the press, often commenting on developments in the primary campaign and dispelling speculation over Trump’s next moves.\n\nHe told NBC News that Trump, “likes to get multiple opinions from people who have distinctly different perspectives, because far too often, political leaders will only get opinions from one side and only get opinions from people who have personal interest in how a decision plays out.”\n\n“Getting input from a number of places and then coming to his own conclusion has always been one of his strengths as a leader,” he added.\n\nBoris Epshteyn\n\nBoris Epshteyn is another longtime adviser and trusted member of Trump’s team. He was by the former president’s side throughout 2016 and his White House term, as well as his 2020 bid.\n\nIn particular, Epshteyn was significantly involved in working to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and challenging them in court.\n\nAppearing at Trump’s side during some of his court visits, he is understood to be one of very few that Trump speaks with frequently.\n\nSpeaking of the adviser previously, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called Epshteyn “a deeply valued member of the team,” adding that he’s “done a terrific job shepherding the legal efforts fighting” the Justice Department and various congressional investigations. \n\nSome, however, have suggested that Epshteyn has been a bad influence on the former president, urging him to move on some of his worse instincts.\n\nPast aides have complained about him on occasion for this. In 2022, it was reported that Trump lawyer Alan Garten wrote in an email, “Great job Boris. Another frivolous lawsuit. What a joke.” He was referencing a lawsuit filed in Florida against the New York attorney general, which Trump ultimately withdrew.",

        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "Does this kind of bumper-to-bumper street parking violate the social contract? You make the call!\n\nLook at the picture above. This is an unaltered image, taken today in DC by a Washingtonian staffer, of an extremely close bit of street parking.\n\nGut check: how does it make you feel? When is close … too close?\n\nLet’s start with a fact. The cars are not touching. There’s a least a millimeter—or two, even!—of daylight between them. Does that make everything okay? Or does seeing this irritate you anyway? Is it a reminder of every time some other driver tapped your bumper, gave you no room to operate, left you doing a half-dozen or more mini-cuts of your steering wheel, back and forth and back again, just to extract yourself from what was otherwise a perfectly fine parking space? Is parking this close downright rude? Just a wee bit sociopathic? An egregious, unacceptable violation of the social contract, the unwritten laws and social niceties that keep us from going full Lord of the Flies when cart and foot traffic bunches up at the front of the Wegmans in City Ridge? Is the driver of the car on the left worthy of scorn? Guilty AF? A serial offender? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to consider those preexisting bumper scratches.\n\nBut wait. Let’s add another fact. The cars are not boxed in by other cars. There are driveways on both sides: room on the left to drive out, and room on the right to back up. Does that mitigate matters? Change your mind? Upend your assumptions? Force you to reconsider, well, everything? Are you upset with yourself for being upset, without having a clear or full understanding of what you were seeing and reacting to? Is this image actually a metaphor for our post-truth information age hellscape, a chaotic infinite scroll where earnest idiots and bad faith actors alike are perpetually flooding the zone with shit—irresistible, attention-hijacking content nuggets that feel true and strike an emotional chord while intentionally or unwittingly leaving crucial context just outside the frame?\n\nOnly hold up. Maybe that’s wrong, too. Maybe parking this close is, in fact, bad, and the fault lies with the driver of the car on the right. Maybe said driver arrived after the car on the left was already parked, and even though pulling up so very, very close would prevent the driver of the left car from accessing their trunk, decided to roll right up to the line, anyway. That’s not illegal, of course. It’s also something that happens all the time on tight city streets. But maybe it shouldn’t! Maybe we should all be more considerate, go above and beyond the bare minimum of what we’ve learned to expect from each other. Maybe our social contact needs rewriting.\n\nOr not. Probably, we’re overthinking this. Like 2015’s meme dress or the dark side cave in The Empire Strikes Back, there might be nothing more to this parking photo than what you bring to it. So what’s your take?",

She was with co-stars Timothée Chalamat, Austin Butler, and Zendaya. The actor is the most recent famous person to have something thrown at her in public while she was at an event.\n\nFlorence Pugh Hit In Face At 'Dune: Part Two' Panel\n\nFlorence Pugh was shocked when something was thrown from the crowd and hit her in the face during a \"Dune: Part Two\" talk at Comic-Con in São Paolo, Brazil, on Sunday.\nThe event happened as Pugh, 27, stood near the edge of the stage with her co-stars, including Timothée Chalamat, Austin Butler, Zendaya, and others, to take pictures.\nIn social media videos, it's not clear what was thrown, but it hit her right eye in the middle of the face. She seems to say \"Oh, wow\" and reach for the thing on the ground in a clip.\nThe moment was caught on camera on social media, and the star was shocked. She touched her head before bending down to grab the thing. She looked at her co-stars after the event and they seemed to be surprised too.\n\nBefore what happened, she told him what she thought about working on the movie.\n\n\"I had an amazing time coming in and just hanging around with these people, let alone actually getting to work with them.\"\n\"Coming in here - the power in this room - is because of that first movie, and we felt that when we went on set every single day. So it feels really, really special being here with the second one.\"\n\nPugh didn't seem too hurt after the event, but that hasn't always been the case for people who have been onstage and been hit by something thrown by an audience member. In June, Bebe Rexha was hit in the face by a flying cellphone. She needed stitches to heal.\nA problem that keeps coming up is fans throwing things at artists on stage. Harry Styles, Pugh's co-star in \"Don't Worry, Darling,\" was also hit by a fan throwing something at him during a show in Austria. While walking across the stage, the musician was hit. He put his hands over his eyes and winced in pain.\nIn the summer of this year, Drake was also hit by something at a show in Chicago. While she was in Las Vegas, Cardi B hit back at a fan who threw her microphone back at her for water.\nWhile she was in Las Vegas, Adele spoke out against the trend of fans throwing things at artists.\n\n\"Have you noticed how people are like forgetting fucking show etiquette in America, they’re just throwing shit on stage Have you seen that? I fucking dare you. Dare you to throw something at me.\"\n\nTaylor Swift stopped one of her shows in Buenos Aires last month to tell her fans not to throw things. She said:\n\n\"It really freaks me out. Because communication means having gentle, healthy boundaries, it really freaks me out when stuff gets thrown on the stage, because if it’s on the stage then a dancer can trip on it. I love that you brought presents and that is so nice, but just can you please not throw them on the stage. I love you so much.\"\n\nFinal Words\nThey went after the stars first, then the musicians. Fans throwing things at performers on stage is becoming a more disturbing trend, and Florence Pugh is the latest target. The event happened on Sunday while the actress was at a Dune: Part Two Panel at a Comic-Con event in São Paulo, Brazil.\nPugh was taking pictures with co-stars Timothée Chalamet, Austin Butler, and Zendaya while they talked about the sci-fi movie. Suddenly, something flew at the stage and hit her in the face.",

        "articleBody": "You may get the cracked software by visiting these top 10 cracked software download sites. You will be sent to that website after you click. That site allows you to download the software of your choosing.\n\nList of top 10 cracked software download sitesare discussed in this article. If you want to learn more about the specifics, read the whole article and take notes.\nThere are a plethora of sites available that enable you to download cracked software for free, but not all of them are secure. In addition to being unlawful, such websites are vulnerable to well-known malware and viruses.\nRather than leading you down a dark lane of pirated websites, we've picked the best-cracked software download sites that are legal. Doesn't it seem impossible? However, there are some of the greatest free full version cracked software download websites on the internet.\n \nWhat Is Cracked Software?\n\nSoftware cracking (also known as \"breaking\" in the 1980s) is the modification of software to remove or disable features that the person cracking the software deems undesirable, such as copy protection features (such as protection against software manipulation, serial numbers, hardware keys, date checks, and disc checks) or software security features.\nCracked software refers to commercial computer programs or applications that have had their copy protection or licensing mechanisms illegally tampered with or removed. This unauthorized modification allows users to use the software without purchasing a legitimate license, effectively making it available for free.\nCracked software is considered illegal and unethical as it violates copyright laws, depriving software developers of their rightful revenue. Using cracked software can lead to security risks, legal consequences, and the absence of technical support and updates, making it an undesirable and risky choice.\n\nTop 10 Crack Software Websites\n\nGet Into PC\n\nYou may get cracked versions of popular software for free from one of the most popular download sites, GetintoPC. You may find a link to download just about every piece of software imaginable here.\nThe site's search box makes it easy to narrow down available applications, and it's organized into more than a hundred distinct sections. Both current and ancient software releases may be found on the site.\nHundreds of new apps and games are introduced to the site every single day. Despite its user-friendliness and clean design, the site sometimes slows down due to adverts. The website receives regular usage from a large user base, and any software obtained there poses no security risks.\n\nMalwareTips\n\nIt's a community of techies who share excellent gifts and promotions on a regular basis on this website. This website has compiled a list of the most recent paid software freebies from various sources. The download URLs provided are secure and do not include any virus attachments.\n\nGiveaway Radar\n\nIf you're seeking for free PC software in 2019, Giveaway Radar is the place to go. You can get software from a variety of sources, including secure download sites and diverse suppliers, all in one spot. They do not, however, cover anti-virus and VPN giveaways.\n\nFileHippo\n\nFileHippo is yet another site where you can get cracked copies of the latest shareware, freeware, and demo software for free and without risk.\nThis page offers free downloads of industry-standard software, including the latest versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, VLC Media Player 64-bit, Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, and Avast Free Antivirus.\nIn addition, you can be certain that the software you get has been thoroughly screened for the presence of viruses, spyware, and adware.\n\nShare Ware On Sale\n\nSharewareonsale, one of the largest free software distribution sites, provides a variety of paid products for free every day. Not only does the platform provide free full-version apps, but it also gives software discounts.\n\nTechTipLib\n\nTechTipLib is one of the top cracked software download sites with a complete version of the product available for free. However, you must have a social media account to take advantage of the promotion. The website not only offers free software downloads, but also has over 6,700 titles including Windows, Mac, iPhone, MS Office, Freeware, SEO, WordPress, Theme, eBooks, and much more. As a result, it is included in our top ten cracked software download sites.\n\nSoftonic\nYou may also get the software for free from Softonic's website. The software for Windows, Android, and Mac may be found here. There are other games for PC that you may download for free.\n\nPirate City\n\nPiratecity is a website that allows users to obtain cracked software for both Windows and Mac computers. The site also has activators for Microsoft Windows 10 and a variety of other operating systems.\n\nNinite\n\nNinite is a fantastic site for obtaining cracked software, but it shouldn't be used for that purpose. Instead, it's designed to let you quickly and easily acquire legal PC software and install it on your machine. You may download free versions of popular PC applications like Google Chrome, VLC Media Player, and iTunes from this site.\nIn addition, they include an installer that makes it easy to set up the software suite on your computer. Choosing a program to download and set up is the only real work involved in this procedure. The installer or updater may then be downloaded and launched.\nA major factor in this website's inclusion on this blacklist is how difficult it is to find malicious software on it. Ninite guarantees that every software is virus-free and secure to use.\n\nSoftpedia\n\nThe Softpedia cracked software download site is up next on our list. Softpedia contains more than one million separate software titles. The site has downloads for OS X, Linux, and Windows. The website also provides access to mobile software and games.\nA section of the site is dedicated to the distribution of paid software. It's like a dictionary, only it has all the programs you need. The search box facilitates the process of narrowing down the available applications.\nThe site has gained popularity due to the wealth of information it provides about various software programs and video games. It is one of the best cracked software download sites since you can legally download free PC games from the site and read reviews from previous downloaders, which will give you a decent sense of what you are going to download into your phone.\n\nAre Cracked Software Sites Safe?\n\nWhen you need new software for your computer, you have two alternatives: hunt for free solutions or pay for possibly expensive software. These charges may be avoided by downloading cracked or pirated software. This is software that has been pirated and unlawfully accessed via a stolen or produced unlock code.\nCracked and illicit software might pose a security risk in more ways than you would think. It has the potential to infect your computer with malware, which may steal data. You have to go to shady websites to get the cracked software. Finally, the software could not operate, and it might also result in legal issues. Additionally, you risk infecting other devices on your network.\n\nIf you want to download cracked software on your PC for free and to avoid buying costly software, you can visit the top 10 cracked software download sites mentioned in the article above.\n\n \nIs It Legal To Download Cracked Software?\n\nSoftware copyright law is broken when pirated software is used or distributed. Each incident may result in fines of up to $150,000 for businesses and individuals. In addition, they have committed a felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\nA person's company, employment, and livelihood are all at risk if they use pirated software, even if they do it inadvertently (most sites offering cracked software don't notify consumers they're breaching the law by using it).\n\nIf a visiting professor is accused of using pirated software, for instance, the university may decide that he or she has violated the conditions of the agreement that allowed them to teach there.\n\nHow Safe Are Cracked Software Websites?\n\nCracked applications come with a variety of issues and risks that users should be aware of:\n\n   Virus Infections -Some cracked applications intentionally contain viruses or malware designed to harm your computer. It's essential to remove these threats to prevent damage to your system.\n    \n  Password Hassles -Cracked applications are often packaged in zip files with password protection. While they may provide instructions for obtaining the password, it's a common occurrence to either not receive the correct password or be directed to purchase it.\n   \n  Wrong Files -Downloading a cracked file can be frustrating, especially when you've invested time waiting for it to complete. Some cracked files turn out to be incorrect or fraudulent, leading to disappointment.\n\nOver the years, as someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer, I've searched for cracked versions of various applications. \n\nHere are some insights into this experience:\n\n  Old Applications -If you're looking for older applications, such as the classic \"Plants vs. Zombies,\" you might be in luck. There are numerous websites and torrents offering cracked versions. Torrents are often a reliable source and tend to be free from viruses.\n\n  Newly Released Applications -When seeking a cracked version of a recently released game like \"NFS Rivals,\" it's a different story. The chances of finding it are slim, and the quest can be frustrating. I've spent months searching for such games, only to come across the issues mentioned earlier. In some cases, you might even find illegal physical copies being sold in places like Manila for a low price. However, beware that these versions may not meet your computer's requirements, leading to disappointment.\n\nIn the end, dealing with cracked applications often results in complications and can negatively impact your computer and social life. Therefore, it's essential to consider the risks and consequences before choosing this route.\n\nReasons To Avoid Cracked Software\n\nWhile the temptation to download cracked software for free access to premium features may be strong, it's important to consider the numerous hazards and negative consequences associated with such actions. Here are five compelling reasons against using cracked software:\n \nSecurity Risks\n\nCracked software often undergoes unauthorized modifications by unknown individuals or groups. These alterations can compromise your device's security and privacy by introducing harmful code, viruses, or malware into the software. Using cracked software can expose your system to cyberattacks and data breaches, as it is a common vector for spreading malware.\n\nLegal Consequences\n\nDownloading and using cracked software is illegal and constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights and copyright laws. Engaging in software piracy can result in severe legal repercussions, including fines and potential imprisonment. Supporting the software industry by investing in legitimate licenses is not only an ethical choice but also ensures the continued development and innovation of high-quality software.\n\nUnreliable Performance\n\nCracked software often removes license restrictions or activation requirements. However, these alterations can lead to inconsistent performance, frequent crashes, and compatibility issues with other software or operating systems. Using software illegally or without a license compromises its reliability and performance.\n\nLack Of Support And Updates\n\nLegitimate software benefits from regular updates by reputable developers, enhancing functionality, addressing bugs, and improving security. In contrast, cracked software lacks updates, leaving you with an outdated and potentially unstable version. Moreover, unlicensed software lacks formal support channels, making it impossible to seek technical assistance or customer support when encountering issues.\n\nEthical Concerns\n\nSoftware piracy undermines the effort, innovation, and financial investment made by software creators. It devalues their intellectual property and affects their ability to earn a livelihood from their work. Downloading cracked software supports a culture of piracy that harms the software industry and those who rely on it for their livelihood.\n\nDownloading cracked software may seem like an attractive option, but it comes with significant risks, both legally and in terms of your device's security and performance. Choosing legitimate software not only ensures a safer and more reliable experience but also supports the industry and the hardworking individuals behind it.\n\nFAQs - List Of Top 10 Cracked Software Download Sites\n\nWhat Are Free Software Download Sites With Crack?\n\nCracked software download sites are web platforms where unauthorized, often illegally modified versions of premium software are made available for free.\n\nIs It Safe To Download Cracked Software From These Sites?\n\nNo, it's not safe.

        "articleBody": "Nothing in my childhood prepared me for this year’s Christmas Eve. Back in the day — that is, waaay back in the day — Christmas Eve was all about singing Christmas carols, trimming the tree and looking forward to Santa Claus.\n\nI wrote in a decades-old column that there was one family in our West End-Foggy Bottom neighborhood that never put up Christmas decorations or had a tree.\n\nI didn’t know why. They lived in the back of their small grocery store at the corner of 23rd and L streets NW. All I knew was that the Colodnys were White people who never seemed to have the Christmas spirit.\n\nSometime later, I learned they were Jewish. Even if I had known back then, I’m not sure it would have meant anything, since my ethnic universe in the 1940s consisted of White and “Colored” people, neighborhood Chinese laundry workers, the accented Cisco Kid and his sidekick Pancho on radio, vanquished Japanese soldiers and Germans who were White, too, but because of World War II were in a class all to themselves. That was about it.\n\nThe only thing I knew about Jews came from Sunday school. I think they were called Israelites. Jesus was one. That was my childhood worldview.\n\nA baby lying in a manger in a town called Bethlehem was my vision. “O, Little Town of Bethlehem” was my song.\n\nAt Stevens Elementary School, where each day began with the recitation of Bible verses, and the Liberty Baptist Church’s Sunday school, the Christmas season heard us singing our little hearts out with: “Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.” I didn’t quite know what that meant or where Israel was. But we had the Christmas spirit and a place in mind called the Holy Land.\n\nNothing in my childhood, or in ensuing Christmases, prepared me for this year.\n\nChristmas celebrations in Bethlehem, the Palestinian town in which Jesus was born, have been canceled.\n\nThe festive lights and the Christmas tree in Manger Square will be missing. So, too, crowds of visitors from around the world.\n\nBethlehem is in the shadow of war. Church leaders and the small congregations in the West Bank, where Bethlehem is located, will meet and pray at midnight. But there will be no marching bands or fireworks.\n\nWar, in the bloodiest and most destructive means possible, has descended. But its shadow has fallen not just over the Gaza Strip, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIt’s a war that got started while Christians everywhere were preparing for Advent and the Incarnation.\n\nThe conflagration was touched off Oct. 7, when the Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas attacked Israel, indiscriminatingly shooting, launching rockets, burning homes and committing unspeakable atrocities that left more than 1,200 dead, thousands wounded and savaged, and more than 200 hostages spirited to Gaza.\n\nCelebrate Christmas with children living and dying under rubble? With people desperate for food and mercy?\n\nDare we now sing the carol “The Holy City”? “As the shadow of a cross arose upon a lonely hill. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Hark! How the angels sing, Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna to your King! … Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Lift up your gates and sing” with the apocalypse descending on Gaza? Can it be that Israel has actually dropped some 29,000 bombs on Gaza?\n\nCelebrate the arrival of the Prince of Peace?\n\nThe consequences of hate spread beyond the battlefield.\n\nSince Hamas’s attack, the Anti-Defamation League has registered the highest number of antisemitic incidents during any two-month period since it began tracking them in 1979.\n\nThe ADL is not referring to criticism of Israeli government policies. It cites the presence of antisemitic rhetoric, open expressions of support for terrorism against the state of Israel and refusal by some people to accept the notion that Jews have a historic or spiritual connection to the land of Israel and deserve a state of their own. So, too, by all that’s right and fair, Palestinians.\n\nBy that measure, there is an ugliness afoot in our country. As in the Holy Land.\n\nYou don’t have to be a Middle East expert to know that the 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, most of which is under full Israeli control, are treated like dirt by many of the Israeli settlers.\n\nThe White House knows it, Congress knows it, the international community knows it. And many Christians know it, too.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, during this season of “Peace on Earth and goodwill toward men,” let’s face another reality: Muslims, who are not all of one race, ethnicity, skin tone or language, also get short shrift or worse because they don’t believe Jesus is the sole pathway to God.\n\nWhich gets me back to the Colodny family and our Christmases.\n\nMy goodness. What must it have been like for them?\n\nOur public schools would have made their son, Irving, feel unwelcome and inferior because he wasn’t a Christian.\n\nOur Christmas carols and Easter songs would have told him we thought our religion was better than his. Racially segregated though we were, we weren’t Jews, and our Christianity put us among the majority.\n\nWhich meant diddly squat. I read somewhere that God’s eternal promise of Christmas is a closeness with humanity, forgiveness of sins and a radical, unconditional love for all. We ain’t there yet.\n\nDespite it all, this Christmas, that’s what I’m praying for.",

        "articleBody": "It’s festive!\n\nThis is the last Today’s Opinions newsletter of the year; we’ll be dark all next week. But first — one more bit of light.\n\nIn case you’ve lost track of time, (1) this morning’s flavor on the Bonne Maman jam Advent calendar was mandarin-passion fruit, and (2) we’re three days from Christmas.\n\nThat gives you time to binge at least nine more cheesy holiday movies. Maybe use Edith Pritchett’s chart of the commonest Christmas movie tropes as a bingo card. (It could technically double as a drinking game, but with all the rugged hometown exes roaming the screen these days, you’d end up under the tree.)\n\nLet me know if you see any queer kisses under the mistletoe. In 2019, I promised that the first gay Hallmark movie to eventually come along would be “flat, predictable drivel” — and that would be a great thing.\n\n“For a community with a long history of holidays on the out,” I wrote, “looking up at the screen and realizing you’re just as unremarkable, just as boring, as everybody else might be its own Christmas miracle.” Now, I don’t know whether 2022’s gay fantasia “The Holiday Sitter” was a miracle, but it was nice all the same.\n\nThis last weekend before Christmas also gives Santa time for the second check of his list. Cartoonist Ann Telnaes, however, is pretty sure of who is on the naughty — nay, toxic — one. (Click through to see the looooooong roster.)\n\nBut the unsurpassed figure of yuletide toxicity, this year as every year, is the gift giver in “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” One of the all-time Alexandra Petri treasures (from 2012!) lays bare his diabolical largesse via a series of increasingly frantic thank-you notes from the recipient of what ends up being a LOT of birds:\n\n> Dear True Love, thank you so much for the partridge! What a lovely thought.\n\n> Dear True Love, thank you for the four calling birds. You really took it to heart when I said that I liked birds. I only got you a sweater, so, please, don’t feel obligated to get me anything else. Certainly not more birds.\n\n> Oh God. When I said “No more birds,” I never thought that this would be your response. I don’t know where you got eight milkmaids. Do I want to know? I do not think so.\n\nA queen’s Christmas message\n\nAmid all the mirth, I hope you’ll also hold in your hearts the many people painfully scraping to the end of the year. Rania Al Abdullah, Queen of Jordan, takes readers into Gaza and the West Bank, where Palestinians — Christian, Muslim, no matter — are suffering mightily in Israel’s war.\n\nAllow the queen to describe the scenes of grief she has witnessed. She observes: “How perverse that the Holy Land” should be transformed into “something so profoundly unholy.”\n\nAs you gather with your friends and family over these next precious days, she would have you remember one thing: “No matter who you are or where you come from, your instinct to care for and protect those you love is one you must honor in yourself but also in strangers — even adversaries. Honoring it selectively diminishes our own humanity.”\n\nFrom the Today’s Opinions crew, thank you for following along this year. And to all a good night.",

        "authors": "Gina Scinta",
        "date": "2023-12-13",
        "articleBody": "Validating the integrity of IT supply chains is critical to cybersecurity and includes the supply chain feeding software development.\n\nValidating the integrity of IT products’ supply chain has been a critical part of cybersecurity for years. Historically, hardware bill of materials were scrutinized by federal agencies to ensure that their products contained components from trustworthy sources. In the wake of major data breaches caused by malicious code injected during the software development process, the same scrutiny is now being applied to software. Enter the advent of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)—a term that has been a frequent topic of conversation since the National Cyber Strategy was released.\n\nWhile an SBOM is an important part of the cybersecurity mix, it’s essentially a checkbox to mark – an important part of the vetting process, but not a fix in itself.\n\nAs more emphasis is placed on SBOMs, it’s essential that both agencies and vendors keep in mind that what we’re talking about here is essentially an ingredient list for software security. It’s not to be confused with the recipe.\n\nA SBOM crash course\n\nLet’s have a quick primer for those new to the SBOM game. As explained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a SBOM is a “key building block in software security and software supply chain risk management.” The idea first gained attention in 2018, as an initiative promoted through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. \n\nThe problem proponents of SBOMs hope to address is supply chain risk mitigation. To ensure that products sold to the federal government are not susceptible to security incursions, the government is turning to SBOMs as a proof point that software built into various solutions is trustworthy.\n\nCISA has committed to advancing the cause of SBOMs, the organization states, “by facilitating community engagement, development, and progress, with a focus on scaling and operationalization, as well as tools, new technologies, and new use cases.”\n\nFrom this starting point, the SBOM concept has been inextricably woven into the National Cybersecurity Strategy. The strategy specifically notes that software supply chain risk mitigation will include “the Software Bills of Material (SBOM) efforts, NIST’s Secure Software Development Framework, and related efforts to improve open-source software security.”\n\nThe strategy document goes on to say that “the Administration will encourage coordinated vulnerability disclosure across all technology types and sectors; promote the further development of SBOMs; and develop a process for identifying and mitigating the risk presented by unsupported software that is widely used or supports critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (EO14028) puts the onus on the Ssecretary of Commerce and NIST to provide guidance on practices to improve software supply chain security. This guidance, according to the EO, will include “providing a purchaser a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each product directly or by publishing it on a public website.”\n\nSecure by design\n\nThis emphasis on SBOMs is part of the government-wide demand that cybersecurity be baked into products sold to the government – to shift the responsibility for cybersecurity away from agencies and put it in the hands of vendors and integrators.\n\nBut a SBOM is only a necessary part of the process to mitigate software risk. As CISA notes, SBOMs are “a key building block in software security,” and “a list of ingredients that make up software components.” There are no specifics regarding what makes for a good SBOM. It’s not synonymous with supply chain security. As a “list of ingredients,” to use CISA’s language, what’s missing is the recipe – the process by which those ingredients are incorporated into a product or solution.\n\nIt's up to vendors to do their absolute best to provide confidence in an SBOM. The federal government has to do more to guide the vendor community to appropriate tools, so that it is not such a time-consuming manual process. Down the road, it would be ideal, for example, to be able to reference a list of open-source or third party products through the National Vulnerability Database. From there it would be possible to assess whether there are vulnerabilities in the solutions integrated into products, and to validate the SBOM itself.\n\nIf products and solutions are to be “secure by design,” as it were, there must be more comprehensive requirements from the government to provide compliance milestones.\n\nThis notion of “secure by design” is also an initiative spearheaded by CISA, through a draft document that seeks to shift the balance of cybersecurity risk from the customer to the vendor. Many in the industry are evaluating that document to glean guidance as to what that means in practical terms.\n\nDevOps demands DevSecOps\n\nAll of this is important for the federal market because in many cases not only are vendors developing software and products, but so are their agency customers. The idea of incorporating security in the development process is still a somewhat novel concept. After all, in the early days of application development, before the Internet, no one had to worry about security. All systems were run in a closed environment. Now, you can’t have a conversation about DevOps without including DevSecOps.\n\nIt has become incumbent on both vendors and agencies alike to be aware of security vulnerabilities as they are developing solutions. For some organizations it might mean integrating a hardware security module (HSM) into your DevOps. That would allow for secrets management or code signing security to be brought into the DevOps process –leveraging a HSM root of trust to create a higher level of security around the development process. Security needs to be a forethought, not an afterthought.\n\nAll of this is to say that a SBOM is a necessary part of cybersecurity strategy, but it is not nearly sufficient for cybersecurity. As the responsibility for cybersecurity shifts from clients to vendors, the ingredient list is essential, and it requires further guidance from the government to ensure compliance from the vendor community. But the ingredient list for cybersecurity must not be confused with the recipe itself.",

        "authors": "Peter J. Pitts",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "Biden administration marches in over our access to drugs.\n\nThe Biden administration just announced a sweeping policy wish list that’s supposed to function as an early Christmas gift to America’s health care consumers. But it’s really more like a lump of coal.\n\nThe proposed new framework would allow faceless Beltway bureaucrats to arbitrarily revoke patent licensing agreements on medicines that benefited even slightly from federally funded early-stage academic research. Uncle Sam, M.D., wants the authority to then relicense those patents to generic drug companies that would produce cheaper copies. Well, maybe.\n\nIn reality, this new Washington power grab — if established after a two-month review and comment period — would actively deter innovative private developers from licensing those patents in the first place. Instead of getting cheaper drugs, American patients would get far fewer new medicines at all. Definitely.\n\nThis ill-considered new policy hinges on a minor provision of a 1980 law known as the Bayh-Dole Act. The law grants universities, research institutions and similar entities the ability to retain the patents on their discoveries, even if their labs had received grants from the National Institutes of Health or other federal agency. (Prior to Bayh-Dole, the government retained title to all patents arising from federally funded research.)\n\nBefore Bayh-Dole, potentially life-changing inventions and discoveries gathered dust in academic filing cabinets because of the considerable real-world cost and risk of turning good ideas into real-world products. Even if inventors, their universities and the sponsoring government agencies had identified companies qualified to commercialize those patents, private companies generally weren’t interested — since the government could have revoked the licenses on a whim.\n\nBut Bayh-Dole worked. Since the law’s passage, thousands of products arising from publicly funded research have come to market. These inventions include over 200 lifesaving drugs, vaccines and diagnostics. The Bayh-Dole Act even facilitated the development and commercialization of the breakthrough mRNA platform behind COVID-19 vaccines — for which two scientists recently won a Nobel Prize.\n\nBayh-Dole’s architects rightly believed that taxpayer-funded research should benefit the public as much as possible. So they added a provision to the law stipulating that companies that license those patents must make a legitimate effort to develop them into tangible products.\n\nIf a company just sits on the patent, the government reserves the right to “march in” and relicense the patent to a company that will commercialize it.\n\nIf it ain’t broke, don’t fix it? Not in Washington. Now the Biden administration wants to reinterpret this march-in provision, allowing nameless, faceless bureaucrats to relicense patents for inventions that have already been successfully commercialized. The new framework would allow the government to simply direct generic drugmakers to start producing cheap copies of any brand-name drug that came to market if it benefited in any way from federal research funding.\n\nIt’s a flagrant distortion of the plain meaning of the law. The legislation’s sponsors — Sens. Birch Bayh, Indiana Democrat, and Bob Dole, Kansas Republican — stated in 2002 that “Bayh-Dole did not intend that government set prices on resulting products” and that “the ability of the government to revoke a license granted under the act is not contingent on the pricing of a resulting product.”\n\nMisusing Bayh-Dole’s march-in clauses as a de facto price control would obliterate private firms’ willingness to license and commercialize discoveries from universities and other federally funded research institutions. All taxpayer-funded research, no matter how promising, could become tainted overnight.\n\nThis isn’t a theoretical concern. A few decades ago, the National Institutes of Health added a “reasonable pricing” clause to cooperative research agreements struck between the NIH and private companies. The result? The number of public-private partnerships plunged, and the agency was forced to revoke the clause just a few years after it took effect.",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "The US abstains on resolution that it lobbied to weaken over the course of several days, allowing it to pass.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza, following several delays over the last week as the United States lobbied to weaken the language regarding calls for a ceasefire.\n\nThe resolution, which calls for steps “to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities”, passed on Friday with 13 votes in favour, none against, and the US and Russia abstaining.\n\nThe vote came amid international calls to bring the months-long conflict to an end, as Israeli forces pummel Gaza with one of the most destructive campaigns in modern history and humanitarian conditions in the besieged strip reach critical levels.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced, and conditions under Israeli siege and bombardment have been described by UN officials as “hell on earth”.\n\nIntense negotiations took place over the last week, with other member states searching for language that would avoid US objections that have doomed previous resolutions on Gaza in the 15-member body, where the US is one of five countries that hold a veto.\n\nThe original draft called for “an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities” and gave the UN increased control over aid deliveries into Gaza. The adopted resolution opts for less equivocal language on a ceasefire and maintains Israel’s control over all aid.\n\n“This was tough, but we got there,” US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said following the vote.\n\nWhile a trickle of aid trucks have delivered much-needed assistance to Gaza, aid groups say that truly addressing the strip’s humanitarian crisis will not be possible as long as hostilities continue.\n\n“The real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza. An effective aid operation in Gaza requires security, staff who can work in safety, logistical capacity, and the resumption of commercial activity. These four elements do not exist,” UN chief Antonio Guterres told reporters following the vote.\n\nBefore the vote, Russia proposed an amendment strengthening the language around a ceasefire, saying that the draft resolution had been “neutered” by the US.\n\n“By signing off on this, the council would essentially be giving the Israeli armed forces complete freedom of movement for further clearing of the Gaza Strip,” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote.\n\nThomas-Greenfield accused her Russian counterpart of hypocrisy, pointing to Russia’s own destructive invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022.\n\nBut the US has faced accusations of a double-standard over its position on Gaza, with critics saying that the US has spent months railing against Russia for violations of international law in Ukraine while providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support, even as it faces similar accusations over its conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe US vetoed a UNSC resolution calling for a ceasefire earlier this month, and was one of the few dissenting votes when the UN General Assembly passed a ceasefire resolution by an overwhelming margin last week.\n\n“The vast majority of Security Council members, and members of the General Assembly, all want a ceasefire, a complete halting of the bombardment of Gaza, in order to facilitate aid,” Al Jazeera correspondent Gabriel Elizondo reported from UN headquarters.\n\nEarlier this week, the UN called for an investigation into allegations of the killing of unarmed Palestinians by Israeli troops in the strip, and hospitals, UN schools, medical workers, mosques, and churches have also been targeted.\n\nIsrael has said that it is working to dismantle Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza and launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 captive.\n\nMore than 20,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed since the current round of fighting began.",

        "articleBody": "The latest death toll stands at 28,228 Palestinians and about 1,139 people killed in Israel since October 7.\n\nIsrael has continued its attacks across the Gaza Strip, including near hospitals and in the south of the besieged enclave, where ground operations are intensifying.\n\nHere are the latest casualty figures as of February 8 at 2:30pm in Gaza (12:30 GMT):\n\nGaza\n  \n    -Killed: at least 27,840 people, including more than:\n        -12,150 children\n       - 8,300 women\n    -Injured: more than 67,317, including at least:\n       - 8,663 children\n        -6,327 women\n    -Missing: more than 7,000\n\nThe latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the occupied West Bank are as follows:\n \nOccupied West Bank\n  \n\n    -Killed: at least 388 people, including more than:\n    -102 children\n    -Injured: more than 4,450\n\nIn Israel, officials revised the death toll down from 1,405 to 1,139.\n\nIsrael\n  \n    -Killed: about 1,139 people\n    -Injured: at least 8,730\n\nDevastation across Gaza\n\nAccording to the latest data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Palestinian government as of February 6, Israeli attacks have damaged:\n\n    -More than half of Gaza’s homes - 360,000 residential units have been destroyed or damaged\n    -390 educational facilities\n    -13 out of 35 hospitals are partially functioning\n    -122 ambulances\n     -267 places of worship\n \nNowhere safe to go\n\nThe Israeli army published an online map of the Gaza Strip on December 1, dividing the enclave into more than 600 numbered blocks. It asked Gaza’s civilians to identify the block corresponding with their area of residence and evacuate when ordered.\n\nHowever, leaflets ordering evacuations are inconsistent with online warnings, which has confused residents.\n\nFurthermore, several Gaza residents have no reliable way to access the map with little access to electricity or the internet since the blockade of the 365sq-km (141sq-mile) strip has resulted in a collapse of telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nEvery hour in Gaza:\n\n    -15 people are killed - six are children\n    -35 people are injured\n    -42 bombs are dropped*\n    -12 buildings are destroyed\n\nBased on the first six days of the war, according to the Israeli army\n\nJournalists killed\n\nAs of January 18, at least 94 journalists, mostly Palestinians, have been killed since the Israel-Gaza war began on October 7. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), 87 Palestinian, three Lebanese and four Israeli journalists have been killed.\n\nSixteen years of Israeli blockade\n\nThe Gaza Strip has a population of about 2.3 million people living in one of the most densely populated areas in the world and is located between Israel and Egypt on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nSince 2007, Israel has maintained strict control over Gaza's airspace and territorial waters and restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza.\n\nAfter Hamas's October 7 attacks in southern Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to turn Gaza into a “deserted island” and warned its residents to “leave now”.\n\nHow the Hamas attack unfolded\n\nOn the morning of October 7 about 6:30am (03:30 GMT), Hamas fired a huge barrage of rockets into southern Israel with sirens heard as far away as Tel Aviv and Beersheba.\n\nThe group said it launched 5,000 rockets in the initial barrage. Israel’s military said 2,500 rockets were fired.\n\nAbout an hour later, fighters crossed into Israel in an unprecedented multipronged operation through land, air and sea. Most fighters entered through breaches in security barriers separating Gaza and Israel.\n\nHamas’s surprise attack came after Israeli settlers had stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and after a record number of Palestinians had been killed by Israel at that point in 2023.\n\nAt 9:45am (06:45 GMT), blasts were heard in Gaza and at 10am (07:00 GMT), Israel’s military spokesperson said the air force was carrying out attacks in Gaza.\n\nGun battles continued between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters in several areas of southern Israel.\n\nIsraeli air attacks continued late into the night as did rocket fire into southern Israel.\n\nGaza's densely populated neighbourhoods\n\nThe Gaza Strip comprises five governorates: North Gaza, Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah.\n\nNorth Gaza extends for 10km (six miles) and shares the only crossing into Israel through Beit Hanoon, also known as the Erez crossing.\n\nNorth Gaza is home to the Jabalia refugee camp, the largest in the Gaza Strip.\n\nGaza City is the largest and most populous city with more than 750,000 residents. Remal, Shujayea and Tal al-Hawa are among its most well-known neighbourhoods.\n\nAt the heart of the Remal neighbourhood is al-Shifa Hospital – the largest medical facility in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDeir el-Balah is one of Gaza’s largest agricultural producers. It is also home to four refugee camps: Nuseirat, Bureij, Maghazi and Deir el-Balah.\n\nGaza’s only operating power plant is located along the district’s boundary with Gaza City.\n\nKhan Younis is home to about 430,000 people. At its centre is the Khan Younis refugee camp, where about 90,000 people live.\n\nRafah is the southernmost district of Gaza with a population of about 275,000. Rafah is also the name of the crossing with Egypt that is located here.\n\nBoth Israel and Egypt have kept their borders largely shut and are responsible for further deteriorating the already weakened economic and humanitarian situation.",

        "articleBody": "Lip glosses have come and gone from the slip pocket inside my purse. It’s precious, easy-to-access real estate — holding the beauty products I never leave the house without. (That, and the occasional neatly folded receipt.) That’s where I permanently keep my Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Ice Cooling Lip Luminizer.\n\nI first tried out this iteration of the brand’s Gloss Bomb during Best of Beauty testing. I had reached for it for two reasons: First, it was a hexagonal tube of blue goo in a sea of reds and pinks. Second, it was emblazoned with the word “Ice” in holographic letters across it.\n\nIt comes in just one shade — Cold Heart’d — and is one of the brand’s best sellers. Fenty Beauty claims it “instantly makes lips look fuller.” Cosmetic chemist Ginger King says that does not do anything to lips to make them physically bigger, but it instead contains styrene copolymers to coat them, making them feel and appear ever-so-slightly fuller. (King adds that traditional lip plumpers use capsicum or vanillyl butyl ether to increase blood flow. That’s what causes the spicy — and sometimes painful — feeling when you apply them.)\n\nTo use it, I pull its chubby doe foot applicator out of its tube and simply sweep it on. It slides across my lips feeling thick and balmy (but not sticky or tacky) as I smack and rub them together. It has a cooling sensation (caused by peppermint oil and menthol) and highlights the curves of my lips, making them appear extra-luscious (and extra-sexy) with a mirror-like shine.\n\nAs an added bonus, this product \"uses shea butter this helps to nourish the lips,\" says Marisa Garshick, MD, board-certified dermatologist. She adds that the gloss also “helps protect against dry, cracked or chapped lips.” It works hard and I’ll be keeping it extra close during the winter.\n\nI take it with me everywhere and this sentiment is shared across the Allure team. The Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Ice Cooling Lip Luminizer just won a Best of Beauty Award. It’s $26 for 0.3 oz., and available for purchase on the brand’s website, Sephora.com, and Ulta.com.",

        "articleBody": "Almost everything is fair game and up to 30% off in this Glossier blowout sale.\n\nBabe, wake up — Glossier's Cyber Monday 2023 sales are here. Why are we so excited? Easy. The iconic brand is famously not on sale, so when their annual, unbeatable Cyber Monday savings event pops up, we're basically beside ourselves. Of course, we wouldn't complain if Glossier spoiled us more often, but we'd never hold their selectiveness against them. Partially because their Cyber Monday beauty deals are always so darn good.\n\nUntil November 27 at 11:59 PM EST, almost everything on glossier.com is 25% off (although exclusions apply), and if your order is $100 or more, you get 30% off. It's Glossier's most impressive Cyber Monday sale yet, so get in on all the goodness before it's too late.\n \nOur Top Picks:\n\n    Best Makeup Deal: Glossier Lidstar $18 $14\n    Best Skin-Care Deal: Glossier Cleanser Concentrate $21 $16\n    Best Body-Care Deal: Glossier Body Hero Exfoliating Bar $15 $11\n    Best Set Deal: Glossier Fresh-Faced Set $57 $48\n    Best Limited Edition Set: Glossier Party Pots Kit $40\n    Best Scent Deal: Glossier You $68 $51\n\nIn addition to the (basically) sitewide sale, Glossier is offering four limited edition holiday sets complete with delightfully pink packaging, good enough to hand over as a prezzie sans wrapping paper. They're not included in the Cyber Monday sales parameters, but don't let that stop you. It's sure not stopping us. The same goes for all of their to-die-for merch.\n\nUnless you feel like snagging your favorite hues of editor-beloved products like Cloud Paint at full price, this is your moment to restock your Glossi-essentials. So warm up your leftovers, get out those scrolling fingers, and assemble your brand-new glam game plan.\n\nWATCH\n\nUnboxing | June 2019 | Moroccanoil, BrowGal, and More\n\nWhether you're getting some Christmas shopping done early or buying for yourself, now is the time to strike. Here are the 33 best Glossier Cyber Monday sales we're snatching up before the clock chimes midnight.\n\nBest Cyber Monday Glossier Skin-Care Deals\n\nWash a day's worth of makeup away without over-stripping your skin's moisture with the help of Glossier's Milky Jelly Cleanser. This gel-based face wash gently removes makeup (even waterproof), excess oil, and dead skin cells while allantoin and pro-vitamin B5 condition and soothe skin.\n\nDry, chapped lips have nothing on Glossier's ever-popular Balm Dotcom. This beloved lip treatment contains castor oil, lanolin, and beeswax to condition lips for a suppler, softer feel. You can grab the untinted Original formula to apply its nourishing formula wherever you need it most, but any of its nine shades leave a subtle, dewy tint behind to act as your go-to lip gloss.\n\net a more intense cleanse with just a few pumps of Glossier's Cleanser Concentrate. Its pore-unclogging formula is infused with mild chemical exfoliators, including lactic and malic acids, to remove flaky patches, excess oil, and dead skin. At the same time, niacinamide brightens your complexion and balances sebum.\n\nOn days when your skin is feeling especially dry or irritated, whip out the After Baume. A moisture-retaining blend of babassu oil, cupuaçu butter, and green microalgae extract powers this rich, buttery formula. Its gentle formula has a Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association, so people with sensitive skin can feel confident using it without risking any irritating side effects.\n\nBest Cyber Monday Glossier Body-Care Deals\n\nWhile this Glossier Deodorant is worth it at full price, we never mind saving a few bucks on a product as good as this one. The aluminum-free formula has a coconut oil base and infusions of Superfruit Elderberry extract, Magnesium Hydroxide, and potato starch to keep your pits moisturized and dry. It's avail in three lovely scents — Sandstone, Glossier You, and Orange Blossom Neroli — and a scent-free option for when you want your fragrance to do the talking.\n\nSpeaking of…in need of a new fragrance? You have to try Glossier's You Eau de Parfum. It's the brand's only scent and smells warm and creamy, thanks to the musk, ambrette, and ambrox notes — making it perfect for the holidays.\n\nince it's getting colder outside, you may be experiencing dry skin. Meet your solution: The Body Hero Exfoliating Bar. No matter your moisturizing preference, the Milky Jelly Cleansing Bar will make you and your skin happy, so add it to your cart as you shop the Glossier Cyber Monday sale. This gentle conditioning formula can be used all over. Basically, it's the aforementioned Milky Jelly Cleanser in bar form. Can't go wrong.\n\nBest Cyber Monday Glossier Makeup Deals\n\nGlossier's Monochromes mini eye shadow palette is, of course, also on sale. Each of the ten shade range options contains a trio of matte, satin, and metallic shades that blend seamlessly. You can stick to the three shades in your compact, or you can grab different refill packs (which are a few bucks cheaper than buying the compact sets) to mix and match them.\n\n   \nFor those of you who would rather rock a metallic eye look, that's where the eight crystal-hued colors that Glossier's Lidstar — a liquid holographic shadow — come in. Each shade has a shimmering finish and a buttery feel that's easy to blend with other shadows. It also has a buildable formula, so you can create a subtle veil of glistening color or layer them for more intensity.\n\nWhether your look is minimal or more dramatic, you'll always want to set your makeup as a final touch to avoid fading, smudging, and mid-day oiliness. To set your makeup, whip out Glossier's Wowder, a finely milled finishing and setting powder that absorbs excess oil without totally mattifying your skin, creating a dewy (not greasy) finish.\n\nIf you want to add more to your cart, check out Haloscope, the brand's holographic highlighting stick. It comes in three crystal-inspired shades to choose from and has a buildable finish that can be as subtle or intense as you please.\n\nIf you need new lipstick, allow us to introduce you to Generation G, one of the champion cosmetics products from Glossier. It comes in six sheer pigments that leave behind a wash of matte color for a subtle and simple finish that'll go with any of your daily looks.\n\nFans of Generation G, meet its hydrating sister, Ultraslip. This dewier successor to the brand's beloved lipstick has a balmier texture that glides on like butter. It comes in nine sheer, buildable shades to choose from, too.\n\nMore Glossier Cyber Monday Picks\n\nWhether your purse needs a tiny, new best friend or if you're already panicking about what to stuff stockings with, Glossier minis are here to save the day. The Mini Milky Jelly Cleanser is what it sounds like, and at $4, we can't believe it's real. The Mini Universal Pro-Retinol is a perfect way to test your retinol tolerance without rolling the dice with a full-price, full-size tube.\n\nGot even more milk? Glossier does. The brand's Milky Oil stands out among other gentle makeup removers for its Pro-Vitamin B5 conditioning formula that softens skin while swiftly erasing a long day's worth of gunk. Once your face is clean, go in with Glossier Super Pure, a lightweight Niacinamide serum that yields more balanced-looking skin in just four weeks.\n\nGlossier's Solar Paint is the handy little cream highlighter you didn't know you were missing. A quick swipe of the stuff adds warmth and radiance to your skin with a natural-looking, lightweight formula. The Mega Greens Galaxy Pack is a deep-cleaning, detoxifying mask that uses white kaolin clay and vitamin-rich leafy greens to rejuvenate skin gently. Top it all off with Glossier Lip Gloss, a go-to, straightforward, reliable AF gloss that imparts glassy shine with no stickiness.\n\nBest Glossier Limited Edition Sets\n\nGlossier popped off with these limited-edition sets. The packaging is to die for, and the product combos hit the spot. The sets aren't on sale for Black Friday, but they've earned a spot on our list because their mere existence is a special occasion.\n\nStart with the Party Pots Kit, which features three pots of buildable eye, lip, and cheek shimmer in hues Buzz, Click, and Twist. Then, go ahead and add the Pencils Up Kit to your cart. The limited-edition shimmer No. 1 Pencil shades married with the black Lash Slick is your one-way ticket to eye-popping gorgeousness.\n\nThe Cranberry Lip Trio is holiday-ready, complete with three lip products: G Suit, a demi-matte lip crème, the Ultralip balmy lipstick, and Generation G, a sheer matte lipstick. They all come in the Cranberry shade, a berry red crimson for the warm, wintery pout of your dreams. Cream and Balm Dot Com.\n\nBest Glossier Set Deals\n\nWhile the 25%-30% Black Friday discount doesn't apply to sets, they're on sale anyway, and we believe in sale equality. We want you to prosper, so we're tossing them in, Black Friday or no Black Friday. Now, without further ado.\n\nAre you ready to switch up your eye makeup routine? Then grab No. 1 Pencil Trio Set, a bundle of three eyeliners that each come in 10 versatile hues to customize your dream color scheme. Try out a combo of reddish-orange Kiln, the eggplant Roccoco, and the warm yellow shade Ochre to copy and paste those turning fall leaves right onto your eyelids.\n\nThe crowning touch to your makeup routine is The Makeup Set. This three-piece kit includes Glossier's Cloud Paint liquid blush, Boy Brow tinted eyebrow gel, and the Lash Slick tubing mascara.\n\nWe've all been summoned to an impromptu Zoom meeting, with sleep crust still in the corners of our eyes, suddenly scrambling to put on something, anything, in two minutes. While we think you look gorgeous, crust and all, this Fresh-Faced Set by Glossier will spare you some mayhem. It comes with a tube of fan-favorite Boy Brow, Balm Dotcom, and a bottle of Futuredew. Of course, you can pick your brow and balm colors, and the oil/serum hybrid adds gleam to whatever's underneath.\n\nIf your shower's been yearning for a little more luxury, now is the time to strike. In the Body Hero Duo Set, you'll get a full-size Body Hero Daily Perfecting Cream and Body Hero Daily Oil Wash. Start by applying the facial oil wash under the cascading water, and after you step out, rub the perfecting cream wherever your body needs hydration.\n\nWhile you're in the skin-care section, be sure to check out The Super Pack, a set of three serums that each have their own benefits, such as hydrating, calming, and smoothing your complexion. There's also the Dewy Look Set, which features the ever-natural-looking combo of Cloud Paint and Futuredew.\n\nBoy Brow reappears, this time with its mate, Brow Flick. By combining the pomade with the fine lines of the felt tip pen, you'll have the classic Glossier brow look within seconds. Boy Brow fluffs and tints, while the pen fills in the blanks with hair-like strokes. The set is unstoppable and on sale.\n\nCloud Paint is a Glossier set staple, but if you're a true fan, why not get two? The liquid blush gives the ultimate, natural-looking rosiness and only requires a teeny drop. It comes in a ton of versatile shades, so grab your tried and true shade as well as a new hue like Soar, which just hit shelves.\n\nGlossier's Perfecting Skin Tint + Stretch Balm Concealer Duo is a can't-go-wrong couple of necessities. As we touched on earlier, the Stretch Balm Concealer is long-wearing and buildable and pairs perfectly with the Skin Tint's silky sheer formula.\n\nBest Glossier Merch\n\nOk, ok, fine. Glossier merch isn't on sale, but it's some of the best beauty swag around. If you're feeling inspired by your day's savings and want to rep the brand behind your new haul (in a highly chic way) grab one of these merch items either for you or as a gift to another Glossier girlie.\n\nSocks are one of the holiday season's most universal (and, honestly, controversial) gifts. Maybe you've stifled an eye roll in years past upon receiving another pair of socks for Xmas, but these Glossier Socks are different, we swear. The flamingo/clay colorway is effortlessly chic, and the tiny \"G\" patch on the top is too cute. They're just perfect, okay?\n\nIf socks aren't your speed, go for the Glossier You Look Good Tote. The stripes are reminiscent of a candy cane, perfect for winter, but the vibrant pink and red make for an easy segue to spring and summer. Whether you bring it to the farmer's market or your local Glossier store to load up on the products of your dreams, this tote is your newest mainstay.\n\nYou can't go wrong with the Original Pink Hoodie, a loose-fit pullover sweatshirt that comes in the brand's signature millennial pink and ranges in sizes extra-small to 3X-large.\n\nKeep your new makeup and skin-care goodies in place with Glossier's The Beauty Bag. This slim pouch carries all of your beauty essentials in true Glossier fashion and has a removable red organizing slip with four pockets to stow away your must-haves.\n\nWho wouldn't want to rock this Glossier Duffle Bag at the airport? This zippered bag is large enough for your weekend getaway bag and comes in this gorgeous desert rose shade. Also, if you're more of a crewneck than a hoodie person, this second Glossier sweatshirt is giving.\n\nStay hydrated in style with the Glossier Water Bottle, which comes in a lemony green and carries 32 ounces of water. It's decorated with the brand's \"you look good,\" just in case you forgot.\n\nIf nothing here piques your interest, check out all of the other Glossier products up to 30% off at glossier.com. We're certain you'll find a product that catches your eye or something you can gift out this holiday season.",

Earning the title of Miss Vtuber, Vtuber of the Year, and having been responsible for hosting the Best Streamed Event in the form of her Subathon, she has solidified her position as one of the most prominent virtual characters in online streaming.\n\nIt was hard not to feel VShojo's presence at the awards through nominations alone. There was Ironmouse, of course, but Zentreya, a personal favorite of mine for her style and unique chat interactions, was nominated for three separate awards. Projekt Melody was nominated for two and ended up winning Lewdtuber of The Year, accepting the award with a wonderful speech about the award representing how far the community has come in breaking down social barriers. Even newcomers to VShojo like Matara Kan and Henya The Genius were nominated for awards, with the latter winning Rising Star Vtuber.\n\nWhile Hololive lost to Ironmouse for the Best Streamed Event of the Year, they did come out on top as the best Vtuber organization. They also had a few of their talent win specific awards, like Gawr Gura winning Most Dedicated Fanbase and Mori Calliope winning Best Music Vtuber. Then there was Selen Tatsuki, who came in and claimed two awards for NIJISANJI EN as the Best FPS Vtuber and Gamer of the Year!\n\nGiven the sheer number of submitted applicants and the specifics of some award categories, it wasn't common to find Vtubers being nominated for multiple awards, and a solid indie presence was felt from beginning to end. Sinder, who, on top of helping out with the opening ceremony, was nominated for two awards along with Shylily. Shylily won Best Chatting Vtuber and presented Ironmouse with her Miss Vtuber award. Despite winning, some Vtubers weren't present to give a speech, which makes sense when considering that Vtubing has become a global industry spanning multiple time zones.\n\nThe full list of winners is below:\n\n    Best FPS Vtuber - SELEN TATSUKI\n    Best Tech Vtuber - VEDAL987\n    Best Art Vtuber (Presented by Nihmune) - NINOMAE INA'NIS\n    Best Music Vtuber - MORI CALLIOPE\n    Vtuber Clipper - COOKSIE\n    Vtuber Parent of The Year - 2WINTAILS\n    Funniest Vtuber - CHIBIDOKI\n    Most Chaotic Vtuber (Presented by Punkalopi) - KOBO KANAERU\n    Most Dedicated Fanbase (Presented by Porcelainmaid) - CHUMBUDS (GAWR GURA)\n    Best Minecraft Vtuber - KAELA KOVALSKIA\n    Best Roleplay/ASMR Vtuber - CERES FAUNA\n    Lewdtuber of The Year - PROJEKT MELODY\n    Miss Vtuber (Presented by Shylilly) - IRONMOUSE\n    Best Chatting/ Zatsu Vtuber - SHYLILY\n    Stream Game of The Year - SUIKA GAME\n    Best Concert of The Year (Presented by Bao) - CONNECT THE WORLD\n    Best Philanthropic Event - MIKA MELATIKA'S 60-HOUR CHARITY MARATHON\n    Best Streamed Event - IRONMOUSE SUBATHON\n    Hidden Gem - FUFU\n    Rising Star (Presented by FEFE) - HENYA THE GENIUS\n    Rising Vtuber Organization- PHASE CONNECT\n    Gamer of The Year - SELEN TATSUKI\n    League of Their Own (Presented by MERRYWEATHER) - FUWAMOCO\n    Best Vtuber Organization - HOLOLIVE\n    Vtuber of The Year - IRONMOUSE",

Feat Pictures did not announce the opening date for the film.\n\nThe film opened in Japan on December 8. The film ranked at #6 in its opening weekend in Japan.

        "articleBody": "The move could also hurt American automakers like Ford and General Motors.\n\nAs Chinese automakers gain ground in Europe and Latin America, the Biden administration is considering raising taxes on cars and EV batteries coming to America from China, according to the Wall Street Journal. Citing unnamed sources, the Journal reports this move is to bolster the clean energy industry in the U.S. against cheaper Chinese exports, but it could hurt some American car companies as well.\n\nCars made in China and sold in the U.S. already face a stiff 27.5 percent tax, and it's hurting companies worldwide—including American players like Ford and General Motors. The 2024 Lincoln Nautilus will be exclusively made in China, while General Motors imports the Buick Envision from its joint-venture plant with SAIC Motors. Volvo is about to launch the all-electric EX30 in the U.S., which has a starting price of $36,000 and is built in China, while Polestar imports the Polestar 2 sedan from the region as well.\n\nIf the Biden or future administrations move forward with the tariff hike, it will have big implications around the automotive world. Americans would likely end up with more expensive electric vehicles, and batteries coming from China would have artificially-hiked costs. Already, the new Lincoln Nautilus SUV, which doesn't have an EV variant, will start $5,000 higher than the outgoing model, before any other material, tax, or otherwise expected model-to-model price increases.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has set some protectionist measures against Chinese-derived components for EVs. The recent Inflation Reduction Act gives certain U.S. car buyers a $7,500 incentive to purchase an electric vehicle, but cars made outside of North America, or cars which battery's components or minerals don't come from North America, don't qualify for the incentive, unless those countries have a free-trade agreement with the U.S. For 2024, those rules get tougher, with cars like the base Tesla Model 3 or Ford Mustang Mach-E not getting the incentive anymore, at least at the start of 2024, with automakers scrambling to find suitable parts and resources. (The Mach-E only qualified for a $3,750 incentive). These rules only apply to those buying an EV; leased vehicles still qualify for the tax credit, so expect to see a lot more EV leases next year.\n\nEarlier this year, MotorTrend reported that 11 Chinese automakers entered the Mexican market in the last three years and have quickly gained almost 10 percent of market share in that country—up from zero just four years ago. \"The Chinese are using Mexico as the segue to enter the U.S. market,\" automotive analyst César Roy told us in an interview. That worried a group of bipartisan lawmakers, who sent a letter to U.S. Trade ambassador Katherine Tai last month expressing their concern on Chinese car companies gaining ground abroad and using Mexico as a \"backdoor\" to enter the U.S. Chinese automakers BYD, SAIC Motors, and Chery are all looking at building plants in Mexico, and Chery Mexico's executive vice president told us the automaker has a plan to enter the U.S.\n\nRecently, Mexico became America's largest trading partner, surpassing China. The Financial Times reported earlier this week that U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen stressed the need to apply trade rules properly, including a foreign investment screening with Mexico. But Mexico's Finance minister, Rogelio Ramírez de la O, said it's not a great priority for Mexico to dedicate time to countries other than the U.S., according to the Financial Times.\n\nEarlier this year the European Union launched an investigation into Chinese EVs to protect European automakers. Chinese car companies have also gained ground in the old continent thanks to their lower prices, decent range and quality, hurting domestic automakers. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Biden administration is considering lowering taxes from other Chinese goods that aren't strategically important, but officials haven't made a final decision. Automotive manufacturing and trade with China will likely be key talking points in the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election, so any immediate decision may be held off.",

        "authors": "Steven Rupp",
        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "6.6 liters of displacement, a boost-ready iron block, and a hotter cam make this new crate engine perfect for your hot rod project.\n\nWhile some might pretend that the whole EV deal is inEVitable, us hot rodders know that gasoline is going to power our rides into the foreseeable future. After all, there are millions of internal combustion engines out there to choose from even if no new engine options were available. Thankfully the gearheads at Chevrolet Performance are still working to give us new high-performance internal combustion crate engine options. Last year they announced a crate version of the L8T V-8 (PN 19433748) that powers the newest Chevy Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD trucks (as well as the GMC equivalents). For 2024, Chevrolet Performance is upping its game with a new 523-hp performance version (PN 19435523) of this engine, called the L8P.\n\nWhat's the Displacement of the L8P?\n\nJust like the L8T this performance version is based on, the L8P displaces a glorious 6.6 liters! Yep, that's 400 cubic inches if you live in the country that walked on the moon, and it's the largest LT-based engine ever produced by GM. Yeah, one could argue the iron block adds a bunch of weight, but for those with a plan to add boost, it also means more cylinder strength.\n\nHow Much Power Does the L8P Produce?\n\nThe L8T crate engine is listed at 401 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and a whopping 464 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm. So, how much power does a bigger cam and a few valvetrain tweaks bring to the party? How about 122 hp and 79 lb-ft of torque! Yep, the new hotter-cammed L8P puts out 523 hp at 5,800 rpm and a whopping 543 lb-ft of twist at 4,600 rpm!.\n\nWhat Is the Compression Ratio of the L8P Crate Engine?\n\nThe L8P block is made from cast iron and has six-bolt nodular-iron main bearing caps as well as a forged-steel crank, forged powdered-metal rods, and hypereutectic aluminum pistons! It also has oil-spray cooling for the pistons, which is especially helpful in boosted applications. Compared to an LT1 engine, the compression was dropped from 11.5:1 to an 87-octane- and boost-friendly 10.8:1. Here you can see the slightly deeper pocket of the L8P's pistons that, along with a slightly larger combustion chamber, gives the L8P the compression drop. The bore of the L8P is the same 4.065 inches as a standard LT1, but the stroke was increased from 3.620 inches to 3.860 inches.\n\nWhat Size Camshaft Is in the New L8P Crate Engine?\n\nThe main player adding performance to the L8T crate engine is the Corvette LT2-based billet-steel hydraulic roller camshaft. The camshaft in the L8T came in at a conservative 193/199 duration and 0.500/0.492-inch lift, while the L8P kicks it up to 218/231-duration with 0.549-inches of lift on both the intake and exhaust side with an LSA of 121-degrees. Like most GM crate engines we've dealt with, the L8P really responds well to even a small cam upgrade. The new cam is non-AFM (Active Fuel Management) and while the heads are based on the production L8T pieces, they have specific performance-oriented valvetrain changes and a new part number.\n\nIs the L8P Still Direct-Injection?\n\nThe L8P is a direct-injected deal, so the fuel injector enters the equation in the combustion chamber opposite the spark plug. This means there's a 2,175-psi high-pressure fuel pump, driven off a lobe on the back of the camshaft, located under the intake to the rear of the valley cover. The L8P heads have large and high-flowing intake ports with the same 2.126-inch intake valves as the LT1 and Inconel exhaust valves that can stand up to the higher exhaust temps of running boost.\n\nDoes the L8P Have a Dedicated Engine Controller Available?\n\nThe new crate L8T engine can run any intake manifold the LT1 can, and there's a wide array of aftermarket oil pans already on the market to make swapping this engine into your project nearly painless. The L8P will ship from Chevrolet Performance sometime in 2024 as a complete crate engine and will even have Connect and Cruise options. It will also be able to run the same accessory drive system as the L8T (with or without A/C) and Chevrolet Performance has already developed an E-93 ECU Controller-based kit (PN 19435524) to make dropping this new crate engine into your hot rod even easier. As for a transmission, Chevrolet Performance recommends their 6L80-E six-speed automatic. In a time when it seems the automakers and the government are out to end internal-combustion engines it warms our heart to see Chevrolet continue to develop new high-performance, gas-swilling crate engines for our hot rods!\n\nL8P Crate Engine Tech Specs\n\n    Part number: 19435523\n    Engine type: Gen V small-block V-8; direct injection, spark ignition\n    Displacement: 400 cubic inches (6.6 liters)\n    Bore x Stroke (in / mm): 4.065 x 3.860 (103.25mm x 98mm)\n    Block (P/N 19420904): Cast-iron with six-bolt nodular-iron main bearing caps\n    Crankshaft (P/N 12708884): Forged steel\n    Connecting rods (P/N 12675746): Forged powdered-metal\n    Pistons (P/N 12737834-R, 12737835-L): Hypereutectic aluminum\n    Camshaft type (P/N 12736191): Billet-steel hydraulic roller\n    Valve lift (in): 0.549 intake / 0.549 exhaust\n    Camshaft duration (at 0.050 in): 218-degree intake / 231-degree exhaust\n    Cylinder heads (P/N 12736192): Aluminum rectangular port D/I with 59.02cc chambers\n    Valve size (in): 2.130 hollow intake / 1.590 Inconel exhaust\n    Compression ratio: 10.8:1 (nominal)\n    Rocker arms (P/N 12619829): Investment-cast roller-trunnion\n    Rocker arm ratio: 1.8:1\n    Intake manifold (P/N 12639087): Composite\n    Throttle body (P/N 12730580): 87mm diameter (single-bore)\n    Fuel delivery: High-pressure direct-injection (2,175 psi / 150 bar)\n    Recommended fuel: Premium unleaded—91 (R+M)/2\n    Ignition system: Coil-on-plug\n    Maximum recommended RPM: 6000 rpm\n    Reluctor wheel: 58X\n    Balance: Internal",

        "date": "2023-02-28",
        "articleBody": "Holding, a four-part adaptation of Graham Norton's debut novel, is coming to Acorn TV on Monday, March 6. Set in Duneen, a small town in West Cork, Ireland, it follows local police sergeant PJ Collins (Conleth Hill) as he investigates the first big-time case of his career. Ahead of its premiere, we're taking the opportunity to get to know Hill, a versatile and highly accomplished actor, a little bit better.\n\nHe was born and raised in Ballycastle, a seaside town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.\n\nHill has described himself as a \"performance-oriented\" child who was interested in acting from a young age. \"The circus used to come to the field next to the house I lived in when I was a child until I was about seven. That would have been my first experience of lights and performance,\" he told The Arts Desk. \"I would be a liar if I said I loved Shakespeare. At secondary school we did lots of Gilbert & Sullivan and [then I] went to art college for a year, took a year out, went to drama school and started work.\"\n\nHe played Lord Varys in Game of Thrones.\n\nHill appears in 46 episodes of the massive fantasy show as Varys, a courtier who pretends to be humble and unassuming, but is actually super-clued-up and one step ahead of his rivals. Because he shaved off his hair for the role, Hill has said that people often got \"freaked out\" when they saw him looking less than bald between seasons.\n\nHis younger brother Ronan Hill also worked on Game of Thrones.\n\nRonan is a production sound mixer who won no fewer than five Emmys for his work on the HBO show. His other sound mixing credits include Line of Duty, The Fall, and the Steve McQueen/Michael Fassbender movie Hunger.\n\nHe is an award-winning stage actor.\n\nHill has performed in dozens of stage productions since launching his acting career in the mid-1980s, mainly in London and Belfast, but also in New York. He has won two Olivier Awards – the top prize in British theater – and also has two Tony nominations to his name. These came in 2001, for his performance in the Irish black comedy play Stones in His Pockets, and in 2008, for his performance opposite Ciarán Hinds in another tragicomedy, The Seafarer????.\n\nHe starred in a sitcom with Jennifer Saunders.\n\nIn 2007's The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle, Saunders portrays a fictional, Jerry Springer-style talk show host who is perhaps a little too desperate for success. Hill co-stars as Jared, her husband, a kept man who happens to be gay. And their dynamic is interesting, to say the least.\n\nHe also made a memorable guest appearance in Peter Kay's Car Share, a popular British comedy series.\n\nHill plays Elsie, a drunk co-worker of Kay's character John who is dressed as Smurfette. He had previously worked with Kay on Britain's Got the Pop Factor, a spoof of reality shows like Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor. \n\nExplaining his decision to cast Hill as Elsie, Kay said at the time: \"Conleth and I became very good friends after I met him whilst I was in The Producers [in the West End]. I really think he's one of the funniest most naturally talented people I know. He had already played Geraldine's Mum in Britain's Got the Pop Factor, so I knew he could play a woman and I thought it'd be a lot of fun. Luckily he wasn't working on Game Of Thrones, so was able to do it.\"\n\nMore recently, he appeared in Hugh Laurie's Agatha Christie adaptation, Why Didn't They Ask Evans?\n\nHill plays Dr. Thomas, a golf-loving medic who is present when his caddy Bobby (Will Poulter) discovers a dead body. Soon enough, the previously good-natured doctor begins to suspect that his own life is in danger, too. As you'd expect from Agatha Christie, it's twisty, impossible-to-predict stuff. \n\nHe enjoyed childhood holidays in beautiful West Cork, where Holding was filmed.\n\nThough he grew up in Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., Hill has spent plenty of time across the border in the neighboring Republic of Ireland. \"My dad used to drive from one end of the country to the other during the 1970s,\" he told the Irish Examiner. \"And we'd go down to Cork and Kerry for our summer holidays. Loved the place, love the people. I was familiar with it. I wanted to do more. But [on Holding] you’d be working five days a week and then learning lines for the next week.\"\n\nYou can catch a glimpse of the lovely West Cork scenery in the trailer below.",

        "authors": "Nick Levine",
        "date": "2023-03-09",
        "articleBody": "There's not long to wait – Happy Valley's third and final season is due to premiere on BBC America, AMC+, and Acorn TV in May. But in the meantime, you can watch the thrilling first season on Acorn TV from Monday, March 13. It's a gripping and profoundly emotive six-parter that introduces us to no-nonsense Yorkshire cop Sergeant Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), her troubled sister Clare (Siobhan Finneran), her innocent grandson Ryan (Rhys Connah), and of course her terrifying criminal nemesis Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton).\n\nTo whet your appetite, here are some things you may not know about the zeitgeist-grabbing crime series created by Sally Wainwright.\n\n1. The show's title comes from a local nickname for Calder Valley, where it is set and largely filmed.\n\nWainwright was born in Huddersfield and raised in nearby Sowerby Bridge, which are both locations featured in the series. \"I always work closely with police advisors, who are old police officers who have worked in the area, and one of them told me that is what they call the Valley because of issues with drugs,\" the creator explained earlier his year. \"For me, it reflected the show. It's dark, but it has also got a lot of humor.\"\n\n2. Wainwright has hailed two other TV series as a particular inspiration.\n\nNamely: Juliet Bravo, a 1980s BBC drama about a female police inspector, and Nurse Jackie, the US dramedy in which Edie Falco stars as high-functioning New York City nurse Jackie Peyton.\n\n\"Nurse Jackie had a profound effect on me and I wanted to create my own Jackie Peyton, by turning her into a police officer,\" Wainwright told Radio Times. \"There was also a 2009 documentary called Shed Your Tears and Walk Away by Jez Lewis, about the drug and alcohol culture in [Yorkshire town] Hebden Bridge among a certain age group. It’s really heart-breaking but brilliant. I got the cast to watch it before we started filming season one. It helped set the tone for what we were trying to achieve.\"\n\n3. The song used at the beginning and end of every episode is \"Trouble Town\" by Jake Bugg.\n\nBugg first released this evocative bluesy rock song in 2012, a couple of years before Happy Valley premiered.\n\n4. Wainwright wrote Catherine Cawood with Sarah Lancashire in mind. \n\nThe two women had previously worked together on Last Tango in Halifax, a lighter Yorkshire-set series co-starring Nicola Walker, Derek Jacobi, and Anne Reid. \"I knew I wanted to write something else for Sarah after Last Tango in Halifax, because she was so fantastic in it. And we are more or less the same age,\" Wainwright told GQ. \"When people get older, they just have more stuff going on in their lives, they have more life experience, more personality, and more skeletons in their closets.\"\n\n5. Playing Tommy Lee Royce has literally given Norton nightmares in the past.\n\nThe actor spoke about the mental toll of playing his malevolent Happy Valley character at a recent screening event, saying: \"I do remember from the first series, I had really violent scenes. It was written and filmed much darker, and I would spend ages beating her up. It goes into your subconscious and somehow it emerges in your dreams.\"\n\n6. Lancashire and Siobhan Finneran have known each other for more than 40 years.\n\nAnd they definitely get along well in real life. \"We first met when I was 17,\" Finneran told The Guardian. \"She's a couple of years older and was doing this brilliant theater studies course at Oldham College, which I'd applied to. Sarah and some other students performed at the open day. We met then and eventually did a play together. We've both got a slightly warped sense of humor and we both like a cake. It's always a joy to work with another actress who actually eats cake.\"\n\n7. Rhys Connah had never acted on screen before he landed the role of Ryan. \n\nDespite his inexperience, Wainwright has said he was the \"only actor\" who could play Catherine's grandson. \"I had never auditioned for anything before and I didn't get the full script, because I was nine and it's very violent,\" Connah told GQ. \"I remember reading two different scenes and I didn't think anything of it until a few weeks later when I got the call saying they wanted me for it. Then I remember being on set and having to be told directly: 'Don't look at the camera!'\"\n\n8. The show has some very famous fans.\n\nWainwright has revealed that Amy Schumer sent her a message raving about Happy Valley. And Norton told The Big Issue: \"Apparently Bob Dylan's a massive fan. It’s mad, isn’t it? I love that Bob Dylan is watching this show.\"\n\n9. Catherine and Joyce's favorite Italian eatery, Grappolo, is a real-life restaurant in Huddersfield.\n\nAnd just like in the show, it hosts themed music nights. You can check out the menu (including the wine list that Catherine and Joyce know so well) here. \n\n10. After wrapping the season finale, Lancashire gave candles to the entire cast and crew.\n\nBut not just any candle – a special candle that she made in collaboration with local company Yorkshire Soap. Sharing a photo of \"The Happy Valley Trilogy\" candle on Twitter, the company added: \"During this time she donated to us the police hat and shoulder numbers from season 3 that went on to raise an amazing £4,500 ($5,400) at a charity event organized by The Halifax Ukrainian Club.\"\n\nFans of the show can buy the candle, too, with all profits going to a hospice chosen by Lancashire and Wainwright.",

        "articleBody": "The outspoken revelation by Henson sheds light on the pervasive under-compensation of Black women in Hollywood, echoing the broader systemic inequalities faced by Black women across all professions.\n\nTaraji P. Henson has never been one to mince her words. And during the press run for \"The Color Purple,\" the award-winning actress spoke candidly about the pay disparities for Black women in Hollywood.\n\nDuring a conversation with  Gayle King on SiriusXM, Henson broke down in tears when she recalled a moment when she contemplated leaving her acting career.\n\n“I’m just tired of working so hard, being gracious at what I do, being paid a fraction of the cost,” Henson said. “I’m tired of hearing my sisters say the same thing over and over. You get tired.”\n\n“I hear people go, ‘You work a lot.’ I have to. The math ain’t mathing,” she said. “Big bills come with what we do. We don’t do this alone. The fact that we’re up here, there’s a whole entire team behind us. They have to get paid.”\n\nThis isn't the first time Henson has spoken out about the paltry payments she's received for her roles. In 2019, she told Variety she asked for $500,000 for “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” only to receive $150,000 for the role.\n\nHer brave stance speaks volumes about the systemic inequities ingrained not only in the film industry but in every corner of our society where Black women fight an uphill battle for fair pay.\n\nThe heart of the matter transcends Hollywood's glitz and glamor; it is a microcosm of the wider socioeconomic landscape where Black women are consistently undervalued and underpaid. Statistics lay bare this harsh reality: Black women earn, on average, substantially less than their white male counterparts and even their white female counterparts across various professions. This chasm persists despite their proven competence, proficiency, and academic qualifications.\n\nThe reasons behind this persistent wage gap are multifaceted and deeply entrenched in historical discrimination and systemic biases. Racial and gender biases intersect to create a formidable barrier that obstructs the professional progress and equitable compensation of Black women. Black women face the daunting challenge of breaking through a glass ceiling reinforced by deeply ingrained stereotypes and structural inequalities.\n\nFor too long, society has turned a blind eye to the multifaceted burdens Black women bear, juggling the weight of racial discrimination and gender disparities while striving to excel in their careers.\n\nHenson's bold stance is a call to dismantle the barriers that obstruct the path to economic parity for Black women. Her courage to speak out challenges us all to confront and rectify the systemic inequities that impede the progress of Black women in Hollywood and in every profession.",

        "articleBody": "Black History Month along with other monthly heritage-themed commemorations will no longer be formally observed in the city. \n\nOfficial citywide observances of Black History will no longer occur in Huntington Beach, Calif., after a decision by the city to do away with such celebrations.\n\nAccording to the , Black History Month along with other monthly heritage-themed commemorations such as Hispanic Heritage, Women’s History and Pride Months will not be formally honored in favor of focusing on the history of the city. On Tuesday (Dec 19), city staffers were tasked with developing a history program that centers on “the founding of the city, the discovery of oil, and celebrating local libraries” to replace diversity celebrations.\n\nCouncilmember Casey McKeon, who was one of the three council members proposing the changes noted that the observances could take place  \n\n“Nothing precludes those events from being a part of that future calendar,” McKeon said.\n\nIn their official report, Mayor Gracey Van Der Mark, McKeon, and Councilmember Pat Burns explicitly wrote that their proposal “would be intended to be free of any identity politics and political agendas.”\n\nAdditionally, Van Der Mark requested that the city’s celebration in January include a Holocaust memorial.\n\nKathie Schey, who chairs the Historic Resources Board of the city, announced her resignation during public comment because of the council’s decision.\n\n“God knows I’m all about celebrating history, right?” Schey explained “This is just peculiar, for want of a better word. Both the approach of the plan and the items that are listed here.”\n\nCouncilmember Natalie Moser stated that developing a comprehensive program is not where the city or council should be focusing its attention because it would involve “confronting darker chapters” of the city’s history.\n\n“I think that this proposal, while perhaps rooted in good intention, raises fundamental questions about the role of our council and priorities of our city,” Moser argued.\n\nAgreeing with Moser’s sentiments, Councilmember Dan Kalmick said a lot of the proposed history that the city wants to honor has nothing to do with Huntington’s story. \n\n“Some of this is not relevant to Huntington Beach,” Kalmick said. “Revolutionary War? We weren’t even part of the British territory at the time … I don’t know why there is a rush to implement some of this.”\n\nThis is the latest example of the Republican majority of  Huntington City Council rolling back diversity  The council voted in February to ban flying the LGBTQ+ Pride Flag and other flags on government property only allowing “city, state, national and prisoner of war banners” to be flown.\n\nIn September, the council voted to dissolve the city’s Human Relations committee – which sought to combat hate crimes.",

For example, a vase is a practical gift for someone who loves flowers, and a journal is a practical gift for someone who loves to write. Remember to consider how the intended recipient will use the gift.\nInterests\n\nPay attention to the interests of those around you. Ask yourself: how do they spend their free time? What do they talk about most? What does their perfect day include? A present will feel infinitely more special when a person’s hobbies and interests are considered.\n\n“Listen for any hints throughout the year and start a note on your phone for each person,” says Lindsay Roberts Schey, creator of the gift recommendation website The Gift Insider. “This helps tremendously when it comes to purchasing Christmas gifts for your loved ones.”",

        "articleBody": "Another Levain favorite, the seasonal dark chocolate-peppermint cookie, inspired this riff. We turned down the chocolate flavor (cocoa and semisweet chips instead of dark chocolate) but intensified the mint by processing Starlight mint candies into a fine peppermint sugar that’s creamed with the butter in the dough. \n\n Tips for Making Chocolate-Peppermint Cookies\n\nKeep these helpful Test Kitchen tips in mind when making this copycat cookie recipe.\n\n    Use a food processor to crush the candies. Add candies and pulse until desired texture. Very finely crushed peppermint candies are the texture of sanding sugar. Finely crushed peppermint candies are 1/8- to 1/4-inch chunks.\n    The peppermint-sugar coating melts into the cookies quickly as they bake. For an extra dose of holiday cheer, sprinkle additional peppermint chips and mint candies on top the last couple minutes of baking. Our recipe testers loved adding these Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Mix-Ins.\n\nHow to Make Perfectly Round Cookies\n\nTo achieve consistent bakery-style rounds, try this trick with just-baked cookies. Using a 5- to 6-inch round cookie cutter in a swirling motion, shape the edges of the cookie until perfectly round (you aren't getting rid of any part of the cookie edge, but molding edge into a perfect circle). Because the cookies are still warm they're flexible enough to change shape minimally without breaking.\nHow to Store Chocolate-Peppermint Cookies\n\nTo store this peppermint-chocolate cookie recipe, place baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months. \n\nIngredients\n\n    1 cup salted butter, softened\n\n    1 cup packed dark brown sugar\n\n    1/4 cup granulated sugar\n\n    1/4 cup very finely crushed peppermint candies\n\n    2 large eggs\n\n    1 teaspoon vanilla\n\n    2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n\n    1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n    1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n    1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n    1 cup semisweet chocolate chips\n\n    1 cup peppermint-flavored chips or 6 oz. chocolate-peppermint squares, chopped\n\n    1/4 cup granulated sugar\n\n    1/4 cup finely crushed peppermint candies\n\n\nDirections\n\n    In a large mixing bowl beat butter with a mixer until creamy. Add brown sugar, 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, and the very finely crushed candies. Beat on medium until very light, 3 minutes. Scrape bowl; beat in eggs and vanilla. Add flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt; beat just until combined. Stir in chips. Cover and chill dough 30 minutes.\n\n    Line a tray or cookie sheet with parchment paper. In a shallow dish combine 1/4 cup granulated sugar and and the finely crushed candies. Portion dough into eight even pieces. Shape the portions into balls. Gently dip half of each dough ball into sugar mixture. Place, sugar side up, on prepared tray. Freeze 4 to 24 hours.\n\n    Adjust oven rack to middle position. Preheat oven to 400°F. Arrange four dough balls 4-inches apart, sugar side up, on a parchment-lined large cookie sheet. Bake 6 minutes (do not open oven). Adjust temperature to 350ºF. Bake until edges are firm and cookies appear set, about 14 minutes more. Remove from cookie sheet; cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough balls.",

        "articleBody": "The artists in the running discuss the category's first class and how they hope this step will inspire the industry going forward.\n\n After Harvey Mason Jr. embarked on a series of trips to Africa in 2022 that were “guided by curiosity,” the Recording Academy CEO and the organization at large were determined to become an “effective collaborator” for the creative communities across the continent. The first step arrived this year, when the category of best African music performance was unveiled. “Artists throughout the U.S., Africa and worldwide see this as a pivotal acknowledgment by the academy that African music has achieved extraordinary impact [and] influence throughout the globe,” chief awards and industry officer Ruby Marchand says. The academy’s African music genre manager, Shawn Thwaites, agrees, noting that the addition not only reflects the current music landscape but also “Africa’s profound influence on music history.” As Mason says, it is “the beginning of our journey to serve global music creators even more ambitiously.”\n\nHere, each of the nominees discuss the historic new category — and what it means for African music’s future. \n\n How did you feel when you heard about the new best African music performance category?\n\nAsake: I felt excited and grateful at the same time because African music and traditions have been a direct influence on the world for far too long to not have its own category. It is a great moment to be a part of.\n\nWhat was your reaction to your collaboration, “Amapiano,” being nominated?\n\nOlamide: Watching all the hard work pay off after our team has dominated the African continent and the world over the years is a blessing and a huge win already.\n\nWhat do you think of this first class of nominees?\n\nAsake: It is a brilliant, diverse and very necessary first class of nominees. Thank you to the team at the Recording Academy for coming up with this and giving us the reach we deserve.\n\nHow do you think this first year of the category will positively affect the industry?\n\nAsake: Every young artist coming up out there can now relate to the fact that their dreams are valid and can now be showcased on the biggest stage in music.\n\nOlamide: The category will greatly impact the industry. African music has exploded globally over the years and will now be exposed on a large scale to the rest of the world.\n\n\nHow did you feel when you heard about the new best African music performance category?\n\nIt’s a significant milestone, not only for me, but for the entire African music industry. It’s a testament to the global recognition and appreciation of the diverse and rich musical traditions coming out of Africa, which I am a part of. This category symbolizes a bridge connecting the world to our continent. [It is] something I have believed in and pushed for, so I couldn’t be prouder to see it come to fruition.\n\nWhat is it like to be nominated in the category’s historic first class?\n\nIt’s an immense honor. It’s like being part of history in the making. This category represents a platform for the incredible diversity and talent within the landscape of African music. It’s a moment of celebration for every African artist who has contributed to our vibrant music scene.\n\nHow do you think this first year of the category will positively affect the industry?\n\nIt is a game-changer for African musicians. It opens up a new world of opportunities for African artists to gain global recognition and reach wider audiences. It will also encourage more collaborations and cultural exchanges within the music industry. This category not only celebrates African talent but also fosters a sense of pride and achievement within the community. It certainly makes the Grammys more accessible to African artists.\n\n How did you react to “Unavailable,” which features Musa Keys, being nominated?\n\nI was so happy. I feel like this moment was a long time coming for me, and I’m extremely grateful.\n\nHow does it feel to not only be nominated but be included in the category’s historic first class? \n\n It feels like further breaking the glass ceiling into the mainstream. Step by step, African influences and artists are getting more shine within the industry, and this feels like another win toward being acknowledged. To be a part of this historic moment is an honor.\n\nWhat do you think of this first class of nominees?\n\nI think it’s a well-curated group. Obviously, there’s so much talent in the African music community and definitely some other names I’d include, but I look forward to seeing future nominees in this category. And hopefully, more categories specifically for African music will be created in the future, too. This first year will definitely set the tone.\n\n How did you feel when you heard about the new best African music performance category?\n\nI was quite elated because it shows inclusivity. Beyond being African artists, this category shows that the world is watching and seeing the effort we put in and does not mind giving us our flowers to smell.\n\nHow does it feel to not only be nominated for “Rush” but be represented in this category’s historic first class?\n\nIt feels iconic. To be doing this at 21? Whew! [It’s so] mind-blowing for me that I sometimes have to pinch myself that it’s all real and I’m not dreaming.\n\nWhat do you think of this first class of nominees?\n\nI think everyone in this category is badass, and I can only imagine the amount of tough work it took to put together these incredible artists in a category, all truly amazing artists I look up to and I’m proud to be nominated alongside.\n\nHow did you feel when you heard about the new best African music performance category?\n\n Hearing about the new category was very exciting because growing up, I watched the Grammys every year and watched all my favorite artists get awarded and nominated. It was something that I always imagined, and now that there’s a whole category dedicated to African artists, it means so much. I feel like it’s going to open so many more doors for us African artists and introduce our sound and artists to the world.\n\nWhat is it like to not only be nominated but be included in this category’s first class?\n\nBeing nominated for a Grammy is such an honor, but the fact that I’m nominated for the first time in a category that’s an African category [in the year it has] been introduced, I couldn’t have asked for a better moment. I just feel super blessed, happy and excited to attend and enjoy the evening no matter what the outcome is. It’s such a huge moment for Africa, and I’m so happy I get to be a part of it.\n\nWhom will you bring to the Grammys?\n\nYou know me. If I could, I would bring all of South Africa — but I’m sure my mama and papa will be there.",

        "articleBody": "The members of BTS are going solo — but don’t worry, they are not disbanding.\n\nJust days after the release of their anthology album Proof — released as a celebration of the septet’s ninth anniversary — RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook shared in a video posted June 14, 2022, that they plan to take a break from group activities so they can all have time to work on personal and solo endeavors.\n\nThough the respite will give BTS much-needed time to work on their solo efforts — not to mention perform the mandatory military service — the group has already given fans a taste of what they are capable of apart from the group. RM, who functions as the leader of the group and member of BTS’ rap line (alongside Suga and J-Hope), was the first to drop solo material. In 2015, he released a self-titled mixtape via SoundCloud that contained a total of 11 tracks, some of which sampled songs by J. Cole, Drake, Run the Jewels and more.\n\nSuga followed shortly after with the arrival of his Agust D mixtape in 2016, while J-Hope followed in 2018 with Hope World. (RM put out a second mixtape, Mono., in late 2018, while Suga put out his second tape, D-2, in May 2020). \n\nHere are all of BTS’ solo projects and songs — not including covers, solo tracks released through (or featuring members of) BTS, or features on other artists’ songs.\n\nRM - 'RM' (2015) & 'Mono' (2018)\n\nRM was the first member to release a solo project and shared his self-titled mixtape, RM, on March 20, 2015. The mixtape, which contained a total of 11 tracks, saw the BTS group leader reflecting on his doubt and internal struggles while also affirming his belief in himself as a talented rapper. The mixtape contained three singles: “Do You,” “Awakening” and “Joke.”\n\nRM later followed up his debut mixtape with the release of Mono in 2018. This time around, the rapper went for a more collaborative effort with writing and producing the tracks, tapping Honne, Supreme Boi, Sam Klempner, Hiss Noise, Adora and more to craft the mixtape’s more introspective sound. “Forever Rain” was released as the only single from the body of work. The album charted at No. 26 on the Billboard 200.\n\nSuga - 'Agust D' (2016) & 'D-2' (2020)\n\nAgust D, Suga‘s debut mixtape, arrived in 2016 — and with it, a bold new persona and stage name for the BTS rapper. The release was a departure for the BTS star, highlighting his hardcore rap and underground influences with help from writer-producers Slow Rabbit, June, Pdogg and Supreme Boi. “Agust D” and “give it to me” were released as the two singles for the project.\n\nSuga followed up the mixtape in 2020 with D-2. The mixtape was helpful to the rapper as he started focusing on his experiences as a then-28-year-old as opposed to reflecting on his past. The mixtape was commercially successful, charting at No. 9 on the Top Rap Albums chart and No. 11 on the Billboard 200.\n\nJ-Hope - 'Hope World' (2018), 'Jack in the Box' (2022)\n\nJ-Hope is the only rapper of BTS with only one mixtape out, but he’s hard at work on a new album. Hope’s solo debut, Hope World, arrived in 2018 and served as an introduction to him as a rapper outside of BTS and a reflection on his road to becoming a producer. The project, led by singles “Daydream” and “Airplane,” charted at No. 19 on Top Rap Albums and No. 38 on the Billboard 200.\n\nHe revealed on June 26, 2022, that his solo album, Jack in the Box, would be arriving on July 15, making him the first member of BTS to launch a solo release after the global superstars announced that they would be taking some time to focus on their personal projects. According to the press release, Jack in the Box “represents [J-Hope’s] aspirations to break the mold and grow further.” The album’s first single, “More,” is set to arrive shortly before the full set, on July 1.\n\nJ-Hope - \"Chicken Noodle Soup\" feat. Becky G (2019)\n\nJ-Hope reintroduced “Chicken Noodle Soup” to a brand-new generation and had Latin pop star Becky G assist him on the throwback track, complete with the original dance moves from DJ Webstar and Young B.’s 2006 hit.\n\nJin - \"Yours\" & \"Super Tuna\" (2021), \"Abyss\" (2020), \"Tonight\" (2019)\n\nJin most recently lent his musical chops to the South Korean television drama series Jirisan and contributed the track “Yours” to the television show’s official soundtrack. Single “Super Tuna” additionally arrived on the singer’s 29th birthday, serving as a fun and playful gift to fans.\n\nThe singer also released a wistful solo track in 2020 titled “Abyss,” which was a birthday gift from him to his fans. In the track, he discusses fading out into darkness, inspired in part by his struggles with feeling insecure about his music. Jin’s first solo track “Tonight” was shared as part of BTS’ annual Festa party in 2019.\n\nJimin - \"With You\" (2022), \"Christmas Love\" (2020) & \"Promise\" (2018)\n\nJimin teamed up with former Wanna One member Ha Sung Woon for their collaborative track “With You,” released as part of the soundtrack for South Korean drama series Our Blues. In May, the track topped Billboard‘s Hot Trending Songs and spent a total of seven weeks and counting on the chart.\n\nJimin also gave BTS ARMY a new Christmas song to add to their rotation, sharing the sentimental — and seasonally appropriate — track “Christmas Love” just two days before Christmas 2020. Jimin’s first solo track, “Promise,” was released in 2018 via SoundCloud.\n\nJung Kook - \"My You\" & \"Stay Alive\" (2022), \"Still With You\" (2020)\n\nIt’s been a busy year for Jung Kook‘s solo ventures — the singer released solo track “My You” in June on BTS’ ninth anniversary as a gift to fans. The lyrics of the track honor Jung Kook’s relationship with BTS ARMY; he additionally thanked fans for standing by him and allowing him to live a blessed life. Earlier in the year, “Stay Alive” was released as part of BTS’ 7 Fates: Chako webtoon (Jung Kook appeared in the webtoon as Zeha). Jung Kook shared his first single, “Still With You,” in 2020 as part of BTS’ annual Festa party.\n\nV - \"Christmas Tree\" (2022), \"Snow Flower\" (2020), \"Scenery\" & \"Winter Bear\" (2019), 'In the Soop: Friendcation' (2022)\n\nV‘s first solo tracks outside of BTS arrived in 2019, releasing the ballads “Scenery” and “Winter Bear” (the latter of which was release entirely in English). “Snow Flower,” a collaborative Christmas track released on SoundCloud alongside Peakboy, followed in 2020 and saw the singer continue his love of slow-burning, romantic tracks. V also followed in the footsteps of his BTS bandmates, most recently going solo to contribute “Christmas Tree” to the soundtrack for South Korean drama series Our Beloved Summer.\n\nOn July 6, In the Soop announced that V had joined the docuseries In the Soop: Friendcation, with episodes first airing on a Korean TV network and Hotstar in the Asia-Pacific region. The show will come to Disney+ worldwide at a later date.\n\nJin - \"The Astronaut\" (2022)\n\nJin announced during the Yet to Come concert in Busan on Oct. 15 that a solo single was coming soon. “I got the opportunity to work with someone I like, so a single will come out soon,” he teased from the stage of the show, which was livestreamed to fans around the world.\n\nOn Oct. 28, Jin unveiled  “The Astronaut,” co-written with Coldplay, and the entire song reveals the stadium-sized rock sound that the British band is known for as a perfect bed for Jin’s steady, soothing vocals.\n\nJung Kook - \"Dreamers\" (2022)\n\nJung Kook dropped the video for his solo track “Dreamers” on Nov. 28, in which the singer explores Qatar, the site of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The dreamy song that is part of the official soundtrack of the global football classic that kicked off this week in the tiny Middle Eastern country features Jung Kook singing alongside Qatari artist Fahad Al-Kubaisi.\n\nRM - ‘Indigo’ (2022)\n\nRM finally unveiled his long-awaited debut solo album Indigo on December 2 with guests assists from the likes of Erykah Badu (opener “Yun”), Anderson .Paak (“Still Life”), Epik High leader Tablo (“All Day”), Paul Blanco and Mahalia (the Honne-produced “Closer”) and more.\n\nEarlier, on Nov. 22, RM teased the album’s themes in a preview video that read, “Record of RM: Indigo. From the colors of nature, human, etc. Documentation of my youth in the moment of independent phase. Sun-bleached record faded like old jeans. The last archive of my twenties.”\n\nJimin - ‘FACE’ (2023)\n\nJimin announced details about his first solo album, FACE, which arrived on March 24, with a 35-second video featuring ambient music and a series of water droplets spinning out ripples on the surface of water that eventually form the album’s title.\n\nJimin’s first full-length solo album follows on the heels of his hit single with fellow K-pop singer TAEYANG of BIG BANG, “Vibe,” which gave both stars their first visit to the Hot 100. To date, Jimin has released the solo songs “Lie” and “Serendipity,” as well as the song “With You’” from the soundtrack to the TvN drama Our Blues.\n\nSuga - 'Road to D-Day' (2023)\n\nIn Road to D-Day, which arrived April 21, Suga travels the world, with the trailer showing a montage of snapshots of cities around the globe (Seoul, Tokyo, Pyeongchang, Chuncheon, Las Vegas, Malibu and San Francisco.\n\n“This is my first time walking down this road. I’m really excited right now,” he says in the clip while taking a late-night walk while wearing a face mask in the video in which he jets around the globe on his own — including taking a sunset drive through the desert.\n\n“Whenever a concert ends and I go in [and say] ‘Ah, I’m tired.’ No like, it’s my first time doing this in my life! Even in Korea I’ve never done this before,” he says in the translation of his inner monologue in the video preview.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nSuga - 'D-DAY' (2023)\n\nOn April 2, Suga announced that his first solo album would soon be dropping. D-DAY — released under the name Agust D — arrived April 21, and is the final piece of his mixtape trilogy.\n\nSuga - \"Lilith (Diablo IV Anthem)\" with Halsey (2023)\n\nThe BTS rapper signed on for a re-imagining of pal Halsey’s If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power track “Lilith,” which arrived June 6. The reworking of the song was done in collaboration with Blizzard Entertainment for the latest installment of Diablo, a series that Suga has previously enjoyed. The K-pop star raps a new verse on the track, and also appears alongside Halsey in the dark, gothic music video.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, the “I Am Not a Woman, I’m a God” singer praised the BTS member for his part of the collab. “Together, we were able to infuse the anthem with intricate narratives that encompass a wider range of emotions I wouldn’t have been able to tell without him,” she said at the time. “He added a whole new perspective to the song. Plus, it was just honestly really cool to do something so badass with my friend.”\n\nJung Kook - \"Seven\" (2023)\n\nBIGHIT Music announced via Weverse on June 29, 2023, that Jung Kook’s next solo single would be arriving July 14, and is titled “Seven.” The announcement described the song as “an invigorating summer song” that will give fans “the full breadth of Jung Kook’s charm.”\n\nV - 'Layover' (2023)\n\nV’s debut solo effort, Layover, will drop on Sept. 8. The collection will feature six tracks: “Rainy Days,” “Blue,” “Love Me Again,” “Slow Dancing,” For Us” and a bonus track piano version of “Slow Dancing.”\n\nJung Kook - 'GOLDEN' (2023)\n\nJung Kook announced his first solo album, GOLDEN, would arrive on Nov. 3, 2023. The press release described the 11-song album as a project that takes its theme from “the golden moments of Jung Kook as a solo artist.”\n\nJimin - \"Closer Than This\" (2023)\n\nJimin gave ARMY an early Christmas present when he dropped his solo single “Closer Than This” on Dec. 22, 2023. BigHit described the track as a “heartfelt fan song that encapsulates Jimin’s genuine feelings for ARMY.”",

But progress hasn’t been easy — or cheap.\n\nIn 2017, Hennepin County, Minnesota, was home to hundreds of people considered chronically homeless. Many had been on the streets for more than a year; others had cycled in and out over the past few. All had some sort of disability, addiction or illness that made stability elusive.\n\nOver the next six years, more than 1,500 once-homeless residents were moved into permanent housing — places like single-room occupancy units, group homes or homeless-dedicated units with support services. By the end of 2023, the county’s chronically homeless population has shrunk to 315, down nearly 36% just since November 2021.\n\nHennepin County, which includes parts of Minneapolis and is home to 1.26 million people, managed that dramatic reduction via a combination of funding, deep community engagement and a housing-first approach that’s matched with real housing resources, local officials say.\n\n“What we believe is kind of the secret sauce here is that housing is always the goal,” said Danielle Werder, the area manager of Hennepin County’s Office to End Homelessness. “But you need to invest in both places for people to go, and people to help get them there.”\n\nThe county’s progress on housing this extra-vulnerable population makes Hennepin County something of a national outlier. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness in the US grew 12% in 2023, to reach the highest level recorded since the agency began tracking it in 2007. Chronic homelessness grew by the same proportion. In 2023, nearly a third of all homeless people experienced chronic patterns of homelessness; almost two-thirds were unsheltered, but the number of chronically homeless people in shelters is growing, too. States like California, Florida and New Mexico saw among the largest increases in chronic homelessness over the past year, with West Coast cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and Seattle clocking the highest overall numbers alongside New York City.\n\nEnding chronic homelessness became a priority for Hennepin County starting in 2017. The county is one of 100 US communities working with the nonprofit Community Solutions on their homelessness response, using a methodology the organization calls Built for Zero. In pursuit of ending homelessness overall, each community tends to start with a specific subgroup, like veterans or families, that they aim to bring down to a “functional zero” — defined by Community Solutions as the level at which “a community has fewer people entering homelessness than the number of people who can be housed in a month.” For Hennepin County, that number is three.\n\nLeaving chronic homelessness doesn’t just mean leaving the streets — it means getting out of shelters and into permanent housing. Hennepin Count hopes to reach functional zero by 2025.\n\n“You’ve got to start somewhere. If the problem is super-big and insurmountable, then drill in and start with a set population, like chronic homelessness,” said Werder. “Figure out what’s the most burning issue, who needs the most support, and really put resources and attention there.”\n\nFor Hennepin County, the hope is that this single-minded focus on housing the 12% of the total homeless population who have been homeless for the longest will ultimately translate into broader progress on a problem confounding so many US cities. But the structural forces that are driving new people out of their homes in this region are daunting. According to the latest HUD count, the county’s overall homelessness rates increased 24% in 2023 after a period of steady declines. Family homelessness in the Minneapolis metro area grew especially quickly, swelling by almost 80%, with a rate of change second only to Denver and Chicago.\n\nThe housing challenges in Minnesota mirror national trends. Hennepin County saw rents rise 17% between 2000 and 2019, while average renter incomes stagnated. In 2021, the Minnesota Housing Partnership found that 22% of all renter households in the county were extremely cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than half of their income on housing each month. Federal investment in housing assistance and permanent supportive housing resources hasn’t kept up with need. The US opioid crisis that’s driving overdose deaths and destabilizing households hasn’t spared Hennepin County, whose Native American population has been hit particularly hard. Large encampments emerged around the city in recent years — flashpoints for community debate over how best to tackle the issue. \n\nBut looking at where they’re beating the odds is more instructive. Besides cutting chronic homelessness, Hennepin County has also managed to reduce its unsheltered population by 22% since 2019, while the country’s totals moved in the opposite direction. As they build a system that is working to house the most vulnerable, they could offer important lessons for other cities, says Ann Oliva, the chief executive officer of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “They used their Covid money to do some innovations, to ask people what they wanted and needed,” she said. “And then they built a program responsive to that.”\n\nNow they have to sustain that progress, and the Covid-era funding that fueled Hennepin County’s response is running dry. That includes $46 million for creating or preserving affordable housing, $36 million to hire more case workers and expand shelter capacity, and $24.8 million from the CARES Act for emergency rental assistance and emergency shelter. In 2022, the county’s homelessness response program faced a $13 million-a-year fiscal cliff; since then, Minnesota has jumped in with a one-time allocation of funding to push the cliff out to 2025, and the county has found enough resources to make some case workers hired with Covid money permanent.\n\n“It was a strategic and innovative investment by the county to prove the model,” said Werder. “And then it was almost like we couldn't look away once we knew that this worked.”\nKnowing Names\n\nAs a coordinated entry assessor for Hennepin County, Shae Roberts spends her days “going to where the people are.” Once homeless herself, Roberts is now one of the first points of contact between chronically homeless people and county housing resources. She goes “under the bridges” and into encampments to find this hard-to-reach population and understand their housing needs.\n\nShe’s one of several county staff hired during the pandemic who maintain the homelessness office’s “by-name” list, which provides a daily snapshot of exactly who in the community is experiencing chronic homelessness, including their risk factors and contact information, if they have it. Whenever she meets someone new — or reconnects with someone already in the system — Roberts and her colleagues update the list. The goal is to establish each individual’s unique housing needs, then work to get them into that housing and off the list permanently. \n\nThe “by-name” list is a core strategy of Community Solutions’ Built for Zero model, driven by the idea that having more information about the population can help communities design better responses, and push for a fuller set of resources. “If you can only see 60% of a problem, you only are ever going to be able to advocate for 60% of the resources that you need,” said Beth Sandor, the chief program officer at Community Solutions. It also gives providers a sense of whether and where their investments are actually working to prevent and end periods of homelessness.\n\nThe larger the community, the harder it is to manage such a list, says Oliva. But places of all sizes are trying it: The Denver metro area uses a by-name list to understand its population of veterans experiencing homelessness across seven counties and more than 40 municipalities, Sandor says, and is currently building out the infrastructure to expand it to all populations.\n\nForging personal connections with homeless people allows providers to tailor their interventions, Oliva says, upping the chances that people will get housed and stay housed.\n\nWith a population that’s transient and hard to track, having a daily snapshot of who is moving in and out of the system takes a dedicated workforce and a lot of pavement-pounding. To find the right fit for this work, the Hennepin County office has started to consult with formerly and currently homeless people to inform hiring and funding decisions; many of the office’s service providers have experience with homelessness themselves. “Communities that are disproportionately making progress [are] making sure that the people most affected in experiencing the challenges of the system are at the table in redesigning how that system needs to work,” said Sandor.\n\nUsing pandemic funding, Hennepin County hired about 30 people to staff a Homeless to Housing team and a Streets to Housing team. Since November 2021, they’ve moved 937 people into permanent housing, with a 95% retention rate. Another 464 people who were living in hotel rooms during the pandemic have also been placed in permanent units, with a 96% retention rate.\n\nThey prioritize units based on medical vulnerability, client choice and chronic homelessness status. Homeless dedicated units, which are highly in demand and come with supportive services, go to chronically homeless people and those with health risks first. Single-room occupancy units, which are affordable units that don’t have on-site services, are designated for people who have recently become homeless, whose main barrier to housing may be their economic situation. Shelters should be a last resort, says Werder.\n\n“We’re really trying to not do a one-size-fits-all response,” she said. “The solution truly is to get in there and understand what each person's needs are, and then figuring out how to get them over the finish line.”\nA Climate of Innovation\n\nHennepin County’s approach fits into a long Minnesota legacy of housing innovation. In the late 1990s, this was one of the first US jurisdictions to use the Rapid Re-Housing model, which sought to quickly bring families out of shelters and into homes by providing short-term financial support. In 2018, Minneapolis became the first city to act on what is now a nationwide push to end single-family zoning, hoping to boost affordability and redress residential segregation. In 2020, Minnesota became the first state to allow residents on its basic healthcare plan to use Medicaid waivers for housing and homeless prevention services. In its 2024 budget, the state committed $1 billion to affordable housing construction and programs like rental assistance.\n\nThese policies and investments, combined with extra federal and local funding that were freed up during the pandemic, give Hennepin’s holistic response some teeth: When people express their housing needs, there’s more of a chance that the county can actually meet them.\n\nThe priority is routing people toward new, improved or preserved permanent housing options bolstered by Covid funding, like a growing number of low-rent single-room occupancy units, and freshly renovated units in the state’s affordable Board and Lodge program.\n\nFor those who need more immediate support, Hennepin has also invested in building out its shelter system. Covid funding helped the county open new facilities like a women’s-only shelter, a 100-bed shelter designed specifically for people leaving encampments, and a shelter run by and designed for Indigenous residents. Before the pandemic, Werder says only 180 of the county’s 1,000 shelter beds were available 24-7. Now, three-quarters of them are. Some shelters were also renovated to add extra storage and update bathrooms.\n\nAnother pandemic-era innovation is the Hennepin Shelter Hotline. The phone number centralizes the county’s homeless services, so people don’t have to puzzle through bureaucracy to find the right resources themselves. It’s staffed by a diversion team that tries to identify pathways to permanent housing before making a shelter referral. Up to 50 people a week are being diverted into housing through the hotline, Werder said.\n\n“The whole goal is to avoid them ever having to experience emergency shelter,” said Werder. “Which also means that for the person that has no other resources in the entire world, we now have more space in our emergency shelter system.”\n\nThis investment has an immediate economic payoff, Oliva says, as well as a moral one: Each chronically homeless person costs taxpayer over $35,500 on average each year, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, between jail stays, health-care costs and emergency room visits. Bringing them into supportive housing can reduce this burden by nearly 50%.\n\nThe stakes of bringing unsheltered people inside are inherently higher in a place like Minnesota, where subfreezing winter temperatures can make life on the streets lethal, than in a place like California. That reality has helped create “an environment where they are open to innovation that maybe other communities don't have to think about,” said Oliva. Similarly, major Northeastern cities like Boston and New York City typically have more robust shelter systems than those in the Sun Belt, as well as varying policies establishing rights to shelter.\n\nBut the weather doesn’t fully explain Hennepin County’s success with driving down unsheltered homelessness alongside chronic homelessness, which has relied less on punitive measures like encampment sweeps and more on what Werder calls “progressive engagement.”\n\nWerder acknowledges that, as in other US cities, people in homelessness can be resistant to moving from encampments into shelters or permanent placements. Hennepin County has used Community Solutions funding to bring on a new “stabilization specialist” to help ease what can be a difficult transition period between long-term homelessness and living alone. But none of the unsheltered homeless people social workers talk to have rejected housing outright.\n\n“We may not have the right housing available right now. They may not trust us to help them get into it. They may need to work on expunging a warrant or working on their addiction, treatment work,” she said. “But housing is something that people want.”",

        "articleBody": "American consumers continued to splurge in 2023, boosting the economy with revenge travel, Taylor Swift tickets and expensive restaurant meals. But a lot of it was funded with debt.\n\nCredit card balances in the US increased by about 4.7% to $48 billion in the third quarter alone, pushing the total to $1.08 trillion, according to the New York Federal Reserve. It’s the highest total in data going back to 2003, and that was before the holiday shopping season started in earnest. The bills are mounting at time when the average annual percentage rate, or APR, has soared north of 20% to the highest on record.\n\nThe health of the US consumer will be closely watched as the US Federal Reserve eyes rate cuts in 2024. With the stock market rebounding this year, and many Americans riding the benefits of higher wagers, there is plenty of data indicating that the economy is strong.\n\nAt the same time, an estimated 40% of Americans have drained their pandemic savings to afford ballooning bills. And videos on TikTok are detailing a so-called “silent recession” as millions struggle to keep up with student loan bills, car payments, higher housing costs and elevated grocery bills. That has experts worried that many consumers are increasingly relying on credit cards, and other debt, to cover everyday expenses.\n\n“Consumers have leaned on their available lines of credit for necessities — things we expect consumers to be able to pay with the cash they have on hand,” said Bruce McClary, a spokesperson for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. “But they’re running out of room.”\n\n\n@casseysjourney\n\nThis is not okay! #rant #3minutes #money #depressionanxiety #financialfreedom #crisis #children #babies #parents #struggle #millenial #millenialsoftiktok #millenialproblems #money #moneytok #struggle #house #food #groceries #rent #childcare #unfair #sendhelp\n? It's Gonna Be Alright - Abby\n\nOne specific area of concern is the increasing popularity of “buy now, pay later” services, which typically allow consumers to pay for purchases in four installments, often with no fee unless a payment is missed. The debt is not reported to credit bureaus, meaning no one knows for sure how much is out there.\n\nAdobe Analytics reported consumers using $67 billion worth of the installment loans this year through Cyber Monday, a 16% increase compared with 2022. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, estimated consumers spent about $46 billion using the products this year.\n\nDelinquency rates for credit cards are just slightly above pre-pandemic levels. But economists warn the outlook on consumer debt is starting to darken. Some banks are reducing credit limits and closing unused lines of credit, an indication that consumer debt won’t play the “locomotive role” it did in driving spending in 2024, according to Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n\n“It's not only credit cards where consumers are building up debt, there’s student loans, auto loans. If you look at how much interest costs are eating away paychecks, it’s as big as it’s been since 2008,” said Quinlan. “That’s the worrying measure.”",

        "title": "Benefits of Heart Rate Training By Goals",
        "authors": "Ken Yu",
        "date": "2023-08-18",
        "articleBody": "Why tracking your heart rate could be an important piece to reaching your goals\n\nWith the increasing number of wearable devices, it is easier than ever to effectively track your heart rate and use that information to create an individualized training program based on your goals. While many apps will calculate your individualized heart rate zones, the standard formula of determining your maximum heart rate is 220 - Your Age. You can calculate your heart rate zones by multiplying your max heart rate by the following percentages: 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%. \n\nFor example, If you are 40 years old, your maximum heart rate will be 180 beats per minute. \n\n    Zone 1: 50% - 60% = 90 bpm - 108 bpm\n    Zone 2: 61% - 70% = 109 bpm - 126 bpm\n    Zone 3: 71% - 80% = 127 bpm - 144 bpm\n    Zone 4: 81% - 90% = 145 bpm - 162 bpm\n    Zone 5: 91% - 100% = 162 bpm - 180 bpm\n\nOnce you have this information, you can start using your heart rate data to shape your training. Here are a few guidelines that you can use to identify what type of exercise you should be doing. \n\nImproving Cardiovascular Health\n\nIf your goal is to improve your overall cardiovascular health, you want to focus on light to moderate workouts that elevate your heart rate between zone 1 and zone 2 (50-70% of your maximum heart rate) for extended periods of time. Experts suggest at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week will enhance your overall health by strengthening your heart muscle, increasing pumping efficiency, improving circulation, lowering blood pressure, and reducing risk of cardiac events (1)(2). Cardiovascular exercise will also enhance your lung capacity, oxygen efficiency leading to increased stamina in physical activities and everyday tasks (3). A tracking device can provide real-time feedback which can help keep you motivated in reaching your fitness goals.\n\nLosing Fat\n\nIf your goal is to lose body fat, you want to focus on expending more calories than you consume (4).  You may want to first try moderate intensity workouts that keep your heart rate within zone 2 (60-70% of your maximum heart rate) for extended periods of time. Zone 2 training is generally recommended for fat loss because your body will use fat as your primary sole energy when performing activities under your aerobic threshold.  It also has the added benefits of feeling easier allowing you to exercise for longer durations, recover faster and have less daily muscle soreness (5). \n\nIncreasing Endurance \n\nIf your goal is to increase your cardiovascular endurance, you want to focus on medium intensity workouts that keep your heart rate around your zone 3 (70-80% of your maximum heart rate) for sustained periods.  As you work harder, your body must switch from using fat to using carbohydrates which is referred to as your aerobic capacity. Training within this zone will increase your use of oxygen, your lactate threshold, and your mitochondrial density allowing you to run, bike and swim for longer periods of time (6).   \n\nBuilding Muscle and Burning Fat\n\nIf your goal is to obtain a leaner physique by increasing muscle and losing fat, you want to focus on interval training that alternates between high-intensity intervals (80-90% of your maximum heart rate) and active recovery periods (50-60% of your maximum heart rate). This training can increase anaerobic capacity, boosts metabolism, burn fat, and improves overall fitness (7)(8). This type of training is the most effective and efficient because it will hit all 5 cardiovascular zones. HIIT workouts are typically shorter in duration compared to traditional steady-state cardio sessions but can burn as many as or even more calories. In clinical studies, HIIT has also been shown to be effective in promoting fat loss while preserving lean muscle mass (7). Lastly, HIIT has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation, making it beneficial for managing and preventing type 2 diabetes (9). \n\nOptimization of Rest Days\n\nThe most amazing part of wearable technology is the ability to monitor your daily readiness through heart rate variability (HRV).  Your HRV is a measurement on how ready your body is for exercise. Your HRV scores can guide your decisions on whether to engage in intense workouts or opt for more recovery-focused activities (10). Simply put, if you have a high HRV, you can push yourself. If you have a low HRV, you may want to take a rest day. Listening to your biological markers can effectively lower your risk of overtraining, injuries, fatigue, and burnout.",

        "articleBody": "After an abusive partner nearly beat her to death, Amie Mock began lifting to make sure she would never be weak again. Now, she's gained the muscle, and the emotional strength, to let others know they are not alone.\n\nAmie Mock would love to tell you that she got into lifting for purely aesthetic reasons, but the truth is she started lifting because she knows from hard-earned experience the mental toll of not feeling strong. For three years, Amie had a boyfriend who frequently beat and abused her.\n\nUnfortunately, Amie is not alone. According to current statistics on domestic violence in the United States, it's estimated as many as 1 in 3 women will experience some form of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse committed by an intimate partner.\n\nBeing the victim of stalking, violence, and assault can lead to feelings of powerlessness, which is why so many women, including Amie, turn to the gym. For many, lifting weights is more than just a means to stay fit: it's a way to reclaim lost strength and solidify newfound independence.\n\nFor Amie, lifting has given her more than just muscle. It has helped her discover what true strength is. Now, she is using her platform as a JYM-sponsored athlete and a physique competitor to bring awareness to the pervasiveness of domestic abuse and violence and shed light on an uncomfortable truth: There are a lot of women at the gym just like her.\n\nHere is Amie's story. — H. E.\n\nI went into foster care when I was about 3, and early on I developed the ability to adapt to every new home. They call kids like me \"chameleons,\" blending into different styles, different people, different rules, different schools—even different accents. You learn to adapt very well, to please everyone around you, and to hide and ignore your true feelings.\n\nMy aunt is the one who finally got me out; she moved me back to a small town in Texas. When I got the opportunity to play sports, I saw an outlet that would allow me to get all my pent-up aggression out. I did everything, I played everything, I excelled in everything. I did three times more than anyone else. I wanted to go to college and be a professional athlete.  \n\nA lot of that extra effort came from my subconscious mind telling me I couldn't be a failure like my parents. I just had to keep going, keep pushing. When you're a kid, you're too scared to talk about things that have happened to you. For me, sports were how I coped.\n\nLosing Direction\n\nAs I got older, I just started to veer off track. I started going to parties and doing things I shouldn't do. I did not go to college or get an athletic scholarship. I did not do any of what I had planned on doing.\n\nMy 20s had nothing to do with fitness and everything to do with partying. If you had met me then, you would have thought I was a strong-minded girl. I really thought I was.  \n\nBut now, when I look back at who I was, I realize I only felt strong because I didn't care—that's not being strong. I wasn't taking care of myself and my own issues—all I did was mask them by partying and having fun.\n\nFound By the Wrong Person  \n\nTo a person who's a narcissist, or a sociopath, or a womanizer, someone who puts on a smile on her face and pretends to be OK is the perfect opportunity. They target you because they see you putting on a show, and they know that underneath the mask you are vulnerable.\n\nI got into the bad situation I was in because I was relying on someone else to come in and fix all my problems. That's the worst thing—you're giving them all the power. Anything they say is right, and anything you do is wrong, and you have to believe it because you're trusting them that they're healthy.  \n\nIt took me a bit, but I had to realize I never would've been found by him if I hadn't been lost in the first place. I never confronted any of my abandonment issues about lack of love or abuse. I never took those things on, so all it took for someone to take over my life was for this man to show me any type of attention.\n\nSoon after we got together, he moved me to Virginia. My family's here in Texas, so I was isolated. I was alone, I didn't have a car, I didn't have anything—I relied solely on him.  \n\nIt only took about a month before the abuse started. Looking back, I know I saw all the red flags from the beginning, but I didn't want to admit it to myself.\n\nI Knew I Was Going to Die If I Didn't Get Out\n\nBeing in an abusive relationship is like doing drugs: You go from soaring highs to crashing lows, then it just gets lower and lower.\n\nMy lowest point was realizing that I wasn't strong enough to fight him off. Not just physically, but mentally. It was exhausting.  \n\nThe last time, he beat me so badly he thought he'd killed me. I was lying there as I had so many times before, waiting for him to come and pick me up like a rag doll because I'd never been strong enough to pick myself up before.  \n\nI saw the front door and the light was shining through it, and I knew that was the gateway to freedom. I knew I had to be the one to walk out, because he wasn't going to let me go and I was not going to survive if I didn't get out.  \n\nI got up, and I ran.   \nI Know What Strong Is Now\n\nWhenever I'm under heavy weight and I can't get it up, I go back to that moment. I remember being so weak I couldn't get up, so weak I couldn't get him off me.  \n\nI never want to feel like that again. So, the next day I come back and I push through it.\n\nI'm now lifting weight that is hundreds of pounds more than he was. Whenever I look in the mirror and I see a muscle, it's something that I earned. Each time I fail, I know I'm going to lift that weight up next time.\n\nI am glad that now I can see what strong is compared to what I used to think strong was; strong is facing your demons. Strong is holding yourself accountable to acknowledging what's going on inside. I have learned to open up and tell people, \"Hey, I'm not doing good,\" or \"Hey, I need to talk.\"  \n\nBefore, I painted over the red flags, I ignored gut feelings. I was weak-minded because I wanted affection. He saw that and took advantage of it. But I saw that opportunity to get up and run, and I took it.\n\nI will never forget what it takes to be strong.  \nWe Need to Talk About It\n\nThere are way too many people who can relate to what I've been through, and that feels bittersweet. It's good to feel like I'm not alone, but if someone can relate to me, it's because they've been through it, too.\n\nI'm not saying every girl who lifts experienced abuse—I just hope people will realize what girls like me have been through and start to see things differently. Don't criticize a girl for being muscular, ask why she feels like she needs to get stronger in the first place.  \n\nWe need to acknowledge the percentage of girls who go into lifting weights—and fitness in general—because they were abused physically, emotionally, and sexually. I am in a sport that's filled with these types of people, and yet we don't really talk about it.  \n\nIt would be great to see more support from the bodybuilding community. I'm going to make it a point that every time I compete, my bikini has purple incorporated in it. That's the color that represents victims of abuse, and I want to stand on that stage and show exactly why I'm there and how I got into this sport.\n\nIf I can shed more light on this issue, then the world that so many of us live in won't be so dark. The more attention you put on something, the more attention it will get. I want to get to a point where it's no longer the norm to be quiet.\n\nI would rather have an uncomfortable conversation than just sit back and allow people to be ignorant about what's really going on. This horrible thing happened to me and it's OK to talk about it. If I hide from it, it's like saying I lost.  \n\nI'm bringing it to the surface so everyone can see how far I've come and what I'm able to do in spite of what happened. That is strength.  \nIt's About More Than Just Building Your Body\n\nI started out just wanting to get out and prove him wrong. But now I look at my before and afters and it's amazing. I wish I could tell each and every person what that feels like.\n\nIt doesn't matter if all you do is lift the 5-pound weights and do cardio if that's your thing. As long as you're leaving the gym feeling good, happy, and like you've achieved something, then you did it. You're doing exactly what the person over there lifting 200-pound dumbbells is doing. You're building strength in your own way.\n\nI'm stronger than I've ever been. I want to work hard and compete and better myself and inspire those around me. I love this sport. I love knowing that we are all trying to get stronger—mentally, physically, emotionally—and we're doing it with a similar mindset and together in the same environment. It may not be for the same reasons, but we all have the same goal.\n\nWe all want to get stronger; we all want to get better.

        "articleBody": "Police in Norwood shot a woman in a parking lot Friday afternoon after she allegedly pointed a gun multiple times at her head and at officers and then approached officers while pointing the weapon at them, according to police Chief William Brooks.\n\nt a news briefing, Brooks told reporters that someone at a storage business on Morse Street called 911 shortly before 1 p.m. and said the woman had pointed a gun at him during a dispute, according to video posted by WCVB-TV.\n\nShe was flown to a Boston hospital with a gunshot wound to her midsection, Brooks said. Her condition wasn’t immediately available Friday evening.\n\nBrooks said responding officers negotiated with the woman for about 45 minutes and that she repeatedly pointed the gun at her own head and at police, according to the video. Police opened fire when she moved closer to the officers while pointing the gun at them, Brooks said.\n\n“Initially she was holding the weapon to her head, and then she began to walk around the parking lot, and on several occasions walk towards the officers,” Brooks said at the afternoon press conference.\n\nHe said that officers gave her verbal commands to move back.\n\n“They clearly did not want to fire,” Brooks said. “They held off firing. It would have been justified if they had fired much earlier than they did, but they very much did not want to fire on her [and] kept trying to deescalate the situation [and] calm her down.”\n\nThe woman was still alive as of 5:50 p.m., David Traub, press officer and director of communications for the Norfolk district attorney’s office, said in an email.\n\n“State Police from our office joined the investigation,” Traub said.\n\nTrooper Brandon Doherty, a spokesman for the State Police, said in an email that Norfolk County State Police detective unit, crime scene services section, and ballistics assisted at the scene.\n\n“Norwood PD requested MSP assistance regarding a shooting in their jurisdiction,” Doherty said.\n\nThe woman’s name wasn’t disclosed.",

        "articleBody": "If you stepped outside on Friday, you definitely noticed it felt cold. Temperatures were in the mid-30s in Greater Boston as the sun was getting ready to set on the weekend before Christmas.\n\nWe have gained about four minutes of daylight on the back end of the day since Dec. 9. This of course is just the beginning of growing light in the coming months.\n\nIt’s going to be dry and seasonably cold through the rest of the weekend, with one minor exception — possibly late Saturday night. At that time, a weak weather system will bring a few rain and snow showers west of Boston.\n\nSome of these could possibly hold together as they move eastward. I think it’s unlikely there will be enough precipitation for any salt or sand to be needed inside Route 495, but there is a small possibility that in the hilly terrain of Worcester County and maybe Franklin County a few of the crews will have to go out early Sunday morning.\n\nWe obviously know that this is not going to be a white Christmas in most of New England. Snow this time of the year is not without precedent, but the ground is more often void of the white stuff as opposed to being able to build a snowman.\n\nI was curious what the most amount of snow has been on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, so I took a look at the two-day snowfall totals on record. The last time we had a really significant snowstorm was back in 1961 when 10 inches fell Christmas Eve into Christmas Day.\n\nThis year, Christmas Eve (Sunday) will feature a lot of clouds and some glimpses of sun with temperatures getting into the lower 40s. As we transition to Christmas itself, it will be partly sunny and seasonably mild with readings generally in the 40s during the afternoon. Roads will be dry and the weather will not be a factor in traveling.\n\nLooking further out, a warming trend resumes with temperatures possibly getting into the 50s by the middle of next week along with potential rainfall. The details on how that storm evolves still need to be determined, but what I don’t see is any snow.\n\nLooking into the first week of January, we need to use multiple model forecasts, called the “ensembles,” to get an idea of the upcoming pattern. The snowfall for the ensembles of the GFS is quite limited through that first week of the new year. This doesn’t mean that we couldn’t still see a big snowstorm as it’s a 16-day forecast, however the trend as of now is just not conducive to snow and cold.\n\nFinally, it’s worth noting on this first full day of astronomical winter that the cold season is our fastest warming one. Since the 1970s, temperatures have really changed across the country but here in the Northeast we have seen the most amount of warming. This is one of the reasons why as you sit around with your family talking about Christmas past you may indeed remember them as a lot colder and you would be correct.",

        "authors": "Noah Sheidlower",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A core measure of inflation closely followed by the Federal Reserve fell month-over-month for November.\n    At the same time, a measure of how Americans feel about the economy jumped nearly 14% in November from the previous month.\n    Americans are still spending and feeling better about the economy. The vibecession is over.\n\nThe so-called \"vibecession\" may be over, as Americans start to feel better about an improving economy.\n\nOn Friday, the Commerce Department reported the personal consumption expenditures price index fell 0.1% in November from the previous month, the first decline since April 2020. It's up 2.6% year-over-year and is a sign the US can continue controlling inflation while avoiding a recession.\n\nThe core PCE index, which is another measure of the same report but excludes food and energy prices that are more volatile, increased 0.1% in November from October — and up 3.2% compared to last November.\n\nThe PCE is the Federal Reserve's favorite gauge for inflation, which it watches closely in an attempt to bring inflation down to its 2% target. Over the last six months, the PCE measured 1.9% on an annual basis, below the target.\n\nDoes this mean the war on inflation is over, and the US might avoid a recession and instead stick a \"soft-landing?\"\n\nMany economists predict that to be the case and that the Fed will hit its inflation target without unemployment rates drastically rising.\n\nAfter all, consumer spending continued to rise in November as well, suggesting Americans are still eager to spend around the holiday season, even with credit card debt at all-time highs and student-loan payments impacting over 43 million Americans.\n\nConsumer expenditures for last month rose 0.2% from the month prior, while income increased 0.4%. Americans are increasingly willing to dish out money on services, which increased 0.2%. The price of goods, many of which have experienced disinflation over the last few months, fell 0.7%, while food prices decreased 0.1%.\n\nAnd job growth remains strong, as this year, the economy added an average of 232,200 new jobs each month. The unemployment rate has lingered between 3% and 4% since early 2022. Additionally, the share of prime-age workers with a job or on the job hunt is at 83.3%, which is about the highest percentage since 2002.\n\nAll of this is finally making Americans see that the economy is doing well.\n\nThe University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment increased 13.7% month-over-month in December — and 16.6% over the last 12 months, driven by a surge in expected business conditions. This spike brought consumer confidence levels back to July levels, though sentiment is still well below pre-pandemic levels. The report noted that sentiment improved across age, education, geography, income, and political identification.\n\nThe \"vibecession,\" the disconnect between how the economy is doing and how people think the economy is doing, might be shrinking. All this suggests the Fed may be on target for the first of its projected three interest rate cuts in early 2024. The Fed has kept the benchmark overnight borrowing rate at a target rate of between 5.25%-5.5% since last raising rates in July.\n\n\"Disinflation is in the data now, and that is wildly positive for the economy and the market,\" wrote Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. \"The Federal Reserve is very likely to begin cutting rates in March.\"",

        "authors": "Anneta Konstantinides",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "I love testing Ina Garten's recipes, and I made over a dozen new ones this year. \n    I was a huge fan of her breakfast dishes, including scrambled eggs cacio e pepe. \n    Garten's Greek orzo salad and outrageous brownies were also among my favorites. \n\nIna Garten is my favorite celebrity chef, and every year I set out to learn new dishes from her extensive repertoire.\n\nIn 2023, I dove through \"Go-To Dinners,\" her most recent cookbook, and explored some of her earliest recipes.\n\nWhile I loved almost everything I tried — like her weeknight pasta and watermelon cosmo — these are the five dishes I know I'll be making again and again in 2024.\n\nIna Garten's scrambled eggs cacio e pepe became an instant favorite. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Garten's breakfast recipes and pasta dishes, so I was excited when I found out she had combined the two in her \"Go-To Dinners\" cookbook.\n\n\"Eggs are always my go-to breakfast for dinner because they're substantial without being heavy, but I like to dress them up, like adding spicy Italian pecorino cheese and pepper,\" Garten writes in the recipe description. \"Just take your time with the cooking and you'll serve the most delicious scrambled eggs ever.\"\n\nThe recipe only requires four main ingredients: eggs, whole milk, unsalted butter, and freshly grated Italian pecorino cheese. How easy is that?\n\nGarten's scrambled eggs cacio e pepe look stunning in the pan and taste deliciously cheesy and creamy. \n\nAs someone who frequently eats scrambled eggs for dinner, this recipe felt like it was made for me. The extra hit of salt and cheese from the pecorino helped elevate the eggs, and the texture tasted silky and satisfying.\n\nIf you're eating Garten's scrambled eggs cacio e pepe for breakfast, I recommend pairing them with a fruity jam to help cut through the salt and add a bit of sweetness to your morning.\n\nGarten's banana sour cream pancakes have become a brunch favorite. \n\nI found Garten's recipe for banana sour cream pancakes in her \"Family Style\" cookbook.\n\n\"I spent a full weekend testing pancake recipes, but they all tasted pretty much the same to me: good, but not exciting,\" Garten writes in the description. \"Finally, I made these with sour cream, bananas, and vanilla and — served with bananas and maple syrup — they were a hit.\"\n\nGarten's husband Jeffrey — whom she's been married to for 55 years — is also a huge fan of these pancakes, which include lemon zest, butter, vanilla extract, and sugar.\n\nGarten's banana sour cream pancakes are delightfully sweet and so easy to whip up.\n\nPancakes aren't usually my go-to brunch order, but Garten's recipe really won me over. The sour cream helped plump up the pancakes, which tasted fluffy and buttery. The slight tang added more depth to the overall flavor, and the pancakes were very moist.\n\nPlus, aren't these golden pancakes just gorgeous? This is sure to impress your family, friends, or that special someone when you're making breakfast on the weekend.\n\nI'll be making Garten's blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake for every Mother's Day. \n\nGarten shared the recipe for her blueberry-ricotta breakfast cake — which also appears in \"Go-To Dinners\" — on Instagram in honor of Mother's Day earlier this year.\n\n\"Let mom sleep in while you bake her my Blueberry Ricotta Breakfast Cake. It's so easy to make — and who wouldn't love cake for breakfast?!!!\" Garten wrote in the post.\n\nThe recipe features fresh blueberries, whole-milk ricotta cheese, sour cream, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and powdered sugar.\n\nGarten's blueberry-ricotta cake is light enough for breakfast and impressive enough for dessert. \n\nMy mom gave Garten's recipe a 10/10, and it's easy to see why. The golden cake looks really impressive, and the flavor is so delicious.\n\nThe ricotta and sour cream both add tons of moisture, and I loved the slight sweetness from the blueberries. It's a light dessert everyone will enjoy, especially in the spring and summer months.\n\nGarten's Greek orzo salad was so good that it impressed my Greek parents.\n\nMy parents have taught me how to make a number of delicious Greek dishes (including pastitsio and baklava), so I was excited to show them this Greek orzo salad recipe from \"Go-To Dinners.\"\n\nThe dish features orzo, canned chickpeas, baby arugula, Greek feta cheese, red bell pepper, red onion, Kalamata olives, capers, dill, and freshly squeezed lemon juice.\n\nGarten's Greek orzo salad was my biggest repeat dish of 2023. \n\nMy whole family was a huge fan of Garten's Greek orzo salad, and we all made it multiple times this year. My mom loved the recipe so much that she even declared, \"Ina must've been Greek in one of her previous lives.\"\n\nThe recipe highlights all the best flavors of Mediterranean cuisine, with the orzo slick with rich olive oil soaking up the salty feta, briny olives, and burst of lemon juice. I made dozens of dishes this year, but Garten's Greek orzo salad was easily one of my favorites.\n\nGarten's outrageous brownies were the best Barefoot Contessa dessert I made this year. \n\nI've made several of Garten's delicious desserts (I've even ranked them!), but I usually try her cakes. One Sunday night, I wanted to make something a bit easier, so I decided to whip up her brownies instead.\n\nGarten's outrageous brownies appear in her first cookbook, \"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,\" which featured recipes that Garten made at her Barefoot Contessa store in the Hamptons before she became a celebrity chef.\n\nGarten writes in the recipe description that her outrageous brownies were the most popular dish at the store, and she sold \"like a thousand\" a week.\n\nThe recipe features semisweet chocolate chips, bitter chocolate, walnuts, instant-coffee granules, and pure vanilla extract.\n\nGarten's outrageous brownies are deliciously rich and decadent.\n\nChocolate lovers will rejoice with Garten's delectable brownies, which are jam-packed with chocolate chips. These delicious brownies couldn't have been easier to make, and I loved the fudgy texture and the crunch from the walnuts.\n\nThese brownies instantly satisfied my sugar cravings and were a huge hit with my family and friends. I know I'll be making them over and over again in the new year.",

Took my first bath with it today, and boy, does it work. I did not rate whether it’s easy to remove or clean, as I haven’t done those yet, but I don’t see why either would be an issue. If you’re an avid bath-taker like I am (baths are needed sometimes to warm up during our cold Wisconsin winters) and are tired of the water level going down as quickly as you’re trying to fill it, I definitely recommend this. My only complaint is that I should’ve bought the sooner… I’ve spent years and years using strips of old rags, sponge materials, etc. to try to keep the water from seeping out (which results in smelly, moldy material), but this works like a charm.\" —HeartStar14\n\nGet it on Amazon for $9.99 (available in nine colors).\n\n\n4.

Talk about saving my natural hair and not messing up my hairstyle. I love this cap and will be purchasing more. It's a game-changer. I wished I would have seen it sooner. Plus, it keeps my head warm. Others say it big, but it's ok cause it slouches and when I go to the salon and get my hair curled I throw it on. I live in Minnesota, so the weather does a number on our type of hair. That satin lined hat keeps my head warm and my style tight.\" —hlc1976\n\nGet it from Amazon for $23.99 (available in four colors).\n\n5.

They are SUPER comfortable! I walked an average of 13,000 steps per day for 20 days on them for my Europe winter trip and my feet and back never hurt! They are warm enough for a 25-degree weather with the right socks. I haven't had the chance to try them in rain yet, but they are supposed to be water-resistant.

Not anymore, this mattress pad is a game changer! Turning the mattress pad on before getting in bed makes all the difference in the world; no more freezing cold sheets. The dual controls are great since I like my side warmer than my husband does his side. The controls are easy to work and see in the dark. The mattress pad is soft and comfortable; you cannot feel the wires at all. It has nice deep pockets that fit on our mattress and memory foam pad very nicely. You will need two outlets to plug into in order for the separate controls to work. One year later…we still love this mattress pad!\" —Linda Stranzl\n\nGet it from Amazon for $69.95+ (available in twin, full, queen, and king sizes).\n\n10.

You'll feel more relaxed and ready to take on whatever the day has in store for you.\n\nThis can be programmed with seven different light settings, seven different calming \"wake up\" noises, and to start gradually lighting up at 30, 20, or 10 minutes before you wake. \n\nPromising review: \"I got this recommendation from TikTok and it really has helped especially with Oregon winters where the sun is not out by the time the alarm rings.

A door draft stopper reviewers swear is a great way to stop cold air from getting into your home during the winter months. You'll feel cozier when you actually get to feel all the heat you're pumping into it.\n\nPlus, not only will you save money on your energy bill, but you'll also stop tiny critters from crawling their way into your home.\n\nPromising review: \"The circulation in our house had a constant breeze coming in from below our back door. This product took about 10 minutes to install (cut to size, removal/replacement of our door stopper), and we have no more cold air blowing in from outside! The magic of the product is its rigidity. It is hard enough to block the strong draft we have, but it's soft enough to bend over our rug. If the stopper were very hard, it would push away the rug or force the rug to roll up or buckle. For us, this product is a perfect solution to our draft issue.\" —Wuzaaap\n\nGet it from Amazon for $7.99 (available in four colors).\n\n\n13. Or a weatherproofing strip you can place all around the door if you feel cold air coming in from all the small spaces. Plus, it also works at blocking out surrounding noise, like when the plow shows up at 4 a.m. with a \"beep beep beep\". \n\nApplying this during extreme weather temperatures can make the adhesive not stick as well, so it's recommended to apply it when it's between 55–104 degrees F. If you do want to apply it when it's between 45–54 degrees F, you can use a hair dryer to warm the tap and surface for better application.\n\nPromising review: \"So, I bought a house last year in the summer, whoot whoot! I live in Minnesota so baby, the winter was coming! My house is older and big, so I kept feeling drafts but couldn't figure out why. And then I discovered, the space around my front door needed to be sealed. I bought this and voila! Once I sealed my door, I was able to turn my heat down a bit and be comfortable in my front room! This was an inexpensive and quick fix. I have a ton of the stripping left by the way.\" —Myshia Moore\n\nGet it from Amazon for $8.97 (available in two sizes and four colors).\n\n14. A \"Purse Gummy,\" which you stick to the strap of your bag so that dang thing doesn't slip off your shoulder, which always seems to happen when you're wearing a big puffy coat. It's a small thing that can be really annoying when you're out running errands and bend down to tie your shoe. UGH!\n\nPurse Gummy is a small business that created this product to solve an annoying problem.\n\nPromising review: \"I recently bought a high-quality leather shoulder strap handbag and was having problems with it sliding off my shoulder, since the leather strap was fairly smooth. So I went online and searched to see if there were any products out there that would solve this issue...and I found the Purse Gummy! It works beautifully! No more struggling with a slipping strap. It is hardly noticeable on the strap since it is on the underside, but I wouldn't mind it if was seen because it works so well.\" —D. Dillon\n\nGet a six-pack from Amazon for $13.95 (available in three colors).\n\n\n15. Solaroil, a nail and cuticle oil designed to strengthen your nails with daily use. If you deal with soft or even cracked nails in the winter season, this will be your go-to. Just massage it on at night, and you'll wake up with stronger nails that won't break at a moment's notice.\n\nPromising review: \"I found this on TikTok, and I’m so pleased with the results. My nails are getting stronger and growing. And the best of all, not chipping. Love it.\" —sidna saavedra\n\nGet a .25 fl oz bottle from Amazon for $9.90 (also available in two other sizes).\n\n16. A small space heater designed to keep you warm and toasty without having to heat up the rest of the house. It has three heat settings as well as a fan-only mode to keep you the perfect temperature *and* save money on your electric bill. Reviewers confirm this thing is small but packs a big punch!\n\nPromising review: \"I bought this heater to stay warm while working from home this winter and to avoid high heating costs. So far we’ve already had a few chilly mornings and this little heater has worked great! Heats up my small office space quickly. It’s not exactly quiet, but as long as I am not in the phone I do not find the sound distracting. Hoping this will keep me warm throughout the winter!\" —Taylor Gobeil\n\nGet it from Amazon for $23.99.\n\n17. And an auto-shutoff outlet to give you peace of mind that you won't leave your space heater on for any longer than you need it, thus saving you even more money. Plus, you can use it to ensure your curling iron or straightener is turned off after you leave home during the other seasons.\n\nThat can't be a fear just I have, right? Right??? You can set the timer on this for one, two, four, or eight hours, or just put it on hold.\n\nPromising review: \"I plug a small electric heater into it. It allows me to get heat for a while...and turns the heat off when I forget I left it on. It should save me a few bucks over the course of a Maine cold winter!\" —Maine Guy\n\nGet it from Amazon for $11.79.\n\n18. A pair of semi-sheer rip-resist tights you may think are pretty expensive, but when you start to add up all the pairs of tights you've had to buy every year because you keep snagging them almost immediately after putting them on, you'll realize that this price is well worth it.\n\nPromising review: \"This is the first time that I have bought from this company. I was very impressed with how the nylons are holding up. Usually, I end up snagging and getting runs all the time. They are super soft and very comfortable. I love the way they look and feel. I’m very thankful for finding the site and finally being able to get nylons that work for me!\" —TERESE E.\n\nGet a pair from Sheertex for $59 (available in women's sizes XS-3XL). \n\n19. A pair of beaded fan pull extenders to make it incredibly easy for you to know which chain is for the light and which is for the fan. This way, you won't accidentally turn on the fan when your home is already frigid enough.\n\nPromising review: \"This is the definition of 'product you didn't know you needed because you didn't know it existed.' I was FOREVER pulling the wrong chain on our bedroom ceiling fan. (Want the light off? Oh no...now the fan's on high. Need to change the fan speed? Eek... now you're in the dark.) They're a much better quality than I expected. They're actually quite heavy-duty pull chains, and they add a bit of fun to the decor. (When you notice them — most of the time, who even things about a ceiling fan pull chain?) As an added bonus, my infant daughter loves staring at them while I change her diaper or jammies. I tap them to make the chains swing, and it's instant fascination, which helps make my job easier!\" —LHD\n\nGet it from Amazon for $5.88+ (available in five styles). \n\n20. A rechargeable lighter so you can light candles in seconds with a simple switch. Then when it runs out, you simply have to charge it instead of going out to buy a new one.\n\nPromising review: \"We've bought several of these, and they work better than expected and are so much more efficient than the disposable butane lighters. They're easy to charge and light candles almost as fast as butane, but last many times longer.\" —Seussbd\n\nGet it from Amazon for $7.22+ (available in 12 colors and three packs of two).\n\n21. A faux-shearling moto jacket here to solve the dilemma of what to wear when you wanna feel stylish but it's cold outside. Reviewers confirm this jacket is surprisingly warm — so much so that one person felt comfortable in -5 degree weather in it, meaning this will be your go-to through winter.\n\nPromising review: \"This jacket is amazing. It looks expensive. It is extremely comfortable and warm, yet not too hot. Seriously, I wore it in 60-degree weather and was not too hot. I wore it in -5-degree weather, yes that’s right, and I was comfortable. I wore it in my house, and I didn’t overheat. There’s something about the material. The lining does not shed or flatten. It’s thick and spongey like real shearling. It doesn’t really attract lint or hair or anything either. I just can’t say enough about this.\" —Huesitos\n\nGet it from Amazon for $69.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and 10 colors).\n\n22. Some weather-sealing tape you can use on your doors *and* windows to keep the cold out and your heat in. It's super flexible, which means it will work for any area, no matter the shape.\n\nPromising review: \"This stuff goes on really well and has almost a rubbery consistency that allows it to bridge gaps — not buckle or crease — and stretch a bit where needed. Some tapes look like packing tape, crinkly and cloudy, but this went on flat and clear and stayed that way. I put it on in October, and it kept the cold out and actually helped prevent condensation on the storm window through the winter (down to -25 degrees F). I removed it the next summer and it left no residue and it did not pull up the varnish on the window casement. Pictures are after it had been on for eight months. The 30 feet of tape covered three windows for me. I'll buy again.\" —Mercer W\n\nGet it from Amazon for $7.05.\n\n23. A natural sweater pill remover made from upcycled car windshield glass that'll remove any pills from your well-loved sweaters and sweatshirts that you're not ready to part with quite yet.\n\nCelsious is a Black woman-owned and environmentally focused laundromat *and* online shop based in Brooklyn.\n\nBuzzFeed Shopping Editor Maitland Quitmeyer says: \"Like many of you, I've been living in sweats and PJs during this almost-year of WFH full time. And it's made me revisit the state of some of my loungewear. Take for example, this college sweatshirt I wear all the time — as evidenced by the rather EXTENSIVE pilling all over it. So when I saw this pumice-esque sweater stone (it's made from upcycled car windshield glass — how cool is that?!), I decided it was worth the try. We've featured electric pill removers (mostly the fan-favorite Conair one) many times, and they really work. But sometimes you're looking for a little more detail or control — that's where this stone comes in handy.\n\nI was able to navigate around the contours of the logo on my sweatshirt with ease, removing pills using the corner or the entire flat bottom in a few quick strokes. It truly took no time at all — the sweatshirt was done in mere minutes. The only thing I would note is that particles do \"fall out\" of the stone, so do your pill-removing on a surface that's easy to sweep or vacuum up at the end.\"\n\nGet it from Celsious for $9.75 (originally $13).\n\n24. A boot tray you can keep by your door so you have a place to slip off your wet and snowy boots after coming inside. This way, all that water won't make it's way onto your floor and carpet. Because nobody wants that.\n\nPromising review: \"Great to hold wet winter shoes at your doors! I use them for putting my wet snowy shoes on when I come in my house from outside in the snow. The lip around the edges keeps the water from getting on my carpets and hardwood floors. I love these, and after the snow melts, I just pour the water into sink. Works great!! So easy to clean.\" —mimiofmixedblessings\n\nGet it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in two styles).\n\n25. A mug warmer that regulates the temperature of your coffee or tea so you can nurse your drink for hours without it becoming an ice-cold beverage.\n\nPromising review: \"I love this mug warmer. Has an on/off switch with a light so that you know it's on. Heats up fast. Keeps coffee hot until the last drop. I wish I had bought one sooner.\" —Stella\n\nGet it from Amazon for $14.99.\n\n26. A fleece ponytail hat designed with a drop-down ear warmer for some extra protection from the cold cold wind. It also has a hole so you can keep your hair up and off your face but still keep your head warm.\n\nPromising review: \"I gave one to my sister as a gift, and she wore it for a week straight, even indoors. She raved about it, so I bought one for myself. It has made my winter running so much nicer by keeping my ears warm as part of an insulated baseball cap. I need the visor for bright days. I use the slat for my pony tail. It’s a snug fit, so if you require large sized hats, it may not be comfortable, even though it fits using an elastic rim. Can’t believe I waited this long to own one!\" —HL\n\nGet it from Amazon for $38 (available in seven colors and also five packs of two). \n\n27. Sorel winter boots worth the investment because there's no reason to mess around when it comes to winter. Reviewers who live in super cold climates (we're talking Minnesota) rave about how these boots keep their feet warm, even in super cold temperatures.\n\nFYI, if you have Amazon Prime you can try before you buy!\n\nPromising review: \"These boots were comfortable the first day. They kept my feet warm, which my other cheaper boots didn't, even with wool socks on. With these boots, I only wore one pair of normal socks, and I had no cold toes! These are well worth the money!!\" —Amazon Customer\n\nGet them from Amazon for $128.31+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and in four colors). \n\n28. A cool mist humidifier that left more than 67,100 reviewers raving about how good it is at adding moisture to dry winter air. If you deal with dry and itchy skin this time of year, this little thing will be your savior at reviving your skin and making it feel hydrated. Plus, it can also help reduce congestion when you're sick!\n\nPromising reviews: \"I’m used to having extremely dry skin in the colder months so I try to have a humidifier on when I get out of the shower, or just have a very dry day. This humidifier is amazing! I feel so much more comfortable in my space with the air not sucking the moisture out of my skin! You notice the moisture right away upon turning it on! It’s easy to use, you can’t even hear it on, and easy to clean and refill! Thank you for giving me a less crusty winter season!\" —Taylor B.\n\nGet it from Amazon for $29.97+ (available in two sizes).\n\n29. And a humidifier tank cleaner designed to keep your humidifier free of mildew and mold for up to 30 days. It also kills 99% of odor-causing bacteria, which will keep any bad odors from arising with the steam.\nPromising reviews: \"I LOVE these little fish. I’ve been using them for about 2.5 years now, and I truly believe they help keep the humidifier and water cleaner. People don’t realize all the nasty mold and bacteria that can be growing in their humidifier and then released into the air in their room! I’ve noticed a huge difference in mold growth when I use these fish.\" —Shelly\n\nGet it from Amazon for $5.28.\n\n30. A faux fur hooded puffer jacket to take you to the top of a mountain — or just to a grocery store on Sunday, which is its own type of mountain.\n\nPromising review: \"I contemplated getting this jacket for quite some time, as I live in Wisconsin and haven't had a reliable winter jacket for a few years. I don't regret this purchase AT ALL — in fact, I'm obsessed with this jacket. The jacket covers my butt and fits nicely. It is made of excellent material, the fur on the hood is awesome (and removable) and SUPER warm.\" —Page\n\nGet it from Amazon for $99.99 (available in women's sizes XXS-3X and in eight colors).\n\n31. A K-beauty snail mucin essence here to help repair and rejuvenate your skin that takes a beating in the cold weather. This cult-favorite product has more than 49,700 5-star ratings with reviewers raving about how it helps reduce dullness and soothe dehydrated skin, even for people with oily skin.\n\nPromising review: \"This stuff is incredible. I have suffered from minor acne for almost two years and I finally realized the products I was using were far too harsh for my dry, sensitive skin. After using gentle products and eventually moving onto K beauty, I found this to lighten all the scarring from the years of picking at my breakouts. My scarring is still a bit noticeable but it was gotten tremendously better thanks to this product and this product alone.\" —Marc\n\nGet it from Amazon for $14.50.\n\n32. A windshield cover designed to protect your car from both ice and snow so you can leave in the morning and not have to spend extra time clearing your windshield before you hit the road.\n\nPromising review: \"I love this product. I live in Minnesota, and this is great not only for snow but for protecting against frost, which we get six months a year, it seems. I wish I had it years ago. One thing on this product that I don't see on some others out there is that it covers your wipers extremely well, which is great!\" —Amazon Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.87.\n\n33. Jack Black lip balm for fast relief from chapped lips. Reviewers confirm this works and works well. Plus, it has SPF 25 because you should be protecting your skin from harmful rays, even in the winter.\n\nPromising review: \"So I have been a loyal EOS fan for quite some time but you constantly have to reapply and honestly my lips are still cracked. I found Jack Black balm from a TikTok video and it has been glorious. I keep reaching for it to reapply and I don't need it. It doesn't feel greasy on my lips but it is a bit sticky? Or waxy. Either way, I don't mind it at all, and it also smells pretty darn good.\" —Trisha\n\nGet it from Amazon for $10.\n\n34. A pair of plaid touchscreen gloves anyone would appreciate because when it comes to winter, there is no room to mess around. You'll feel warm *and* stylish when you wear these.\n\nTop It Off is a woman-owned small business creating stylish accessories.\n\nPromising review: \"Don’t hesitate to buy these for yourself or as a gift. They are beautifully crafted. The color choices are awesome. Definitely more of a fashion glove as they would get wet in snow… but they will certainly keep your hands warm.\" —Mary Vaughan\n\nGet them from Amazon for $19.99 (available in 19 colors).\n\n35. Or some touchscreen gloves to keep your fingers warm *and* give you the ability to send a quick text without exposing your fingers. Plus, these gloves are thin, so you can use them as a liner during more intense winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding where you need stronger protection.\n\nPromising review: \"I like these gloves because they are light and just warm enough for a run outside in the beginning of winter. I use them for playing soccer outside and the grip on them is a plus! I can also easily use my phone with them.\" —Mymy\n\nGet them from Amazon for $16.99 (available in unisex sizes S–L and in three colors).\n\n36.

Nobody will be able to tell the difference.\n\nPromising review: \"Must-have life hack! I saw someone get this off of TikTok, and I totally loved it. It does exactly what you’d want it to do. The shirt can unbutton if you need it to, it’s super easy to put on. I love that it gives the illusion I have a collared shirt under without the hassle of wearing an actual collared shirt!!\" —Danny\n\nGet it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in three colors and in round and pointed collars).\n\n38. Ugg ankle boots TikTok has caused to sell out several times, so I wouldn't be surprised if it happened again.

So comfortable. I wore them all day and my feet were so warm and happy. They are adorable but look a bit like slippers. I loved them so much I ordered another pair today.

        "title": "\"That’s Where It Hits Off-Limits\": Housekeepers Are Revealing The Things They'll Never Do After Years In The Industry",
        "authors": "Monica Torres",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "If you’ve ever tried to deep clean your house, you know that housecleaning is a profession that takes specialized knowledge, attention to detail and physical strength to tackle high or difficult spots.  \n\nIt’s also a profession that does not get enough respect for how hard it can be. A significant number of domestic workers in the U.S., including housecleaners, are paid “under the table” in informal arrangements, working without federal anti-discrimination and health and safety protections. And on TikTok, cleaners have been sharing some of the misconceptions about and boundaries they have around their work with hashtags like #thingsiwontdo #housecleaner. \n\nTo separate general fact from fiction, we grabbed a few of these videos and also turned to the experts and asked other housecleaners about what they won’t or wouldn’t do after years of experience in the field:\n\n1. Expect A Cleaner To Do A Pile Of Dishes Or Clean Up After A Pet \n\n“Cleaning litter boxes or cleaning up after pets who have accidents. I’ve had people expect that, and that is just something I can’t do. I’ve been in houses where you’re constantly stepping in urine and I just have to walk away from that type of situation. \n\n“When it comes to feces or anything, that’s where it hits off-limits. It’s not super common, but I have run into it where people think that is a thing, and I’m just saying, ‘That’s your pet, that’s your baby, I’ll leave that to you, and then I’ll take care of everything else for you.’\n\n“Dishes are a big one, too. I don’t mind at all doing them for clients who need them done once in a while. But there have been people who try to take advantage and they’ll leave you a huge pile of dishes and expect you to do them, which is time-consuming and not something normal housecleaners usually do. It’s more housekeeping instead of housecleaning.” –– Amber Elise, owner of Bubbles and Buckets in Otsego, Minnesota \n\n2. Hover In The House While A Housecleaner Is Working\n\n“I would not stay at home while they are cleaning. A lot of my clients think they need to stay at home and help me clean. This couldn’t be further from the truth, and it is very frustrating. Housecleaners do not need your help. I’ve said this until I am blue in the face. You hire us for a service, and most of us are very good at what we do, so get out of the way and let us do our jobs.\n\n“Most of us clean two, three houses a day and are on a tight schedule. Clients that want to help usually slow us down. I cannot clean the kitchen while you are trying to rearrange your Tupperware.\n\n“I understand the trust issue, and if you have a new cleaning crew come in, or if you can’t physically leave, by all means, stay at home. Just seclude yourself in one part of the house, like a bedroom, so they can clean the rest of the house. When it is time to clean that room, move on to another part of the house they have already done. Once you build trust with your cleaners, you can give them a key or stash it outside somewhere.\n\n “The best jobs that I go to are the ones where I know no one will be home. I can zip through the job while I crank my Beastie Boys Pandora. I can’t do that with my little old ladies at home.” — Sara San Angelo, The Cleaning Lady in Charleston, South Carolina \n\n3. Leave The Thermostat Cranked High, Regardless Of A Housecleaner’s Comfort\n\nHousecleaner Sharel Moore posted a TikTok saying clients should turn down the thermostat for housecleaners. “We’re HOT!!!” her caption said.\n\nA critic in the comments replied, “Their house, their temperature choice. You don’t have to work there.”\n\n“You are right!” Moore shot back in a reply. “Being my own boss I choose to work for people that treat me like a human! And not just hired help.” \n\n4. Befriend A Client\n\n“After being a housecleaner, the main thing that I would not do is cross the line from treating a client like friends or even family.\n\n“I have had some really bad experiences before that. Because they treated me like family or friends, they felt that they were entitled to certain benefits, almost as if my work was no longer valued the same because I had to give them a deal.\n\n“Also respect was no longer there, which led to several occasions where because those boundaries were crossed ... there was no clear line of ‘This is the list of things I do and no more,’ it was like ‘Can you also do ... ? Etc.’ The list can go on and on. I feel that it can be like this in many jobs, but I feel more so in a housecleaner situation as it is very personal as you are in their home.” — Ileana Cabrera, a Los Angeles-based housecleaner\n\n5. Have Blinds And Carpeted Stairs\n\nLisa Sosa of Clean Happy Company posted a TikTok explaining what she would not want in her own home after working as a professional cleaner for nine years:\n\n“I am not going to have blinds in my future home. Those things just collect dust and they are a pain in the ass to wipe, so I’m going either to have the Roman shades or no blinds at all, just really good curtains,” she said, adding later that carpeted stairs are her other big no-no because they are a “pain in the butt.” \n\n6. Use Chemical Or Strongly Scented Cleaners\n\n“I won’t use strongly scented cleaning products, even if they are marketed as natural, because they give me headaches for two or three days after the job.” —Gail, a New York City-based housecleaner and member of We Dream in Black, an initiative of the National Domestic Workers Alliance that centers the voices of Black, Afro-Latina and Afro-descendant domestic workers\n\n“After working as a housecleaner for so many years, the main thing I do not do anymore is use cleaners with chemicals in my own home. Many of my clients insists on using toxic cleaners in their homes and as I get older, I am getting very concerned about breathing all those chemicals in as well as them absorbing through my skin.\n\n“I now wear gloves at those clients’ houses if I use anything with bleach in it or other harsh ingredients, and make sure to use them in a ventilated area.\n\n“In my own home, I basically make my own cleaners using vinegar, baking soda and maybe a little Dawn dish detergent. You really don’t need cleaners that can take the chrome off a bumper to keep your house clean.” –– San Angelo \n7. Stay At A Privately Owned Vacation Rental Like Airbnb\n\nTiffany Williams, a Granger, Indiana-based housecleaner, said on TikTok that one of the biggest things she will not do after working as a housecleaner is to stay at a privately owned vacation rental, like an Airbnb. \n\n“I’ve been in a lot of Airbnbs over my sixteen years of doing this. I’ve seen a lot of neglected Airbnbs, I’ve seen a lot of mold in dishwashers, coated ceiling fans, vent fans barely functioning, gross stuff on walls, boogers on bed skirts,” Williams said. “I’ve seen it all, and I personally would never stay at a vacation rental.”\n\n8. Have Grout With Small Tiles In The Backsplash Of My Kitchen\n\nHousecleaner Alyssa, who works in the Oakland, California, and Macomb County, Michigan, area, shared that after working as a housecleaner, she would not have many small tiles with a lot of grout in her ideal kitchen backsplash, because of how hard they are to clean.\n\n“Grout is annoying, it requires maintenance, and it’s in your kitchen. It’s going to get a lot of buildup and grease,” Alyssa said, “I would opt for a slab ... There’s no grout and you could match it with your countertops. That’s what I would opt for.” \n\n9. Get Paid Unfairly\n\n“I won’t accept a job without agreeing on a minimum of five hours per cleaning and receiving a clear agreement of the client’s housecleaning needs in order to quote a fair hourly rate. I won’t work for less than $25 per hour.” –– Gail  \n\n10. Get Paid Later Instead Of Upfront  \n\n“I’ve had people say, ‘I get paid on Friday, so I’ll pay you on Friday.’ And that’s just not how it works. When your cleaner gets there, have the payment ready to go.\n\n“It baffles me because I know I wouldn’t be able to tell a cleaner, ‘Hey, I’ll pay you when I get paid in two weeks,’ and I’ve experienced that, and that’s not the way it works when you’re cleaning someone’s house. Especially when you are self-employed and you might need that money by the end of the week for a certain bill.” –– Elise \n\n11. Assume That Housecleaners Do Their Job Because They Have No Other Choice \n\n“If I were to ever hire a housecleaner I would 100% make sure I treat them with the utmost respect and never assume that they do not speak English or that they do not have an education.\n\n“I have a Bachelor of Science in applied mathematics and speak perfect English and if I am cleaning houses, it is not because I have no other choice. It is because it is my choice. I earn more now than I ever did working in any office job I ever had, but never had the flexibility I now have and need for my family.” — Cabrera\n\nSome answers were edited for clarity and length.",

        "articleBody": "Cheese deadline arrives without new deal between Canada and the United Kingdom\n\nThe grey weather outside Darren Larvin's window in Wiltshire, U.K., when he spoke to CBC News last Tuesday matched the forecast for his company's Canadian cheese sales in 2024.\n\n\"Essentially, we're going to fall off the edge of a cliff at the end of this year,\" said the managing director of Coombe Castle International, an award-winning global exporter of British dairy products like specialty creams, butters and cheeses.\n\nAfter Brexit — the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union in 2020 — an interim agreement kept tariff-free British cheese on Canadian shelves for three years, as government negotiators worked on a longer-term bilateral trade deal to replace the liberalized trade the U.K. enjoyed under the terms of Canada's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the EU.\n\nThose bilateral negotiations have yet to land. And in the meantime, both sides confirm their temporary cheese deal expires at the end of 2023. There's a risk British cheese imports are set to nosedive.\n\nAfter four decades of working with other top British cheesemakers to find openings for fancy U.K. cheddars in Canada's notoriously closed dairy market, Larvin admits to feeling \"pretty desperate.\" This change affects about one-third of his business. While British cheese shipments may not drop to zero, he's poised to lose a lot of Canadian shelf space. \n\nAccording to international trade data, the U.K. exported over two million kilograms of cheese to Canada in 2022 — and a massive slice of that are Coombe Castle products. Cheese is a seasonal commodity: trade data suggests Canadians love their party platters and holiday gift baskets at this time of year, with strong demand for the kind of specialty cheddars Coombe Castle ships — which includes Advent calendars and even a maple cheddar uniquely targeted at Canadian tastes.\n\nLarvin says his company worked with its Canadian partner to ship as much as it can to close out 2023. But once that stock sells through, jobs are at risk for not only his U.K. suppliers but also small businesses in Canada like the boutique shops that feature his products.\n\nCBC News reached Lisa MacNeil from Tree of Life, a Toronto company that partners with Coombe Castle to import British cheeses. She confirmed this change negatively impacts her business too, and said \"it didn't need to happen.\"\n\nOff the table'\n\nCanada's dairy industry believes the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU (and by extension, CETA) shouldn't become their problem to fix. \n\nIn the aftermath of the bruising renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised dairy farmers that no additional slices of Canada's domestic market will be served up to exporters in future negotiations.\n\n    Commons considers Bloc bill to end dairy concessions in trade deals\n\n\"For dairy farmers, a promise made is a promise kept and we expect the same from our government,\" former Dairy Farmers of Canada president Pierre Lampron wrote in a Dec. 1, 2022 letter, reminding the government that trade deals the Liberals implemented since coming into office have, by the dairy sector's calculations, already outsourced 18 per cent of Canada's market to foreign producers.\n\n\"The Canadian dairy industry must not be further penalized by the U.K.'s decision,\" Lampron said. \"New access to the Canadian dairy sector should remain off the negotiation table.\"\n\nA private member's bill currently in the Senate could also tie negotiators' hands and prohibit future trade treaties from conceding additional imports of supply-managed farm products like cheese.\nCompeting for a smaller share\n\nTo import cheese tariff-free, a business needs to hold tariff rate quota (TRQ) — permits assigned by the Canadian government for specific annual volumes, subject to specific criteria.\n\nGlobal Affairs publishes import data for specific categories of cheeses, according to the terms of Canadian trade treaties as well as World Trade Organization rules. In 2023, TRQ was allocated for up to:\n\n    16 million kg from the EU, under the auspices of CETA (plus an additional 1.7 million kg of European industrial cheeses, which are mass-produced, often used as an ingredient in further processing);  \n    3.6 million kg from the member countries of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes Pacific Rim dairy exporters like Australia and New Zealand (plus an additional eight million kg of industrial cheese and 2.9 million kg of mozzarella and prepared cheeses from the CPTPP bloc);\n    4.1 million kg under the auspices of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA, which updated NAFTA in 2020), (plus an additional 4.1 million kg of industrial cheeses from the U.S. or Mexico); \n    20.4 million kg to fulfil World Trade Organization obligations, of which:\n        14.3 million is reserved for EU members, and\n        6.1 million is available to all other countries.\n\nA side letter on cheese written to accompany the Canada–U.K. Trade Continuity Agreement in 2020 said that \"cheese originating in the United Kingdom shall continue to be eligible to be imported into Canada under the reserve for the European Union within Canada's WTO cheese TRQ until no later than Dec. 31, 2023.\"\n\nAfter that, companies like Coombe Castle must compete with exporters from other countries like Switzerland for space in the second, smaller WTO reserve for non-EU countries, which is already 96 per cent utilized.\n\nIn the meantime, French, German or Dutch cheese could fill the gaps British products leave on Canadian shelves. \"Something else will replace it, because retailers have to plan for the future,\" Larvin said. \"It's sad, really.\"\n\n\"We continue to talk to dairy farmers and producers about the potential changes at the end of the year, including ensuring that they have all the information they need to prepare,\" a spokesperson for the British High Commission said in a written statement to CBC News, adding that British cheese exports to Canada were up 11 per cent in 2023.\n\nImport permits controversial\n\nWhen the U.K.'s entry into the CPTPP takes effect — the text for Britain's accession was reached last summer, and earlier this month Japan became the first member of the Pacific Rim trading bloc to ratify its new membership — British cheese could compete for the TRQ available under that treaty.\n\nThat does little to ease Larvin's mind. \"There isn't enough cheese in CPTPP,\" he said, noting that the U.K. will be up against major dairy exporters like Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAnd based on his company's experience under CETA, Larvin fears the CPTPP may not be as helpful as advertised. \n\nThe CETA, CPTPP and CUSMA all allow Global Affairs to allocate import permits to Canadian dairy processors, instead of retailers or traditional importers.\n\n\"It creates almost like a black market for transferring quota,\" Larvin said. \"That's really not what the whole trade deal was about — it wasn't meant to become an opportunity for people to make money from trading quota between themselves and not have any interest in importing.\"\n\nThis process also drives up the costs for consumers, he said. \"CETA brought in people who were opportunists, and not really in it for the long haul.\"\n\nThe Canadian government intended the profits from dairy imports to serve as compensation to its domestic dairy industry for the market share it lost to foreign competitors.\n\nThat wasn't what treaty partners felt they'd bargained for. Canada's TRQ allocation process was challenged by both the U.S. and New Zealand in recent trade disputes, with mixed results.\n\nThe Dairy Processors Association of Canada said it wasn't in a position to comment on the expiration of Canada's side letter with the U.K. on cheese, saying CBC News' questions were outside the scope of their president's expertise.\n\nCould WTO quota previously allocated to the EU be re-assigned to the U.K., since the EU is smaller post-Brexit? CBC News asked \nGlobal Affairs Canada if it was considering such a reallocation.\n\n\"To date, Canada and the U.K. have not agreed to any new arrangement related to U.K. access to Canada's WTO cheese TRQ,\" said GAC spokesperson Jean-Pierre Godbout.\n\nCheese for beef trade-off\n\n\"I'm not saying the U.K. is not at fault for leaving the EU,\" Larvin said, \"but it would just be nice for us and our (importer) partner in Canada to have some comfort that we can continue trading while a sensible agreement is found for both parties.\"\n\nLarvin says he understands trade negotiations are difficult. He's written letters and travelled to both London and Ottawa to meet with officials and parliamentarians to explain what's at stake. Everyone likes his products, he said, but he's left with the impression negotiators have \"come to the end of the road\" for reasons that have nothing to do with cheese.\n\nWith bilateral negotiations scheduled to conclude in 2024, Canada and the U.K. have yet to harmonize their food safety standards to enable more Canadian meat exports.\n\nBeef and pork producers have been lobbying the Canadian government to hold back any new trade agreement with the U.K. until more of their products are accepted under British regulations. \n\nThe Dairy Farmers of Canada also said in their letter that they objected to the U.K.'s proposal to include a chapter on animal welfare standards, calling that a threat to Canada's sovereignty and an attempt by the British to dictate Canadian agricultural production standards.\n\nAlthough the text for the U.K.'s accession to the CPTPP was finalized last summer, International Trade Minister Mary Ng's office confirmed last week she has yet to even give the required 21-day notice to Parliament to begin Canada's ratification process.\n\nIt's an echo of the \"cheese for beef\" standoff that characterized the end game of the CETA talks a decade ago.\n\n\"It feels like we're a bit of a pawn in the whole game of trade negotiations,\" Larvin said.",

The segment usually ended in one of two ways, with Povich saying \"you are not the father,\" or \"you are the father.\"\n\nSiska the orangutan is four months old, but it was unclear if her father was 30-year-old Berani or 16-year-old Jaya, the zoo said on X. \n\nOn Monday, the zoo revealed they were settling the paternity debate. \"The DNA results are in, and we're delighted to share that we now know who Siska's father is,\" the zoo said in a post on X. \"Stay tuned tomorrow for this special announcement from an extra special guest.\"\n\nThat special guest was, of course, Povich, who recorded himself opening the results in a tux. \"Fresh off receiving the Daytime Emmys Lifetime Achievement Honor, Maury Povich is here to help us announce the paternity results for Siska, our four-month-old Sumatran orangutan,\" the zoo wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nLike he would on his own show, Povich amped up the drama as he opened a manilla envelope containing the results. \"This is really important,\" he said. \"When it comes to the orangutan – 4-month-old Siska – Bernai, You ARE the father.\" The zoo even mimicked the show by sharing a split screen of Berani and Jaya's photos and zoo staff cheering at the results, just like Povich's audience would. \n\nJust days before he lent his services to the zoo, Povich spoke on the Daytime Emmys red carpet about his legacy of delivering paternity test results. \"They're gonna remember, 'you are the father, you are not the father,'' he told Entertainment Tonight. \"That's what they're gonna remember.\"\n\nPovich, 84, was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the ceremony. His show \"Maury\" ended in 2022 after 31 years.\n\nHe told Entertainment Tonight people will ask him to say his iconic line when they meet him on the street. \"Well, I react very favorably because if you're on television every day and nobody recognizes you, you're in trouble,\" he said. \"I've always been very generous with my time in public because I believe in that.\"",

        "articleBody": "Two strong non-power conference contenders face off in the Armed Forces Bowl\n\nThe 2023 bowl season continues Saturday afternoon with an intriguing matchup between James Madison and Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth, Texas. Normally, James Madison wouldn't be eligible for the postseason given its recent move from the FCS to the FBS, but the Dukes made the cut since there weren't enough six-win teams to fill the spots ahead of them. \n\nJames Madison, which went 11-1 and didn't lose a single game in regulation, didn't get to play for the Sun Belt championship despite a victory vs. eventual champion Troy and a better conference record than East division winner Appalachian State. Ironically, App State is the only team to beat JMU this year, doing so in overtime on Nov. 18. \n\nAir Force looked like it was racing its way towards a potential Mountain West title and rocketed up the rankings with an 8-0 start to the season, but the Falcons completely imploded down the stretch. They lost their last four games in a row -- dropping two against teams that didn't qualify for a bowl in Army and Hawaii -- and fell out of the MWC race. The Falcons would love to regain their early-season form and send what was once a promising season out on a high note. \nHow to watch Armed Forces Bowl live\n\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 23 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Amon G. Carter Stadium -- Fort Worth, Texas\nTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nFor a limited time, new subscribers can save $20 on Fubo's Pro, Elite and Premier plans.\nJames Madison vs. Air Force: Need to know\n\nJames Madison under new leadership: Former James Madison coach Curt Cignetti was hired at Indiana after leading the Dukes to 19 wins in their first two years at the FBS level. He won't coach in the bowl game and his replacement, Bob Chesney from Holy Cross, won't be running the show in the Armed Forces Bowl, either. Damian Wroblewski, who joined James Madison's staff in 2018 as the offensive line coach and associate head coach for the offense, was named acting head coach following Cignetti's departure and will be on the sidelines for the Dukes.  \n\nDukes starting QB expected to play: Cignetti's departure isn't the only major change for James Madison. Longtime starting quarterback Jordan McCloud entered the transfer portal in early December but is expected to suit up for the game. McCloud threw for 3,400 yards and 32 touchdowns in 2023 while leading the Dukes to their 11-win season. However, James Madison has used four different quarterbacks this year and had a serious competition in the offseason, so it appears the spot may be open.  \n\nAir Force defense could be the difference: Air Force's defense is arguably the most impressive unit in this whole game. The Falcons finished sixth nationally in total defense while allowing just over 277 yards per game, and their 17.9 points surrendered per game ranks top 15 in the FBS. Air Force is led on the back end by safety Thorpe Award winner Trey Taylor, who logged 71 total tackles, 4.5 for a loss, three interceptions and four pass breakups in 2023.\nArmed Forces Bowl prediction, picks\n\nOdds via SportsLine consensus\n\nDespite James Madison's incredibly strong season and near-sterling résumé, it's hard to pick the Dukes with any confidence. They've seen way too much change with the loss of Cignetti to Indiana and McCloud entering the transfer portal. They aren't the only significant losses. James Madison has seen a starting offensive lineman, almost its entire starting defensive line, its top three linebackers and a starting quarterback leave the program. Air Force will be at mostly full strength, and while this game could down to the wire, the Falcons have a great shot at winning outright. Pick: Air Force +2.5\n\nWhich college football picks can you make with confidence during bowl season?

        "authors": "Associated Press",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "The Detroit Pistons were off to a promising start, a recent Coach of the Year leading a team that appeared full of hope.\n\nNow they are on the verge of matching the most hopeless teams in NBA history.\n\nThe Pistons have lost 25 straight games, needing a victory Saturday against the Brooklyn Nets to avoid equaling the longest losing streak within one season. They haven’t won in almost two months.\n\nThe 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers both dropped 26 in a row.\n\n“That’s history that nobody wants to be a part of,” guard Cade Cunningham said.\n\n“We’re trying to build something that’s sustainable. It’s not like we’re trying to just go out there and win one game. We want to win multiple games. But to be on the wrong side of history, I mean, nobody wants to be there, so that is definitely an extra edge that we have to have.”\n\nIt has been a rocket trip to rock bottom for the Pistons, who were a basket away from a 3-0 start in their first season under Monty Williams. They dropped their opener by one point at defending Eastern Conference champion Miami, then bounced back with consecutive victories.\n\nThe losing started on Oct. 30 and hasn’t stopped. Routed recently by the 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks, the Pistons had a chance to pull out a victory at home Thursday against a short-handed Utah Jazz team but committed 21 turnovers that led to 27 points in a 119-111 loss.\n\nWilliams, frustrated by the Pistons’ carelessness that he said has been a seasonlong problem, was asked afterward about his team’s mindset.\n\n“You can just about imagine,” he said. “You have these kinds of opportunities, you’ve lost 25 in a row, like, you’re probably not in a great mental state. But again, what choice do you have but to fight and compete and dig your way out of it? But it’s human nature to feel like you know what and that’s where we are.”\n\nThe Cavs team that dropped 26 in a row was reeling after LeBron James had departed for the Heat. The 76ers were early in their “Process” era, and winning was secondary to setting themselves up to earn high picks in future drafts.\n\nBut these Pistons are trying to win. Owner Tom Gores spent big to hire Williams, who took the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals in 2021 and was voted Coach of the Year the next season after leading the Suns to a franchise-best 64-18 record.\n\nCunningham, the No. 1 pick in 2021, was back after missing the final 70 games of the 2022-23 season with a stress fracture in his left leg to highlight a roster featuring five top-five picks in the last six drafts.\n\nMaybe they are just too young, unable to execute what Williams wants. He vows to keep trying, though.\n\n“We’ve got to show it, we’ve got to teach it, we’ve got to demand it, and it’s not going to change because we feel bad about it,” Williams said. “We’ve got to get to work.”\n\nPerhaps they can capitalize on a tired Nets team that will be playing the second night of a back-to-back after hosting reigning NBA champion Denver on Friday. The Pistons host the Nets on Tuesday in their next game.\n\nThe Nets had their taste of NBA misery, setting the record for most consecutive losses to start a season when they began 0-18 in 2009-10, one of their final seasons in New Jersey. The 76ers matched that in 2015-16 as part of their 28-straight losses over multiple seasons, the overall longest losing streak in league history.\n\nNow the Pistons are trying to escape NBA infamy.\n\n“This is the hardest time for all of us in basketball, by far,” Cunningham said.",

My wife recently decided to return to work after staying home with the kids as a full-time mom. She’s an elementary school teacher and has a male co-worker.\n\nFor six months, this co-worker has been texting her constantly, sometimes every day for several weeks at a time. Along with work-related texts, he asks for advice regarding his recent breakup with a longtime girlfriend. He has also been sending random texts late at night asking how she’s doing, and “checking in” messages.\n\nTwo weeks into summer break, he messaged her asking her how her summer was and telling her what’s going on in his life. I have confronted her about the borderline inappropriate texts he sends, and she assures me nothing is going on between them. She says she’s “handling” it by not responding to his texts but will not tell him to quit texting her.\n\nI have never met this guy, but feel I need to have a conversation with him explaining my concerns. Emotional affairs are real, especially in a workplace. Even though I trust her, I don’t trust him, and I feel disrespected. I understand they work together and need to communicate, but this feels wrong. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n-- Excessive in Michigan\n\nDear Excessive: I urge you to forget about confronting your wife’s co-worker. Try this instead: Tell your wife you want to meet and get to know this co-worker and suggest the three of you (or four, if he would like to bring a date) meet for a casual lunch or dinner. If you do, it will give you insight into what is going on. He may be quite a bit younger, trying to be friendly and asking for dating advice because he thinks of her as a mentor. I do NOT think this has anything to do with respect or lack of respect for you.\n\nPreviously\n\n    Dear Abby: My man’s ‘fishing pal’ turned out to be a catch he says he loves\n    Dear Abby: I need my husband to be a caretaker, not a crybaby\n    Dear Abby: Arrogant daughter who corrects Mom’s speech should be told to ‘knock it off’\n    Dear Abby: If I send birthday gifts to my niece’s new child, should I also send gifts to her two stepchildren?\n\nSee all “Dear Abby” columns\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Imagine if on the first Christmas, Mary and Joseph were like many of us.\n\nThe holidays come around, and some of us want everything to be … perfect. We want people to act right, or at least how we think they should behave. Some of us like to feel like we’re in control of most things in our life, and that’s tested this time of year. Schedules change. Routines are shattered. Strange relatives show up, old family messes bubble up.\n\nWelcome to Christmas.\n\nI thought about this when preparing my Christmas message to be given to the men at Akron’s Haven of Rest City Mission.\n\nSHE IS WHAT???\n\nJoseph and Mary were a traditional young Jewish couple. Their families came together to form an agreement for the young couple to be married. He was a carpenter. She was excited about being married to a guy with a decent family and a steady job.\n\nThen God showed up. So did problems.\n\nThat happens sometimes when God shows up and pulls us in a different direction – one where we have very little control of what comes next.\n\nBecause Mary became pregnant, there was pressure to call off the wedding. That was a big scandal in those times, because an engagement was a business deal between two families and announced in front of people of the village. It was a major community event.\n\nThere seemed to be very little special about Mary, except in God’s eyes. She was called to bring the Son of God into the world, as is recorded in Luke 1. It was a miraculous pregnancy.\n\nThe family and friends of Joseph probably told him to dump her. Under the law at the time, she even could be stoned. At the very least, she would be sent away from the village to have the baby elsewhere.\n\nInstead, Joseph listened to a dream where an angel told him to stick with Mary, that she indeed was told the truth about her pregnancy.\n\nWhat does this have to do with us? I know many people who find themselves in the same situation as Joseph, called upon to raise a child who is not their own biologically. Often, it happens suddenly, just as it happened in the Bible.\n\nTIME TO PAY TAXES\n\nAs Mary and Joseph worked through the pregnancy situation and decided to continue to be married, the Roman rulers called for a “census.” This actually was a demand for everyone go to the town of their family origin to register so they could pay taxes.\n\nMary was now very pregnant. They lived in a town called Nazareth. Joseph had to go to Bethlehem, the city of King David and his relatives.\n\nIt was 70 miles … walking … through the heat and rocks and snakes and dust and whatever else you find in the desert.\n\nThere are paintings of a pristine Mary riding serenely on a donkey led by Joseph. Maybe she was on a donkey, but that is not mentioned anywhere in the Bible. As for her moods, she was about ready to give birth.\n\nRemember, it’s 70 miles on foot over several days. Not exactly a Holly, Jolly Christmas in the making.\n\nBoth of them had to wonder, “Where is God in all this? This trip to sign up for taxes … I mean, TAXES? We’re talking about TAXES???”\n\nNO ROOM AT THE INN\n\nWhen they arrived at Bethlehem, the small town was packed with visitors there to register. Joseph knew his wife was close to delivering the baby.\n\nImagine how their moods were at the end of the trip, and they discover “There was no room for them in the inn (Luke 2:7).”\n\nEver been in a situation of caring for someone and it seems like no matter what you do … IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE!\n\nI studied the culture of the time and the place where Jesus was born and grew up. The circumstances and rumors about Mary’s pregnancy may have led to there being “no room at the inn.” There would have been a lot of Joseph’s relatives in town for the census. Some also may have lived there.\n\nIn Mary’s hometown of Nazareth was where a small group of Roman soldiers were stationed. Local women sometimes fell in with them. Other times, they were sexually assaulted. That could have been the source of some of the rumors about Mary.\n\nIt also could be why Mary and Joseph were rejected when looking for a place to stay.\n\nAll together now, everyone say: “Family Mess.”\n\nIsn’t it true that Family Mess often becomes an epidemic this time of year?\n\nBORN IN A BARN?\n\nNowhere in the Bible does it say Jesus was born in a barn. It does talk about Jesus being “wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger.”\n\nA manger is a trough used to feed animals. Some scholars believe Jesus was born in a cave, not a barn. That’s where some animals were housed at that time.\n\nHere’s what I think: WHO CARES?\n\nBarn? Cave? It ain’t the Ritz Carlton or even the Motel 6. No one kept the light on for them. If there’s a manger, there probably were animals around.\n\nAt this point, Mary and Joseph must have been thinking something like, “When will all this end? I thought God was in this.”\n\nWhen we are taking care of someone old or young … someone in need … and it seems like no one else cares, don’t we stare at the heavens (at least for a moment) pleading for help?”\n\nTHE WELCOMING COMMITTEE\n\nOn the hills outside of Bethlehem were shepherds, doing what shepherds still do – watching their sheep.\n\nLuke 2: 9-12: “An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger.’ \"\n\nThe shepherds mostly lived outside. They were not allowed in the main part of some temples because of their appearance and reputation.\n\nYet, God called them first to see Jesus. It’s symbolic of how Jesus came for everyone – born into a working-class family and welcomed by the shepherds, who knew about rejection in their own lives.\n\nBut Mary and Joseph had to look up and say, “God sent us shepherds?”\n\nThey probably would have preferred a visit from a wealthy relative.\n\nBut shepherds would have been comfortable in the barn/cave setting with animals. They would have been willing to help and not look down on the young couple.\n\nThose of us who have been pressed into caring for someone know there are times when aid comes from the most unlikely sources.\n\nJesus was born in Bethlehem to fulfill the Old Testament prophecy of Micah 5:2: “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.”\n\nTHE BIG POINT\n\nScholars and others will probably disagree with my account of the first Christmas. They love to fight over details and historical references.\n\nBut the heart of the story is more powerful than the often romantic versions found in media and books.\n\nJesus was born into a Jewish area occupied by the Roman army. His parents had to deal with rejection, rumors and at least some feelings that no one understood.\n\nTo bring Jesus into the world, they had to sacrifice a lot. Their journey was one that would have driven anyone with the slightest degree of being a control freak absolutely crazy.\n\nThey had to walk in faith and somehow trust God was in the middle of their suffering and frustrations.\n\nOne of my favorite lines is an old African-American Church saying: “When God shows up, it’s rarely early.”\n\nThat was very true of the first Christmas.",

Certainly, Rishi Sunak’s pledge to grow the economy is now severely in doubt,” he said.\n\nThat could put further pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates sooner than planned in a bid to shore up a weaker economy.\n\nBetter-than-expected data released Wednesday showed that inflation hit 3.9% in November, raising speculation that the central bank could cut rates in the spring.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has made growing the economy one of his key pledges this year. Downing Street said it will be met if GDP increases in the three months to December versus the previous quarter.\n\nA near-term drop in interest rates would be a win for Sunak’s government, as the U.K. enters an election year.\n\nStill, the BOE’s governor Andrew Bailey has insisted that rates may need to remain “higher for longer” after holding them steady at 5.25% at the final policy meeting of the year.",

        "authors": "Lucy Handley",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "When John and Barbara Dunning were informed that a freeway would be built through their farm in a remote part of the U.K., they saw an opportunity.\n\nThey built a rest stop with a difference.\n\nThe freeway (known in the U.K. as a motorway) was to cut through the Dunnings’ land in the region of Cumbria, a county known for its Lake District National Park, a striking mountainous landscape.\n\nAnd the Dunnings didn’t have much choice in the matter because the U.K. government issued them with a compulsory purchase order, meaning they had to sell their land for the road to be constructed.\n\nIt was the late 1960s and the Dunnings, then in their thirties, decided to put up a fight. They won their bid to lease back the land from the government and build and run a rest area — Tebay Services — that would be the first family-run motorway service stop in the U.K., and one that focused on providing local produce.\n\n“My dad had done a lot of research because everything was at stake, and they had to get it right,” the Dunnings’ daughter Sarah Dunning said of Tebay’s opening, speaking to CNBC by video call. “They couldn’t afford for it not to work,” she said.\n\nThe rest stop, on the northbound carriageway of the M6 motorway, started life in 1972 as a place for drivers to refuel their vehicles and themselves, serving homestyle food in a 30-seat cafe alongside a small craft shop selling local goods. The Dunnings went into business with family bakery Birketts, a partnership that lasted more than 30 years.\n\nNow, Tebay also has a rest area on the southbound carriageway, as well as a hotel and caravan park, and two shops that sell lamb and beef reared on the family’s farmland. It’s part of the Westmorland Family, a group run by Sarah Dunning, its chair, which operates two further rest areas — in the counties of Gloucestershire and Lanarkshire — as well as a community center with a cinema and cafe in Rheged, also in the Lake District.\n\nThe business employs around 1,200 people, has won numerous food awards and made revenue of £127 million ($162 million) in 2022, per its most recent annual report. In April 2022, King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales) visited Tebay Services farm shop to commemorate its 50th anniversary.\n\nMost motorway rest areas in the U.K. are populated by big-name outlets such as Burger King, Krispy Kreme and coffee chain Costa and are run by operators like Welcome Break or Moto, but Tebay and the company’s other locations take a novel approach, Sarah Dunning said.\n\n“We are a very different model to other motorway service areas. Where they partner with franchisors … popular brands that I suppose cover all customer needs, we don’t have any brands in our business,” she told CNBC.\n\n“We have a farm shop, and a kitchen … and we make our own food, kind of simple farmhouse food. And in our farm shops we see ourselves as a platform really, for small food producers,” she said.\n\nSarah Dunning became CEO of Westmorland Family in 2005, joining after roles at investment company Rothschild and as a headhunter in the City of London. The Birketts retired and sold their shares in the business back to the family and Sarah Dunning’s sister Jane Lane took over the management of the Dunning’s farm.\n\nSarah Dunning will speak at the Oxford Farming Conference, held from Jan. 3 to 5, 2024. “Farming is facing huge changes … there’s significant energy behind regenerative farming, but actually that probably isn’t going to be everybody’s model going forward,” she told CNBC.\n\nA new subsidy program has meant that some farmers in England have received lower payments than they did before Brexit, and three Environmental Land Management projects will provide incentives to farmers to regenerate land.\n\n“Everybody’s trying to navigate the changes in the subsidies and find a way that enables them to farm in the way they want to farm, but also profitably,” Sarah Dunning said.  \n\nShe is no stranger to challenges, having managed her family’s business during the global financial crisis of 2008 as the firm was raising money to build a rest area next to the M5 motorway in the southern county of Gloucestershire. “We couldn’t afford for it to go wrong … you go through these periods sometimes as a business and it’s your job to try and navigate through,” Sarah Dunning said.\n\nGloucester Services opened in 2014, selling food from more than 130 producers within 30 miles of the rest area and giving around £500,000 per year to local charities. In August, it was the subject of a six-part TV documentary show.\n\nSarah Dunning described the Covid-19 pandemic as having a “huge” impact on travel and hospitality firms, though the business has now exceeded its pre-pandemic turnover.\n\nHer next challenge? The rise of electric vehicles (EVs), which require charging points and access to enough electricity capacity. “Like all transformations, there’s a high degree of uncertainty around it, both in terms of how fast it’ll go but also how the technology will develop,” Sarah Dunning said.\n\n“Probably more than ever, electric vehicles will want to stop in locations that are pleasing to stop at, because you have to stop a little bit longer ... we hope that we can find ourselves in a strong position, because people like stopping with us,” she said.",

        "authors": "Oliver Darcy,",
        "date": "2023-12-07",
        "articleBody": "The American press is facing, arguably, the gravest potential threat to its freedom in a generation.\n\nThe four-time indicted, twice-impeached disgraced former president, Donald Trump, who admitted Tuesday that he will govern as a “dictator” on “day one” should he win office again, is overtly vowing to weaponize government and seek retribution against the news media, showing no regard for the First Amendment protections afforded to the Fourth Estate.\n\nThe alarming rhetoric against the nation’s journalists, whom Trump has consistently and insidiously referred to as the “enemy of the people,” has also been echoed by his top allies, indicating the promises of revenge are not the rantings of a madman, but the actual intended course of action should the Republican presidential frontrunner manage to seize power again.\n\nIn a particularly disturbing conversation this week, Trump’s former top political strategist, Steve Bannon, and former National Security Council adviser, Kash Patel, openly discussed plans to target the press. Bannon, who underscored that such promises are “not just rhetoric” and that they are “absolutely dead serious” about seeking revenge against journalists, asked Patel, who would likely serve in a second Trump administration, whether he could “deliver the goods.” Patel responded affirmatively, vowing that a re-empowered Trump would indeed “come after” the press.\n\nBannon did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday and a spokesperson for Patel claimed he was only referring to targeting journalists “who break the law.” Regardless, Trump has himself said he will target news organizations, including most recently lashing out at Comcast over NBCU News Group’s coverage of him, saying the company should be “investigated.”\n\n“I say up front, openly, and proudly, that when I WIN the Presidency of the United States, they and others of the LameStream Media will be thoroughly scrutinized for their knowingly dishonest and corrupt coverage of people, things, and events,” Trump declared in September, adding that he believes the press “should pay a big price” for supposedly hurting the country.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s campaign on Wednesday denounced the anti-press venom being injected into the public discourse by Trump and his allies.\n\n“Donald Trump and his cabal of snowflake henchmen are telling us what they will do if they get power. The plan apparently includes stomping on the bedrock principles of the First Amendment speech by locking up and punishing journalists for simply doing their jobs,” Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, told me in a statement. “The 2020 election and last year’s midterms made clear the American people will not accept these kinds of overt and existential attacks on our democracy.”\n\nBut the reality is that Trump could be elected again. And his appalling rhetoric adds even more evidence to the already mountain of examples that signal he aims to behave like an authoritarian, should he manage to secure the White House in 2024, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University who focuses on authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.\n\n“All autocrats consider the free press their enemy, and use legal harassment, imprisonment, and other methods to silence journalists,” Ben-Ghiat told me.\n“Trump, Patel, and others have already sued CNN and many other media outlets for defamation, and in doing so they are in line with authoritarians who use lawsuits to financially and psychologically exhaust journalists and media outlets.”\n\nBen-Ghiat added that such public threats “are also attempts to get media outlets to self-censor.” She stressed “autocratic media environments depend not only on the dissemination of talking points friendly to the leader, but also on silence about anything the autocrat does not want the public to know.”\n\nFloyd Abrams, the famed First Amendment attorney, told me that he believes “a second Trump term would gravely threaten freedom of the press” and outlined a number of potential actions that could be taken to retaliate against the news media. Abrams said a second Trump administration could bring potential Espionage Act cases against outlets over the publication of internal deliberations regarding government actions; repeal Department of Justice guidelines barring subpoenas to hunt leakers; and take anti-press positions in the U.S. Supreme Court, among other things.\n\nTed Boutrous, another First Amendment attorney, said the comments from Patel were “disgusting,” “fundamentally un-American,” and described actions “that seek to stick a dagger in the heart of the First Amendment.” But Boutrous stressed that the rhetoric on display for the public “should be taken seriously, given Mr. Trump’s and his staff’s egregious actions when Trump was in office.”\n\nPress freedom groups also spoke out on Wednesday against the anti-press fervor coursing through the MAGA-dominating wing of the Republican Party.\n\n“This kind of inflammatory rhetoric has no place in U.S. democracy,” Katherine Jacobsen, who heads U.S. affairs for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told me. “Thuggish threats to ‘come after’ members of the media in retaliation for their work covering elections is incredibly concerning, and creates a permission structure for violence against journalists.”",

        "articleBody": "Exclusive: Saw producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules tease where they are thinking of taking the saga next.\n\nAlthough Saw 11 is fast approaching, we still don’t know what the movie will entail Luckily, in a new interview with SFX magazine, the producers reveal they've got some big ideas that will tie up a few X-shaped loose ends. \n\n\"Cecilia is still alive,\" producer Oren Koules says to SFX in the new issue, which features Doctor Who's Ncuti Gatwa on the cover, \"and Tobin and Shawnee are in a foreign country still. So that, to me, would be the natural place to take at least the next one.\"\n\nIn Saw X, we saw a cancer-ridden John Kramer (AKA the Jigsaw Killer) travel to Mexico in search of a miracle cure promised by so-called doctor Cecilia. However, when he discovers that the procedure is fraudulent, he takes revenge on the con artists the only way he knows how. It would make sense to continue the story right where Saw X left off as Kramer’s work in Mexico isn't quite finished with his most evil opponent to date presumably still alive. \n\nIn terms of the franchise timeline, it may also be wise to set Saw 11 right after Saw X, which takes place between Saw and Saw 2, as Kramer actually dies in Saw 3, making it impossible for him to appear in any movie set after that time. However, since the cast has not yet been announced for the upcoming movie, Kramer, played by Tobin Bell, may not appear at all.\n\nIf Bell chooses not to return to the franchise again, could Saw 11 be the long-awaited sequel to the 2021 Saw spin-off Spiral? That seems unlikely as later in the interview, producer Mark Burg touched on the possibility of another Spiral movie. \"Maybe one day we’ll come back to doing a sequel,\" says Burg. \"Chris Rock would love to do one, but our focus, because of the success and the response to Saw X, is Saw 11.\" \n\nSaw X is available to rent on Prime Video. Saw 11 will be released in September 2024. For more, see our guide on how to watch the Saw movies in order, or check out our picks of the other best upcoming horror movies on the way in 2024. \n\nThe above is just a snippet from our interview with producers Burg and Koules, and director Kevin Greutert, available in the latest issue of SFX magazine, which features Doctor Who on the cover and is available on newsstands from Friday, December 29.

        "authors": "Emma Baty",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Burt Reynolds’s 1972 centerfold in Cosmopolitan was, simply put, a major moment in pop culture. It was our magazine’s—any magazine’s—first time featuring a man in that kind of spread, and it cemented Burt’s status as one of America’s sexiest men. In homage, we’re launching the Cosmo Centerfold series, in which we take cheeky pics (and ask cheeky questions) of the hottest celebs of our time. To get the printable, hang-on-your-wall version, you’ll have to pick up an actual Cosmo to see it in the flesh (sorry, had to). Enjoy!\n\nWhen I log onto Zoom to interview Anyone But You star Glen Powell, I'm greeted by the charmingly-unhinged Zoom name \"Glenjamin Button.\" This seems perfectly on brand for the 35-year-old actor, who spent the majority of our call oscillating between self-deprecating humor (he asked me what I was up to that night, and when I said I was mostly just chatting with him, he said \"I hope you have better plans after this!\") and thoughtful self-reflection.\n\nThis is actually the third time I've interviewed Glen. The first was March 4, 2020. We spent a lovely half hour talking about Top Gun: Maverick, only for the entire world to shut down a week later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost two years after that, we redid our phone call to coincide with the movie's release, but it was still before it had actually come out. It was a blissful moment where neither of us could have predicted how much of a mega, box-office-breaking hit it would be, and how much he would shoot to the top of everyone's \"I can't wait to see what he does next\" list. His life has changed drastically since then, and he's still adjusting to it all. (But you'll be happy to know he's still just as charming on the phone.)\n\nGood, I'll tell my colleague you said that. Who else are you dying to see do a romcom?\n\nI'm working with Daisy Edgar-Jones right now, who is hysterical. We're working on Twister together, and I joke that literally half of Twister is just me crying-laughing next to her in a truck, trying to compose myself for the camera. She would smoke a romcom. If any studios are reading this, give Daisy a romcom.\n\nOh, she'd be great. Pivoting slightly, how does it feel to get almost-naked for a photoshoot for Cosmo?\n\nI'm getting to this point where I've given the world a little too much skin in too short of a time. I really slutted out very quickly. I need to pump the brakes now. So you're gonna see me wearing a lot of turtlenecks this next year.\n\nIn Anyone But You, it's quite funny, because a lot of times I'll go into my trailer and the only piece of wardrobe is just a sock on a hook. That is my wardrobe for the day. You'll see a lot of me in the movie, and a lot of it for comedic effect. But ideally, when I go to the wardrobe department, I'm gonna ask for a little bit more cloth and material than I got on this one. \n\nYou're like, I need a full suit. Put me in as many sweaters as you can.\n\nCan I just get pants, please? I'm ready for a new phase of clothing. Because it's also nice to eat on set. On Anyone But You I was like, Okay, I gotta take off my shirt again tomorrow. No pasta tonight.\nFor all the casting directors reading this, let Glen eat pasta. Please.\n\nLike, a Glen Powell type, dough-y, out of shape, ready to eat, stands over a buffet. Let's start with that character intro. \n\nWhen do you feel the most sexy?\n\nOn a Sunday watching sports at my house with my friends, where I'm the host, cheering on a team that I love. When I'm getting to host other people and provide an experience, I think that's one of my strong suits. That gives me life and makes me feel a little bit sexy. My best attribute is is bringing people together.\n\nWhat is your version of a perfect date? Are you an activity guy? A dinner-out kind of guy, a movie date guy? Set the scene for me.\n\nI am usually an activity guy, and sometimes I take it too far. Like, I have a hobby of aviation. Whether it's helicopters or airplanes or skydiving or whatever it is, I can be a little too much. I'm actually trying to do a better job in this new phase in my life to go as simple as possible on a first date, because it's really just about the person. It's not about the fluff. It's not about the activity. I'm trying to go okay, what's the most stripped-away dinner situation in which you actually can get to know somebody.\nIt's also nice on a first date in particular to give someone fewer variables to contend with, so they can just be themselves.\n\nThat's exactly it. I try sometimes to just drop people in the middle of fun things and see what happens. But I know now the kind of partner that I'm going to be able to be teammates with going forward on this thing. And you're not going to find that with an activity. You're gonna find it by getting to know somebody's history and their heart.\nAnd eventually, hopefully, that person can do all the crazy, fun things with you. But at the start it's good to take it easy.\n\nYeah. And it's in those quiet moments where someone can feel the freedom to be themselves and talk about themselves that you'll get to know how they're going to navigate those crazy things. \n\nI've been a student of the entertainment business for a long time, but I've never really been a student of love in the business. I'm starting to look around and try to understand what makes love survive in this business. It's tough, and very few people make it work and even the people that you think it can work for, a lot of times, it still fails. I'm trying to have what my parents have.\nWhat have you discovered about making it work?\n\nI think it's going to come down to mutual respect, mutual trust, and having communication that navigates all the uncertainties. I can't even tell you how many random things would get put on my plate in a given day that would drive most girls up the wall. As I'm trying to go forward, I'm like, Okay, what is necessary and what's unnecessary? And how can I communicate with a partner so that everybody feels like they know the game? Because at the end of the day, Hollywood is a game. But you want to be respectful and hear out your partner. I'm still learning how to be a great teammate. I'm still getting my bearings with a lot of this stuff. \n\nThe learning is never-ending, in my opinion. What's the best advice you've ever gotten about love?\n\nThe best advice I've gotten about love is from my parents. They said to fall in love with somebody with a sense of humor. Life's inherently going to throw a lot of hard things at you and as long as you can laugh it off, you're gonna be fine.\n\nEspecially because life is so naturally funny. Life is ridiculous.\n\nThat's one of the best skills that my family has taught me, especially moving out to L.A. and pursuing a career in which people throw a lot of rocks at you and people are can be pretty mean. This thing is not meant for everybody, but the fact that I can have a sense of humor even when shit gets kind of crazy is honestly the best weapon I have in my my arsenal.\nWe're devastatingly close to the end of our time, but I'm going to wrap up with a question that's a bit less serious than the meaning of love. Fuck, marry, kill: a martini, a glass of wine, and a beer.\n\nYou gotta fuck the martini. It's a sexy drink. That's what it's begging for. I think you marry the glass of wine. I'm a big fan of of wine. Sharing a glass of wine with someone seems like a more serious thing. And the kill on the beer, trust me, that's what you do in Texas. You shotgun a beer. You \"killed\" the beer.\nI appreciate that twist. So in this scenario you get all of them, you didn't have to kill anything.\n\nExactly. You're really just getting drunk, at the end of the day. That's what we're doing. \n\nLuckily for all of us, he's using his newfound star power for good: to bring back the romcom. We got him to reflect on his love for the genre, why he hopes to be a little bit more clothed in his next project, and what his love life looks like now that he's, like, a famous person.\nStarting with a big existential question: how do you feel about the current state of the romcom?\n\nThe romcom has now mostly gone to the streamers, which is completely fine, but I think it's taken away from the cinematic theatrical part where we don't just buy this as comfort food. The romcoms you and I grew up on were actually great movies. I watched My Best Friend's Wedding the other day and it's so fun. It's things like that, where you're not just making a romcom because that's a genre that needs to fill out a piece of an algorithm, but putting care into into it.\n\nI mentioned to my Cosmo colleagues that I was interviewing you and my coworker wanted me to pass along: \"Not a question, but tell Glen the world will begin to heal when he does another romcom with Zoey Deutch.\" Would you care to respond?\n\nThe world will begin to heal. I love that level of pressure. I mean, trust me, I see Zoey regularly. I saw Zoey last weekend. There is no doubt that Zoey and I are trying to find out what that thing is. Zoey and I had a blast making that movie. Chemistry is not a problem with the two of us. So we're trying to figure that out. But hopefully the world is healing sooner rather than later. But we're on it.",

        "authors": "Alyse Whitney",
        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "Everything you need for a festive new twist on a potluck with your pals, from food columnist Alyse Whitney\n\nI' ve been dip obsessed since childhood, always preferring a snacky meal to a sit-down feast. But it wasn’t until 2017 that I officially became a Dip Queen. That holiday season, I wanted to host a party—something that combined the chosen-family spirit of Friendsgiving with my social circle’s love of dipping (heh) in and out of multiple events in one night. Thus, Dipmas, where everyone brings a little bit of everything (dips, dippers, drinks, vibes, you know) to the communal table, was born.\n\nEvery year since, Dipmas—also known as Dipmukkah because I am half Jewish and have a well-documented love for The O.C.—has gotten bigger and better, with new friends, new recipes, and plenty of memorable moments. Like that time my bestie Joel set off the smoke alarm after his pot holder fell into a bowl of molten dip he had in the oven. Or our ugly-sweater contest that featured the most horrifyingly hilarious embroidered toys you’ve ever seen. One year, we even crammed 36 people into my New York City studio apartment (a miracle, IYKYK).\n\nLast year, I moved Dipmas to my second home in the city, Gagopa Karaoke, where we sang holiday classics and early aughts emo jams while cheers-ing with cannoli dip. And this year, on the event’s sixth anniversary, I’m sharing some of its greatest hits straight from my upcoming cookbook Big Dip Energy (out April 16, 2024). Because all I want for Dipmas is youuuuu...to host your own!\n\nSay “Kimcheese!” Dip\n\nKimchi + cream cheese = a match made in heaven. Creamy, dreamy, and with a spicy, funky kimchi kick. If you’re spice-averse or have an older jar of kimchi in the back of the fridge, you can sauté it in a small skillet over medium heat with a tablespoon of neutral oil or butter until lightly caramelized.\n\nJust the Dip\n\n    1 (8-ounce) brick cream cheese, softened\n    1/2 cup Kewpie mayonnaise\n    1 cup kimchi, snipped into small pieces or rough-chopped\n    3 tablespoons kimchi brine\n    2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil\n    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n    4 scallions, trimmed and sliced thinly on the diagonal, a few sliced greens reserved for garnish\n\nChoose Your Dipper\n\n    Korean pickled daikon (the bright-yellow ones!)\n    Korean rice crackers\n    Tempura seaweed chips\n    Fritos Scoops! or another type of corn chip\n    Tortilla chips, especially Tostitos Scoops!\n    Crudite´s, such as carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, celery, broccoli, or sweet peppers\n    French fries, Tater Tots, or your favorite crispy potatoes\n\n1. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. (You can use kitchen shears to cut the kimchi directly into the dip so you don’t stain your hands or cutting board.) Transfer to a small serving bowl, and top with reserved scallions.\n\nSpanakopidip\n\nInspired by the Greek spinach-and-feta pastry, in dippable form. Highly recommend grabbing phyllo cups from the frozen aisle, baking ‘em up, and using them to scoop up dip or pre-filling them for easy, bite-sized party apps.\n\nJust the Dip\n\n    5 tablespoons olive oil\n    1 large yellow onion, rough-chopped\n    6 garlic cloves, rough-chopped\n    1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and water wrung out using a tea towel or paper towels\n    1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n    1 cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt\n    1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice\n    6 ounces feta in brine, crumbled\n    1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper\n    1 bunch scallions, white and green parts, trimmed and cut into thin diagonal slices\n    3 tablespoons rough-chopped fresh dill\n    2 tablespoons rough-chopped fresh parsley\n    2 tablespoons feta cheese brine\n\nChoose Your Dipper\n\n    Phyllo cups (in the frozen aisle)\n    Pita chips\n    Bagel chips\n    Crudite´s, such as carrots, cucumbers, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, or sweet peppers\n    French fries, Tater Tots, or your favorite crispy potatoes\n\n1. In a large saucepan or high-sided skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Saute´ the onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent and just starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add another tablespoon of the olive oil, then the spinach, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until warmed through and it picks up some of the onion and garlic flavors. Season the mixture with the kosher salt, but don’t be tempted to add more—the feta will make things perfectly salty.\n\n2. In a medium bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, crumbled feta, crushed red pepper, almost all the herbs (reserve a small handful of the dark-green parts of the scallions, dill, and parsley for garnish), feta brine, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir thoroughly.\n\n3. To make the hot dip version, add the creamy mixture to the spinach mixture in the saucepan, mix well, and heat on medium-low until warmed through, about 5 minutes. To make the cold dip version, add the spinach mixture to the creamy mixture, mix well, and enjoy at room temp or chill in the fridge before serving. Garnish either version with the reserved scallions, dill, and parsley.\n\nBuffalo Cranch\n\nWhat the heck is “Cranch”? Glad you asked. It’s an extra-creamy ranch dip made with cream cheese instead of sour cream. Omit the Buffalo sauce for classic Cranch, or try drizzling on some chili crisp for a different type of spicy.\n\nJust the Dip\n\n    1 (8-ounce) brick cream cheese, softened\n    1 cup mayonnaise\n    2 packets (1 ounce each) ranch seasoning mix (about 1/4 cup)\n    2 garlic cloves, grated\n    4 cranks black pepper\n    1 teaspoon sugar\n    2 tablespoons (or more) whole milk, for thinning\n    1/2 cup Buffalo sauce or cayenne pepper sauce (preferably Frank’s RedHot)\n\nChoose Your Dipper\n\n    Chicken nuggets or tenders\n    Fritos Scoops! or another type of corn chip\n    Tortilla chips, especially Tostitos Scoops!\n    Crudite´s, such as carrots, cucumbers, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, or sweet peppers\n    French fries, Tater Tots, or your favorite crispy potatoes\n\n1. Combine everything in a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer or your actual hands...holding a spatula...for an arm workout.\n \nHoly Cannoli Dip\n\nA less-sweet, slightly zesty (orange you glad?) dipssert that goes equally great with fruit, cookies, or…cannoli shells! Can’t find ‘em? Put a waffle cone in a resealable bag and let people crush their own cone chips.\n\nJust the Dip\n\n    1 container (15 ounces) whole-milk ricotta cheese\n    1 container (8 ounces) mascarpone cheese\n    1 cup powdered sugar\n    2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n    Zest and juice of 1/2 small orange (about 2 tablespoons juice)\n    3/4 cup mini chocolate chips\n    A hefty pinch of flaky sea salt, for garnish\n\nChoose Your Dipper\n\n    Cannoli shells\n    Waffle cones, broken into pieces\n    Pretzels or pretzel thins\n    Graham crackers\n    Pirouette cookies\n    Gluten-free crispy coconut rolls (such as Thai brands or Ava Organics)\n    Fresh fruit, such as apples, strawberries, or bananas\n\n1. In a medium bowl using an electric hand mixer (or a stand mixer with the whisk attachment), whip the ricotta, mascarpone, and powdered sugar together until fluffy and slightly thickened. Add the vanilla and orange juice and whip again if it looks thin. Stir in ½ cup of the chocolate chips.\n\n2. Transfer to a medium serving bowl, then top with the remaining 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and a hefty pinch of flaky sea salt. Other garnishes to play around with are chopped pistachios, peanut butter chips, or sprinkles (festive Hanukkah-inspired colored sprinkles are pictured here!). Let it sit at room temp for at least 30 minutes before serving.\nBefore You Dip In…Some Dip-ertaining Tips\n\nBefore you host your first Dipmas, here are some helpful #DipTips to prevent double dipping and make a stunning dipper spread.\nDip Etiquette\n\nOnly you can prevent double dipping. Here are four of my techniques to make sure no one commits the ultimate party foul.\n\nDip Front ’n’ Back: Drag your dipper forward in the bowl, then backward. Both sides of the bottom of the dipper will be coated in dip, which you can spread across the entire dipper or incorporate the dip ’n’ flip technique.\n\nDip ’n’ Flip: After taking a bite of a dipper coated in dip, flip it around so the uneaten side can be dipped separately. Make sure to really emphasize that flip so no one thinks you secretly double dipped!\n\nRip ’n’ Dip: This works best for crusty bread like baguettes, soft pretzels, and bagels. Rip off a small piece of the dipper of your choice to dip into the communal dish. \n\nDip ’n’ Snap: This works best with crudités. When you have a crunchy vegetable, you can dip then snap in half to have three more potential ends to dip in.\nFruit-and-Veggie Tales\n\nDippers are just as important as dips at Dipmas! Here are some ways to cut vegetables (crudités) and fruit (fruitités) for prime dippin’ time.\n\nApples: Cut into thick slices and sprinkle with any citrus juice so they don’t brown.\n\nBaby bell or sweet peppers: Halve lengthwise with the stem kept intact as a handle and scoop out the seeds.\n\nBananas: Using a just-ripe banana (aka yellow with maybe a few brown spots), cut on an extreme bias into long, approximately ¼-inch planks that resemble surfboards.\n\nBroccoli and cauliflower: Blanch by cooking for 2 minutes in boiling, salted water, then immediately shocking in a bowl of ice water. This keeps them looking vibrant and fresh and takes some of the raw edge off the flavor.\n\nCucumbers, carrots, and celery: Cut crosswise on the diagonal into dippable chunks or shave into ?-inch-thick ribbons using a mandoline or Y-peeler (plunge in ice water after so they curl up).\n\nLettuces: Any small-leaved, tender-yet-sturdy lettuce can work as a dipper. Just wash and separate leaves of Little Gem, Boston Bibb, Butterhead, endive, or the smallest inner parts of romaine and serve with chilled, not-too-heavy (light on the palate and not too chunky in texture) dips like Caesar Salad Dip.\n\nStrawberries: Halve lengthwise with the stem intact as a handle.",

Their strength amid the despair was profoundly moving and the resolve of this resilient and tough people reminds us that even in the darkest times, hope and goodness are ever-present.\n\n'As so many rise to help, heal, and rebuild, it’s a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity. Tonight and every night I pray for the safe return of all hostages and the healing of each victim and of their families,' she concluded. \n\nIvanka and Jared met residents who lived in the community up until the attack, The Jerusalem Post reported. \n\nA local named Chen Kotler told the couple that 64 people were murdered and 19 were kidnapped in the kibbutz, saying five are 'still hostages in captivity in Gaza.'\n\nShe reportedly gave Ivanka a dog tag inscribed with the words 'Kfar Aza is my home,' telling the former first daughter, 'Hopefully, one day, I can host you in my home.' \n\nThe couple also spoke with border police and IDF soldiers who helped save lives during the massacre, as well as members of ZAKA, a voluntary emergency response team. \n\n'Thank you for sharing your stories with us. I just have to say it's very humbling for me to be with you, with the heroic acts that you did,' Jared said during the visit. 'What you did had made a massive difference.' \n\nLater that evening, the couple met with President Herzog, First Lady Michal Herzog, and families of the hostages who remain in captivity.\n\nJared was dressed in a suit and tie, while Ivanka had on a black and white polka dot midi dress and black pumps. \n\nThe mother of three shared photos of herself with the Israeli president and kissing the Western Wall, which she and her family had visited earlier this year.\n\n'Praying for the safe return of all the hostages and the healing of each victim and their families #nothostagesleftbehind,' she wrote on her Instagram Stories. \n\nLocated in east Jerusalem, the Western Wall is a section of one of four original retaining walls King Herod built in the first century B.C. to support the Temple Mount.\n\nIt is also the only remaining portion of the Second Jewish Temple, which stood in Jerusalem until the Romans destroyed it in 70 A.D. \n\nIvanka, who was raised Christian, converted to Orthodox Judaism to marry Jared in 2009, and they are raising their three children in the same faith. \n\nJared also shared photos from the visit on Instagram, sharing a similar sentiment as his wife of 14 years.  \n\n'Ivanka and I traveled to Israel to bear witness. It’s important to see with one’s own eyes the lingering effects of the barbaric and unspeakable acts of October 7,' he wrote. \n\n'We met with families of those that were [kidnapped], including some still in Gaza. We met with several political leaders who are committed to building lasting solutions to intractable problems. With determination, trust, pragmatism, and creativity, the previously unthinkable can be accomplished.\n\n'We will pray that the coalition for peace, prosperity, respect, and understanding will prevail and create a bright and exciting future for humanity.'\n\nIvanka publicly quit politics in November 2022, saying she loved her father, former President Donald Trump, but would not be a part of his 2024 campaign.\n\nDonald Trump has also maintained that his oldest daughter and son-in-law would not be a part of his administration if he were to win a second term.\n\nThe couple traveled to Israel 'to show their support for its people' and the 'trip was in no way related to politics or former President Trump's re-election bid,' according to a source who spoke with the Wall Street Journal. \n\nPresident Herzog praised Ivanka and Jared on Instagram for 'standing by the State of Israel in these difficult days, for working for the immediate return of the hostages, and promoting peace in our region.'",

        "articleBody": "A seven-year-old boy killed in a hit-and-run just weeks before Christmas while playing football with his friends died of severe head injuries, an inquest was told.\n\nWilliam Brown was knocked down outside his seafront house in Sandgate near Folkestone, Kent around 5.35pm on December 6.\n\nAn inquest opening at Oakwood House in Maidstone today heard that shortly before his death William had been playing football in the front garden of his home with two friends.\n\nHis mother Laura Brown and her partner were in the kitchen of the property at the time.\n\nKatrina Hepburn, area coroner for Canterbury and South East Kent, said the football had been kicked over the wall at the end of the garden, which leads directly onto Sandgate Esplanade, the A259.\n\nShe told the inquest: 'Ordinarily the boys would've told an adult, who would've gone to retrieve the ball, or asked someone to throw it back over the wall. But on this occasion William decided to jump over the wall to get it back.\n\nThe inquest heard that Laura and her partner were told about the accident by one of William's friends, who ran into the kitchen shouting that he had been hit by a car.\n\nMs Hepburn said the seven-year-old's body was identified to the police by his mother at the scene.\n\nThe coroner gave William's cause of death as 1a) severe head injuries.\n\nShe added: 'William suffered catastrophic head injuries, and despite being worked on by the ambulance and air ambulance crews for over 45 minutes, he was pronounced dead at the scene.'\n\nMs Hepburn suspended the inquest pending criminal investigation - on the basis there is 'reasonable cause to suspect William has died in circumstances where an investigation is necessary'.\n\nWilliam's mum and his dad, Will Brown Snr, 34, did not attend the inquest opening.\n\nLaura, 41, previously paid tribute to her son. Speaking from her home on the day after his death, she said: 'William was the sweetest, kindest and funniest boy. He was an amazing friend to his friends.\n\n'He loved animals, history facts, nature and digging. He loved fossils and dinosaurs. Anything weird and wonderful.\n\n'He loved curiosities and oddities. He loved taxidermy. He had shark's teeth and spiders, snake skins. He was a very unusual boy.\n\n'For Christmas he wanted an octopus, so I got him a taxidermy one. He didn't get to see it, it's still wrapped. I'm going to put it in his coffin.\n\n'He was just always in Will's world. He was too kind for this world.\n\n'If there was a question to ask he had to ask it. He needed to know the answers to everything.'\n\nBeauty therapist Laura revealed that William, who 'loved football', had died in his beloved Cristiano Ronaldo kit after playing outside with friends.\n\nShe said: 'He supported Manchester United like his dad. But his favourite player of all time was Ronaldo. He died in his Ronaldo kit.'\n\nLaura said William's younger sister Pearl, aged six, is struggling to come to terms with his death.\n\nShe added: 'He's got a little sister who's six who just can't understand it. We were just about to have dinner and her dad told her \"Will's dead\".\n\n'She said 'I don't understand it, he's playing football in the garden.' She's devastated.\n\n'They were like twins. They were only 13 months apart. Will adored Pearl from the day she was born.'\n\nWill Snr, who is separated from Laura, added: 'Will was a really forgiving boy. He was accepting and loving and patient and kind.\n\n'I honestly think if he was here today, he would probably say \"I was just going to get the football dad, I just made a mistake\".'\n\nThe construction company owner said William, who was a year 3 pupil at St Eanswythe's Primary School, has 'left behind a huge network of friends, school friends, a huge family that loves him. All united because we love him'.\n\nHe added: 'I hope he's up there reading about how much we all love him.'\n\nAround 5.15pm on December 7, a local man was arrested in Dymchurch, Kent on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, causing death by careless driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision, and perverting the course of justice.\n\nThe 49-year-old was later bailed to return to the police station on 6 March 2024, pending further enquiries.",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "I play lots of games across every platform for work, but my most-played game in 2023 was one I primarily engaged with for personal enjoyment. While I sunk dozens and dozens of hours into games like Baldur’s Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fire Emblem Engage, Fortnite, Starfield, and more, my most played game was something that didn’t even come out in 2023.\n\nThat honor goes to Marvel Snap, a collectible card game from Second Dinner for PC and mobile\n\nPlaying it for extended periods daily, I racked up over 300 hours in Marvel Snap throughout 2023. It’s been a year of ups and downs for the deck-building game as it found its footing after a wildly successful launch in late 2022. Through everything, it has retained its core strengths, benefitted from transparent communications from its developers, and constantly added exciting new cards that shook up the meta. With all of that, Marvel Snap has become a comfort game I can play no matter the time or where I’m at.\n\n\n    My favorite game of 2023 is a secret Twitter eulogy\n    Our favorite PlayStation games of 2023: Spider-Man, Final Fantasy, and more\n    One year later, Marvel Snap is my favorite mobile game of all time\n\nKeeping me hooked\n\nThe core gameplay loop of Marvel Snap is just as captivating to me now as it was the first time I played it over a year-and-a-half ago. Matches are quick and exhilarating, removing much of the fluff that can lengthen or drag down other card games. It has also stayed fresh thanks to the variety of viable decks and random locations. The carrot of progression is continually dangled in front of me, as there’s always a daily or weekly mission for me to complete, a new card to collect, or boosters for me to earn.\n\nThese gameplay strengths were present when the game entered beta in May 2022 and still are. While the meta has evolved significantly over time, the core game experience has remained intact. Second Dinner has shown restraint when it comes to changing what works for Marvel Snap, and that has worked in the game’s favor because the game’s systems encourage experimenting with different decks.\n\nParticular standouts include a discard-focused deck centered around M.O.D.O.K. and Apocalypse, which I played a lot throughout the first half of the year, and a summoning deck where The Collector and Loki served as the backbone. Currently, I’m having a lot of fun trying to find which deck compositions work best with Blob, a card that absorbs and gains the power of every card left in my hand. Even if Second Dinner were to stop adding cards altogether, I still think I could continue to play the games for years, experimenting with corners of the meta I haven’t even explored yet even after hundreds of hours of play.\n\nThankfully, Second Dinner shows no signs of slowing down. A new card is added to the game almost every week, and we’re at the point where Second Dinner tests some truly off-the-wall ideas, like Blob. On top of that, a patch or over-the-air (OTA) hotfix comes almost every week to adjust game balance. Its feature set has also expanded, with new cards now being easier to obtain thanks to the Token Shop .Spotlight Caches and Conquest also provide a longer-lasting battle mode. The game is also on PC now, even though most of my playtime is still on mobile.\n\nSecond Dinner is underappreciated as one of the most transparent live-service developers working today, as it thoroughly explains every decision made in an OTA or patch and frequently responds to player questions on the official Discord. That’s not to say every update is flawless. Marvel Snap is ending the year on a somewhat lower note for me, as a December 2023 update added a flawed deck-builder system, a controversial change to America Chavez’s card, and some new bugs. I’ve also noticed that gold prices for new card variants have increased, with new emotes locked as albums of purchased variants.\n\nHeading into 2024, Second Dinner has some work to do in terms of balancing cards and making radical changes without much notice. I appreciate the constant communication the developers provide and how frequently Marvel Snap updates, though, and I hope it doubles down on this next year. Because Second Dinner is so transparent, I feel safe spending so much time (and some money) on the game, even with the troubles publisher Nuverse encountered this year.\n\nVery few live-service games click with me, and Marvel Snap addresses many issues that tend to disappoint me with these kinds of games. Its developers are readily transparent, updates are frequent, and progression systems give me a reason to play it not just every day, but multiple times within a day. Above all, Marvel Snap is a fun comfort game for me. It’s the only thing I could will myself to play after my dog passed away earlier this year, and it’s something I can play to de-stress or distract myself when life gets too hectic.\n\nA lot of games I play can feel like work, even if they’re fantastic. While I came to terms with that several years ago and don’t have many problems anymore, when a title like Marvel Snap connects with me on a deeper level, it nestles itself into my daily routine in a way few games can. That allowed Marvel Snap to come out on top as my most-played game in one of the industry’s most hectic years ever.",

        "articleBody": "We have the solution to Wordle on February 12, as well as some helpful hints to help you figure out the answer yourself, right here. We’ve placed the answer at the bottom of the page, so we don’t ruin the surprise before you’ve had a chance to work through the clues. So let’s dive in, starting with a reminder of yesterday’s answer.\n\nContents\n\n    Yesterday’s Wordle answer\n    Hints for today’s Wordle\n    Today’s Wordle answer\n    Tips for tomorrow’s Wordle\n\nYesterday’s Wordle answer\n\nLet’s start by first reminding ourselves of yesterday’s Wordle answer for those new to the game or who don’t play it daily, which was “NEVER.” So we can say that the Wordle answer today definitely isn’t that. Now, with that in mind, perhaps take another stab at it using one of these Wordle starting words and circle back if you have no luck.\n\nHints for today’s Wordle\n\nStill can’t figure it out? We have today’s Wordle answer right here, below. But first, one more thing: Let’s take a look at three hints that could help you find the solution, without giving it away, so there’s no need to feel guilty about keeping your streak alive — you put in some work, after all! Or just keep scrolling for the answer.\n\n    Today’s Wordle starts with the letter P.\n    Today’s Wordle uses the same vowel twice.\n    Today’s Wordle refers to a type of dough made from wheat flour, water, and sometimes eggs, which is typically shaped into various forms such as tubes, strands, or sheets, and then cooked by boiling or baking.\n\nToday’s Wordle answer\n\nNo luck? Don’t sweat it — you can’t get them all! If you just want to see today’s Wordle answer to continue your streak, you can find it below.\n\nThe answer to today’s Wordle is …\n\nPASTA\n\nToday’s Wordle definition\n\nAnd here’s what it means, according to our good friend ChatGPT:\n\n“Pasta” refers to a type of dough made from wheat flour, water, and sometimes eggs, which is typically shaped into various forms such as tubes, strands, or sheets, and then cooked by boiling or baking. It is a staple food in many cuisines around the world, with Italian cuisine being particularly renowned for its wide variety of pasta dishes. Pasta can be served with various sauces, meats, vegetables, and cheeses, making it a versatile and popular dish. Common types of pasta include spaghetti, penne, fettuccine, lasagna, and ravioli, among others.\n\nTips for tomorrow’s Wordle\n\nIt might seem like Wordle is all luck, but there are a few good practices you can use to help get as many clues as possible in just a few guesses, making it that much more likely you can figure out the final word before you run out of tries. The most important guess is your first, and the trick is to load up on vowels (A, E, I, O, and U).\n\nSome popular starting words people have had good luck with are “adieu,” “media,” “arise,” and “radio.” Just make sure not to pick a word with double letters, or you’re wasting precious guesses. The aim here is to try to figure out which vowels the mystery word contains, then layer in common consonants and close in from there.\n\nYour second word, assuming that the first one gave you a good jumping-off point, should begin to lean more heavily on common consonants like R, S, and T. More good ones here we’ve seen are “stern,” “irate,” and “atone.” You never want to reuse any letters from a prior round that showed up as gray — you know they aren’t in the word.\n\nNow that’s all solved and the definition is taken care of, and you’re armed with some tips to crush tomorrow’s Wordle, here are some games like Wordle you can try today.",

        "articleBody": "Visual artist Julia Bottoms’ new exhibition, A Light Under the Bushel, at the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York, is driven by her desire to explore Black images as celestial, royal beings, expanding the narrative around representations of Blackness. In “5 Questions with an Artist,” she shares the vision behind her paintings, her creative inspirations and her must-have treats while making her art.\n\nEBONY: What is your exhibition, A Light Under the Bushel, about? \n\nJulia Bottoms: This exhibition, which was curated by Tiffany Gaines, is really about imagining a history that was lost. I'm thinking about people of color and how during the creation of pieces that would be considered classical, we have always existed, we have always had contributions to offer. But when we think of portraiture, it's always been about who was worthy of being documented. And because we weren't considered people worthy of documenting, we don't see ourselves represented in these classical portraits. I wanted to imagine what that could look like if we were put in these really grand scenes, posed in religious iconography as saints and warriors and all those figures we're so familiar with in classical imagery. It’s how it might feel to see ourselves represented in that way.\n\nWhen did you first fall in love with art?\n\nI can think back to being in Head Start and anytime I had a chance to get crayons and paper, I was always creating. Actually, at this show, my first-grade teacher—who I haven't seen in 20-something years—came in. She told me that when I was a little kid I made this really, really detailed drawing, and she could tell everything that was in it, and she knew even then I had a passion for art. So it's just been something that's always been with me. And I was really fortunate that my parents encouraged it. They always cultivated the love I had for art.\n\nDo you consider yourself an artist first, and then a person of color?\n\nI think so often the art world demands Black artists to create trauma-centric work dealing with slavery and things like that. And I think what we're seeing now is as people of color, we're pushing back and saying, “Maybe I want to create work about race, but maybe I want to create work about something else, maybe I want to explore abstract work.” We are finally seeing an opportunity to be able to just be artists and not necessarily have demands or an attachment to topics other people want to hear. It can really be about us just exploring our passion as artists.\n\nWhat do you need to have in your studio when you’re about to create art?\n\nCaffeine, for sure. I'm a big tea drinker, I don't do coffee. I really like London Fog tea, so I drink a lot of them. I also have to have some gummy snacks. In addition, I always have to go out and buy some new art supplies to experiment with, which I think has led to some really beautiful work. I'm never afraid to just take something, like a cool pen that kids might use, and play around with it and have fun. Actually, in this exhibition, there are some pieces that are on vinyl and acrylic. I think some of the coolest work comes out of just keeping a sense of playfulness as an artist and never being afraid to try something new.\n\nWho are some of your contemporary inspirations?\n\nKehinde Wiley is a huge inspiration. I also look at a lot of local artists as well because there's something to be said for your peers and what they're doing. Being able to have direct access to working with them and seeing what they're producing at the moment is a great experience. So Markenzy Julius Cesar is somebody locally that I'm just like, “Oh, wow, such beautiful work.” George Hughes is another local artist. There are just so many here in Buffalo. I think a lot of people don't realize the wealth of talent that we have. I look at their work, and I'm blown away. It's world-class.",

It is unprecedented for a militia in a failed state, whose motto promises “Death to America, Death to Israel”, to have ballistic missiles capable of flying 2,000km and hitting tankers.\n\nAmerican, British and French warships have spent weeks shooting drones and missiles out of the sky: on December 16th they took down 15. Yet this defensive approach is hard to sustain. Surface-to-air missiles costing millions of dollars are being used against a blizzard of cheap Iranian drones. Only a handful need to get through and ships and their insurers will stay away.\n\nThat points to a three-step approach. First, a bigger international naval presence in the Middle East. On December 18th America announced a new task force to patrol the area. Ten mostly Western countries have signed up publicly; nine others, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are thought to be helping more discreetly. Others, including India, which depends on Suez and has ships in the area, should come aboard.\n\nAt least five American destroyers are now in the Red Sea. The uss Dwight Eisenhower, an aircraft-carrier, is poised off Djibouti, its four squadrons of strike aircraft within range of Houthi territory. Its destroyer escorts have some 600 missile-launch tubes between them. For now the task force will play defence. One option is to provide armed escorts for merchant ships, as America did in the Gulf in the 1980s during the so-called tanker wars. But over time this requires too many warships. The task force is more likely to establish a safe corridor, with an air-defence bubble against drones and missiles.\n\nThat points to the second step: diplomacy. Saudi Arabia is on the cusp of a deal to extend a ceasefire with the Houthis which could end a war that has devastated Yemen for nine years. It could include commitments to end naval attacks. That might suit America, which is keen to dampen down regional tensions. Its navy is stretched and its carriers are sorely needed in Asia.\n\nYet diplomacy may fail and the Houthis may not respect any deal: they will surely find it tempting to hold global trade to ransom again. That is why, third, America and its allies must retain the option of strikes on the Houthis. Though malign and reckless, Iran surely does not want an all-out regional war and may be persuaded to rein in its client. But it should understand that if it fails to do so, retaliation against the Houthis is inevitable.",

        "title": "Millions of Chinese are venturing to the beach for the first time",
        "authors": "",
        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "China’s beach culture is a microcosm of society \n\nA man with a giant tattoo of a carp jumping over a dragon is making a video of himself standing in the water, a green inflatable ring around his waist. As he films, waves move up the shore and catch the black flip-flops he has left on the sand. He grabs at one, but the water pulls the other out of reach. It is 7am and the competition is on, selfie versus shoe. The sandal floats out into the South China Sea.\n\nOn the shoreline nearby, several of the man’s high-school classmates are smoking. Two of them sport matching flowery swimming trunks that they have just bought for 45 yuan ($6). Last week the 18-year-olds drove six hours south to Shenzhen in southern China, a stone’s throw from Hong Kong.\n\nFortune-hunters from all over the country have tracked a similar path since 1978, when this rural backwater led the way in powering China’s growth. Today, however, the streets of China’s most prosperous city are no longer paved with gold. The economy is struggling. But the tattooed man and his blossom-shorted friends are a different kind of pioneer. Like millions of Chinese, they are making their first trip to the edge of their country—to sample the pleasures of the beach.\n\nMention of China’s coast is more likely to conjure visions of warships in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait than sandcastles. But the population’s growing enthusiasm for being beside the seaside also points to the changing relationship between state and society in China over the past 70 years. Tiny pockets of the country’s 18,000km shoreline were first domesticated some 150 years ago, mostly by foreign colonialists, just as European beaches were becoming destinations for pleasure rather than simply medicinal sea-bathing or “taking the air”. In the 1950s Mao Zedong rejected traditional imperial retreats for a summer getaway with top Communist officials at Beidaihe, near Beijing, once frequented by the British. It was from there that the Great Leap Forward was launched in 1958.\n\nFew Chinese had jobs as portable as party bosses, however. In the West the dawn of mass travel saw holidaymakers jetting off to sunny shores at a time when most Chinese were tied to the land or factory. Leaving the city became a punishment for intellectuals in the 1960s, not a sightseeing experience. Even after restrictions on movement eased in the 1980s, urbanites typically used their one annual holiday to return home.\n\nSince then domestic tourism has taken off, boosted by speedy transport links and rising disposable incomes. China’s beach culture was turbocharged by the pandemic, when socialising outdoors became desirable and those accustomed to overseas travel were forced to pursue their foreign-holiday practices at home. Even the party seemed to approve. When “Born to Fly”, China’s answer to “Top Gun”, was released in April 2023, it portrayed the fighter-pilot hero as a steely daredevil. The evidence? His love of surfing.\nThe little white look\n\nYi Wangxia—her name means sunset—came to the beach to feel the “force of nature”. The landscape is beautiful at Dameisha, “big plum sand”, says the 26-year-old, then leaps back as the water looms at her crisp white dress. She recently passed a basic swimming test for her maritime-management course but is afraid to go in the ocean. Nor will communing with nature involve eating seafood. Chinese officials have stoked fears about contaminated fish since August, when Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the nuclear plant destroyed by a tsunami 12 years ago.\n\nThose who do brave the water face little danger. Mao swam the Yangzi river in 1966 to demonstrate his physical and political prowess as he launched the Cultural Revolution. Decades on, however, the Chinese remain largely a nation of non-swimmers. Apart from a dedicated troupe of dawn swimmers, most who venture into the sea at Dameisha wear inflatable rings—even the adults—and stay in the shallows. A lifeguard smokes or shouts into a megaphone, less to save lives than to enforce the boundaries of a narrow rectangle of the water given over to swimming.\n\nEven more glaring is the absence of figure-hugging swimming costumes ubiquitous in the West. Some women wear suits with sleeves and skirts or long shorts. Others sport swimming dresses with reinforced bodices and knee-length skirts. A few enter the water fully clothed. In four days, only one Chinese woman was observed in a regular swimsuit—bright pink with frills—which she had bought for her first beach holiday in 2021.\n\nWives of Communist leaders at Beidaihe sometimes wore Western-style swimsuits. (Mao and Deng Xiaoping, his successor, were both photographed in trunks but Xi Jinping, China’s leader, eschews bare-chested beach shots.) It was in Shenzhen that the first bikini was worn in public in China in 1986, for an international bodybuilding contest, 40 years after the two-piece debuted in Paris. Why, then, the lack of swimsuits or bikinis today?\n\n“Being dark makes you look ugly and old,” says a 57-year-old Beijinger who wears her cap low and an spf face-covering across her cheeks. To many people pale skin is also a proxy for class, distinguishing toiling farmers from city-types who think their office work and service jobs make them refined. (Europeans held a similar view until the 1920s when a tan became a sign of having leisure time.) Beachside shops cater to such fears, selling cotton sheaths to pull over bare arms, umbrellas for shade, covid masks repurposed as face protectors, and “facekinis”—swimming masks that reveal only the eyes, nose and mouth.\n\nNo swimming and no sunbathing. Few picnics; despite an outbreak of “picnic fever” during the pandemic, most mealtime food in China is hot. Little booze and even less canoodling. Sure, some children dig holes and paddle. But at Dameisha a beach-volleyball net and giant swing are largely unused. So why does anyone bother to visit the seaside at all?\n\nMs Li’s antics provide a clue. She and her boyfriend of two years are not at Dameisha to swim (they cannot) or eat oysters (radiation). They wanted to go to the sea because their native Lanzhou in western China is so dry. But mainly because the beach is the perfect spot for photographs.\n\nIn a cream mesh dress and floaty veil Ms Li looks as though she is posing for her wedding photos. In fact, she and many others are dressed for the beach: the shoreline is one long photo shoot. Four women have set up a tripod to snap selfies, two in flowing red dresses, two in qifu, a form of Chinese dress, with right arms raised to look as if they are holding up the sea. A woman in her 20s had travelled several hours that morning wearing a purple wig and purple mouse ears to take photos holding an illuminated star with fairy lights draped around her short purple dungarees.\n\nIn the 1990s, when few Chinese had their own cameras, photographers with instant cameras would snap visitors at tourist sites. People wanted images not merely of an attraction or landscape, but of themselves in front of the setting. Those rare, precious Polaroids were the forerunners to the smartphone selfies posted online today; both are proof of an individual’s experience. And a new destination must be celebrated with a special outfit. One woman (dressed in ordinary clothes) has brought her cat, Luna, trussed up in a peaked cap with holes for her ears and a lilac bodysuit.\n\nFor centuries China’s imperial rulers viewed the country’s shorelines as a buffer against a barbarian world. At times they forbade people from living within 15-25km of it. Today the sands at Dameisha are dominated by giant winged sculptures, commissioned by the city government. Impressive facilities serve the day-tripper—large toilet blocks (which even boast soap, rare in Chinese bathrooms) and showers; the metro will soon connect the seaside to urban Shenzhen.\n\nLook closer, however, and the party’s presence is more insidious. Day-trippers are not the only ones taking photos. Entry gates capture an image of everyone who enters the beach; no state has more sophisticated face-recognition software than China. Tall towers stand every 120m up the beach with surveillance cameras pointing in all directions. Rather than encourage citizens to trust one another, a sign by a giant shoe rack reminds visitors that the cameras are watching.\n\nIn many ways this surveilled sandy fringe embodies the social contract that the Communist Party made with the Chinese people after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989: political loyalty in return for greater personal freedom and affluence.\n\nAnyone is free to come to the Chinese seaside, from the spotty 16-year-olds who dropped out of vocational college to the son of a tech worker who dashes in and out of the water, a giant grin revealing a gap where his front tooth came out at lunchtime while eating a spicy snack. (Or almost anyone—next to the free public beach is a private one, plus yacht club: “Shenzhen has many bosses,” says a staff member.)\nThe beach party\n\nEven under the party’s watchful gaze, there are signs that the social contract is beginning to fray. Political loyalty is no longer guaranteed. Few people mention Mr Xi’s name at the seaside but his policies are ripe for discussion. A construction worker came for a dip because he can no longer find work now the property sector is floundering. A 20-something is feeling the pain of urban youth unemployment: he sells fingers of bright pink, processed sausage for three yuan apiece, cooked on a hotplate mounted on his three-wheeled bicycle. Often he makes just 100 yuan a day. A beach cleaner abandoned life as a subsistence farmer four years ago and now works seven days a week, living in a dorm for 300 yuan a month, aged 50. “It’s tough, but what can you do?”\n\nNot everyone is getting richer or thinks that life is getting better\n\nNot everyone is getting richer or thinks that life is getting better. People still bemoan the long lockdowns in the late days of the government’s “zero-covid” policy. A woman whose tutoring firm had to shut when the government banned extra-curricular classes in 2021 is now applying for postgraduate degrees in Hong Kong—she wants a “better education” for her five-year-old. (Her husband, also a tutor, is trying his luck as an influencer-come-English teacher on Douyin, China’s TikTok.) A government worker from Inner Mongolia had to hand in her passport during the pandemic, as did most state employees, and must now apply to the authorities if she wants to go abroad.\n\nAs the light dims after 5pm, the state comes to the rescue again: bright floodlights flash on, extending the day’s joy. Even when it is wholly dark, children build castles and race toy diggers. A couple walks in the water, shin deep. A family unfolds a table and chairs to eat a kfc dinner. The social contract is safe—for now. And more brave folk step out into the South China Sea.",

        "articleBody": "Our celebration of the women we loved watching this year.\n\nWomen are the story, Jennifer Lopez says in ELLE’s annual celebration of Women in Hollywood. “We have to be able to stand in our own power and say, ‘We’re not just on the periphery.’” As Fantasia Barrino Taylor puts it, we must tell ourselves: “I am the award. I am the trophy.”\n\nLopez, Barrino Taylor, and the seven other honorees here are changing the face of the film industry—literally, by becoming the stars that they desperately wanted to see onscreen. “That’s what I signed up for as an actor—to be a reflection of the world that I actually live in, to represent the person who doesn’t feel she has a voice and who isn’t seen,” says Danielle Brooks. “Even to represent myself.”\n\nRepresentation has been a through line for many of this year’s Women in Hollywood honorees, from Eva Longoria, who talks about why she has made it a personal mission to tell complex Latin stories onscreen: “Hollywood gets to decide what heroes look like, and they never look like us,” to Lily Gladstone, who could become the first Native person nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her star turn in Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon: “Seeing yourself represented gives you a sense of your place in the world,” she says.\n\nNow that they’ve proven what is possible, they are pushing the limits even further. By writing new futures for themselves and women like them: “What I continue to wish for my career, and women’s careers and people of color’s careers, is that we don’t have to exist inside of these boxes or these lanes,” says America Ferrera, who will soon direct her first feature film. And by using their platforms to uplift others, like Taraji P. Henson, who says: “I’m grateful that acting led me to a larger life purpose.”\n\nGreta Lee, the breakout star of Past Lives, says she’ll work until age 100 if she can in order to make up for lost time—“all those years of sitting and just watching people who had access to all the opportunities you didn’t,” she says. While Jodie Foster, after five decades in the industry, is relishing the feeling of letting go and watching others soar: At a certain point, “it’s someone else’s time,” she says. “You might as well do more of the things you love, less of the things you hate, and stop beating yourself up for something you can’t control.”",

        "articleBody": "ELLE’s series Clothes of Our Lives decodes the sartorial choices made by powerful women, exploring how fashion can be used as a tool for communication. Below, in her own words, Olympic boxer and fashion model Ramla Ali shares the story behind her custom Off-White boxing robe—which she says gives her a confidence boost before a big fight. “When I first started in the sport, I wasn’t sure I deserved a robe,” Ali tells ELLE. “But after a while, I became more confident in myself and my abilities. I was like, ‘I’ve earned the right to wear this’”\n\nWalking into a boxing arena is a little like walking in a fashion show. You make a grand entrance. You don’t lock eyes with anyone. All you see is the ring, but everyone is looking at you. What you’re wearing sets the tone for the entire match. When you finally make it to the ring, the gloves go on.\n\n“Ding, ding, ding.”\n\nIt’s time to de-robe and showcase all of your hard work.\n\nIt’s game time.\n\nFemale boxing is getting televised a lot more than it used to, and there’s at least one female fight on every undercard—which is huge. But the sport is still on the rise. What a boxer wears helps her get noticed. You want people to know you for your boxing, of course, but you do need to set yourself apart outside of the ring.\n\nLast month at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, I needed to make a sartorial statement during my fight for my first professional title. With a venue that iconic, I wanted to collaborate with an equally iconic fashion brand. Working with Off-White felt like making history.\n\nI always say, “Wear something good makes you feel good, because when you feel good, you perform good.”\n\nI never felt better than I did wearing my custom blue and yellow robe from Off-White. The moment I put it on, everything changed. Everything became real. It was like: “Now it’s time for me to show everyone who I am, and what I’m fighting for.”\nboxing feb 04 ali vs mathie\n\nThe design process with Off-White was very collaborative. They sent options. I would say, “I really like this, but can we change this?” Or “Can we add this color?” I knew from the start that I wanted to incorporate a panther motif, whether it was on the robe, the shorts, the under-layer, wherever. A panther was a must. The animal has been synonymous with me ever since the start of my career. I am Somali, and on my country’s coat of arms there are two big cats. It was a way to blend my culture and my sport.\n\nOff-White sent a few color ideas, but a combination of yellow and blue stood out to me the most. It represents joy and happiness and power. We decided to incorporate the Spanish word “chingona,” which translates to “badass.” In the gym, all my coaches have started calling me chingona. It came out of nowhere, like, “Let’s go chingona!” Ever since then, they’ve called me that, because of how much I put into my training. The countless sparrings, the personal bests, and the endless training. I try to never complain.",

        "articleBody": "The 18-year-old hacked Rockstar Games from a hotel with a Fire TV stick, all while under police custody.\n\nA London judge has sentenced the teenage hacker who infiltrated Rockstar Games, leaking Grand Theft Auto VI footage, to an indefinite hospitalization, as reported by The BBC. The 18-year-old, Arion Kurtaj, breached Rockstar’s servers from a Travelodge hotel while under police custody, using only an Amazon Fire TV Stick, smartphone, keyboard and mouse. (He was promptly re-arrested.) Kurtaj was a central member of the Lasus$ international hacking group.\n\nDoctors declared Kurtaj unfit to stand trial because he has acute autism. Following the judgment, the jury was instructed to determine if he committed the alleged crimes, not whether he had criminal intent. Following a mental health assessment suggesting he “continued to express the intent to return to cybercrime,” the judge decided he remained too high a risk to the public. The court also heard accounts of Kurtaj’s allegedly violent behavior while in custody, including reports of injury and property damage. And so Kurtaj will now be committed to a hospital prison.\n\nDespite Rockstar's claim that the hack cost it $5 million and thousands of hours of staff time, Kurtaj’s attorneys argued the success of the GTA 6 trailer, which racked up 128 million views in its first four days, meant his hack didn’t cause serious harm.\n\nA second Lapsus$ member was found guilty in the same trial, but the 17-year-old’s name wasn’t made public because they’re a minor. The unnamed hacker was accused of working with Kurtaj and other Lapsus$ members to infiltrate Nvidia and phone company BT/EE, stealing data and demanding a $4 million ransom. The minor was sentenced to an 18-month youth rehabilitation order under “intense supervision,” including a ban on VPN use.\n\nThe two accomplices are the first Lapsus$ members to be convicted. Authorities believe other “digital bandits” in the group (suspected to be primarily teenagers in the UK and Brazil) are still at large. It isn’t clear what kind of payoff the hackers got from the ransom requests, if any, as none of the affected companies have admitted to ponying up.",

        "articleBody": "‘Like Logan...Insomniac is resilient.’\n\nInsomniac Games has weighed in publicly for the first time since hackers leaked over 1.3 million of the publisher’s private files. The studio posted on X (Twitter) that it’s “saddened and angered” by the cyberattack, describing the internal aftermath as “extremely distressing.” Insomniac indirectly alluded to the publication of gameplay footage from an upcoming Wolverine game, assuring fans that “Marvel’s Wolverine continues as planned.”\n\nThe publisher began by thanking supportive fans, many of whom rallied around the hacking victim in the thread’s comments, before relaying the burden the cyberattack inflicted on its employees. “We’re both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it’s taken on our dev team,” the studio wrote. “We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other.”\n\nInsomniac acknowledged some of the stolen content currently making the rounds on social media and the dark web. “We are aware that the stolen data includes personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors,” it posted. “It also includes early development details about Marvel’s Wolverine for PlayStation 5. We continue working quickly to determine what data was impacted.”\n\nThe Rhysida ransomware group took credit for the attack, claiming to have infiltrated Insomniac within 20 to 25 minutes, according to the group’s statement to cyberdaily.au. The hackers threatened to publish the stolen content if Insomniac, Sony or anyone else refused to pay its $2 million ransom. The group suggested that some data was sold, and the public dump allegedly comprised 98 percent of the complete set.\n\nIn addition to the Wolverine gameplay, the leak included files from Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, internal HR documents (including I-9 employment forms and termination docs), screenshots from Insomniac’s Slack channels and the contents of several employees’ PCs.\n\n“This experience has been extremely distressing for us,” Insomniac wrote. “We want everyone to enjoy the games we develop as intended and as our players deserve.”\n\nInsomniac alluded to its leaked protagonist to signal durability. “Like Logan...Insomniac is resilient,” the publisher posted. “Marvel’s Wolverine continues as planned. The game is in early production and will no doubt greatly evolve throughout development, as do all our plans.”",

        "articleBody": "As businesses and industries close out 2023 and look ahead to 2024, expect another year with significant growth, surprises, and expectations in energy and sustainability from what happens with fossil fuels, more plans to add nuclear power sources, carbon capture, evolving government regulations, and much more.\n\nThis past year saw plenty of continued evolution in how sustainability is viewed, and in how businesses and organizations operate and continue to strive for more efficiency, and 2024 will be no different.\n\nIt is almost a rare day anymore to not have a government announcement for a new clean energy investment or rule aimed at decreasing the environmental impacts of almost any kind of operation. That is especially true in the United States where the Inflation Reduction Act continues to establish its footing in the country.\n\nExpect those kinds of commitments to keep expanding, especially over the first half of the year.\n\nMore Regulations, Financial Reporting Measures\n\nRegulations and financial standards will be at the forefront in 2024. This past year the International Sustainability Standards Board issued its first standards related to sustainability disclosures by companies, and there was the creation of the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nExpect more along these lines in 2024, especially considering the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed emissions disclosure rules, which were first publicized in March 2022, still have not been finalized.\n\nAdvancement in clean energy and Fuels will Remain a Primary Focus\n\nRenewable energy will continue its march on overtaking more traditional and emissions-heavy power generation sources such as coal. Look for sources such as nuclear power, which seems to be more favorable among power brokers by the day, and geothermal energy continues to be seen as for the potential to push closer to net-zero goals.\n\nThe next COP may be almost a year away, but after the contentious end to the 2023 United Nations event, expect the role of fossil fuels in a clean energy transition to be even more of a focus of international talks.\n\nHydrogen efforts will remain strong, as well as increasing the use of alternative fuel sources, such as SAF. At the end of 2023, there were two completed transatlantic flights using SAF. Expect even more attempts at proving clean fuels work this coming year.\n\nCarbon Capture, Credits the Path to Sustainability?\n\nCarbon capture was all over the place by the end of 2023. Does it work? Will it be the technology to push countries toward a successful Paris Agreement? This next year could provide some more clarity on that scope.\n\nThe same goes for carbon credits. Are they a thing of the past? Is it just window dressing for sustainability strategies?\n\nNature Leads the Way to Emissions Reductions\n\nEven if not, look for nature-based platforms and financing to continue to rise. The elimination of obvious carbon emissions always seems to be more newsworthy and visible, but multiple untapped sources of improvements can be seen in forests, oceans, and agriculture.\n\nResearchers have also used natural sources such as coffee, fruit, sugar, and even chicken feathers to make sustainable materials. There were also big advancements in how things are made in 2023, from carbon-negative beer to making clothes out of textile waste and renewable resources.\n\nThe opportunities to expand on such ideas can seem endless, and surely there will be more stories of success in the coming year.\n\nA Critical Eye on Sustainable Strategies\n\nAs these types of programs, studies, and strategies keep popping up, so does the critical eye. No longer is it acceptable for businesses to say they are making changes or broad claims, they need to back them up.\n\nThere were numerous greenwashing lawsuits, several addressing the sustainability claims of large corporations. Governments also started having a say in what is acceptable. Expect the trend of making sure companies are following through with their statements to continue.\n\nE+E Leader Excited to Continue to Provide Important Information\n\nWith so much going on with energy, sustainability, climate, and the environment, there surely is plenty more that hasn’t even scratched the surface yet.\n\nAs the holiday week approaches, the staff at Environment+Energy Leader is going to take a deserved break and will be ready to come back on Jan. 2 to tackle all of these issues and more as we move into 2024. We look forward to growing our daily and featured coverage of these important topics and more for business leaders and wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday.",

        "title": "Harnessing Carbon for Sustainable Plastics: A Breakthrough in Polymer Production",
        "authors": "Kaleigh Harrison",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "The ubiquity of plastics in modern life cannot be overstated, from construction and clothing to vehicles and food packaging. These versatile materials, also known as synthetic polymers, have become indispensable due to their lightweight, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability. However, the inability to recycle them, particularly thermosets, has profound consequences for the environment.\n\nThis difficulty not only depletes finite fossil resources but also leads to the long-term accumulation of plastics in ecosystems, including in the oceans. To address this pressing issue, a team of scientists led by chemists at the University of Liège has pioneered a novel technique using carbon dioxide to create easily recyclable polyurethane plastics, offering a promising solution for sustainable plastics production.\n\nThe Urgent Need for Recyclable Plastics\n\nChristophe Detrembleur, FNRS research director at the Center for Education and Research on Macromolecules, underscored the significance of the challenge: “Plastics, also known as synthetic polymers, have met a large success thanks to their irreplaceable characteristics: they are light, cheap, and incredibly versatile… However, the fact that they are difficult to recycle, or even impossible to recycle in the case of thermosets, has serious consequences.”\n\nThe issue of recycling is not just an environmental concern; it also has far-reaching economic and resource implications. Traditional plastics rely on finite fossil resources, and their persistence in the environment is detrimental. Therefore, finding a solution to create easily recyclable plastics is paramount.\n\nCarbon as a Key Ingredient for Sustainable Plastics\n\nIn response to this challenge, researchers at the University of Liège collaborated with the University of Mons and the University of the Basque Country to develop an innovative approach to polyurethane plastics production. The breakthrough lies in the use of carbon dioxide, a significant waste product of modern society, as a primary raw material for creating the necessary building blocks or monomers for these new plastics.\n\nThomas Habets, a doctoral student at CERM and the lead author of the study, explained, “The structure of the monomers can be easily modified, making it possible to produce plastics with a wide range of properties, from highly malleable elastomers such as silicones to more rigid materials such as polystyrene.”\n\nUnlike traditional plastics with long molecular chains, these polyurethanes have a three-dimensional network structure, similar to thermosets that are typically challenging to recycle. However, the polyurethanes created using this technique feature dynamic chemical bonds, allowing them to be reshaped under relatively mild reaction conditions.\n\nVersatility in Recycling\n\nThe most significant advantage of this pioneering technology is its flexibility in terms of properties and recycling options. Habets elaborates, “These new plastics can be recycled in multiple ways, either by simply reshaping them through heating, or by mixing different types of plastic to create hybrid materials with new properties, or by breaking them down into their constituent monomers, which is ideal for eliminating additives such as dyes or recycling composites.”\n\nLooking ahead to the industrialization of carbon valorization, this groundbreaking study demonstrates that waste CO2 can serve as a valuable chemical resource. “This is the first initial study using our new building blocks and plastics,” said Christophe Detrembleur, “but it is quite remarkable to see that our materials can already reach properties similar to those of some conventional petro-sourced plastics.” This innovative technology holds promise as a solution for producing sustainable plastics with a wide range of properties suitable for various everyday applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the University of Liège’s research breakthrough in harnessing CO2 for the production of easily recyclable polyurethane plastics offers a beacon of hope for the future of sustainable materials. By reimagining the role of carbon dioxide in polymer production, this advancement paves the way for a greener, more environmentally responsible plastics industry.",

        "articleBody": "More than a month after Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker welcomed their baby boy, Rocky, the couple shared the first photo of their son.\n\nABCDEFG...You absolutely have to see this.\n \nMore than a month after Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker welcomed their first child together, the couple shared the first glimpse of their baby boy, Rocky Thirteen.\n\nThe pair posted a carousel of images to Instagram on Dec. 22, with several photos showing the pair cradling their little one in their arms. In one photo, Kourtney laid on top of Travis' lap, as he carried baby Rocky. The trio twinned in all-black outfits.\n\nOne snapshot also showed the Poosh founder breastfeeding her son, while another pic was of the Blink-182 drummer kissing his baby boy.\n\nRocky was born at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Nov. 1 when the clock struck midnight, according to his birth certificate obtained by E! News.\n\nTheir newborn son is the latest addition to the pair's blended family: Kourtney, 44, shares kids Mason, 13, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 8, with ex Scott Disick, while Travis, 48, is dad to Landon, 19 and Alabama, 17, and stepdaughter Atiana, 24, with ex Shanna Moakler.\n\nIn June, the Lemme founder announced she was expecting during a Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles, holding up a sign that read, \"Travis I'm Pregnant\" as she stood in the crowd. The unique announcement served as a clever recreation of his band's 1999 music video for \"All The Small Things.\"\n\nThroughout her pregnancy, the Kardashians star shared insight into their family journey, including inside glimpses at the couple's sex reveal and their fun-filled baby shower.\n\nHowever, her pregnancy took a scary turn in September, when she was rushed to the hospital to undergo fetal surgery, a procedure that saved her baby boy's life.\n\n\"I will be forever grateful to my incredible doctors for saving our baby's life,\" Kourtney wrote on Instagram Sept. 6. \"I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock.\"\n\nKourtney went on to reflect on the severity of her condition, expressing gratitude for the positive outcome.\n\n\"As someone who has had three really easy pregnancies in the past, I wasn't prepared for the fear of rushing into urgent fetal surgery,\" she continued. \"I don't think anyone who hasn't been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear. I have a whole new understanding and respect for the mamas who have had to fight for their babies while pregnant.\"\n\nFor Kourtney and Travis, having a baby has long been on the brain, with the couple expressing interest in expanding their family on the heels of their engagement in 2021.\n\n\"They would love nothing more than to have a baby together,\" a source previously told E! News. \"Kourtney has always wanted another baby and never felt like she was done.\"\n\nAs another insider noted at the time, \"Now that she's with Travis, she wants it even more.\"\n\nFast-forward to the following year, they opened up about embarking on their IVF journey, with Travis gushing that it was \"the most exciting thing ever.\"\n\n\"Family is everything to us,\" the musician said during a May 2022 episode of The Kardashians. \"To be able to make something together would be just incredible.\"\n\nBut later that year, Kourtney shared that she took a step back from the IVF process, noting that \"it was a lot\" and she wanted to focus on her nuptials.\n\n\"I took a break to just focus on our wedding,\" she told WSJ. Magazine last September, \"and getting married.\"\n\nHowever, just one month before sharing their pregnancy news, she made it clear that she would leave their next chapter in the hands of fate.\n\n\"We would love a baby more than anything, but I just really believe in what God has in store for us,\" she said during a May 2023 episode of the Hulu series. \"If that's a baby, then I believe that it will happen. Being happy is most important and being a good parent to my kids.\"",

New images from Netflix’s Avatar: The Last Airbender feature a terrifying bounty hunter and a mechanist.\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt’s been a long time since Netflix announced its intention to bring The Last Airbender back to live-action, but after the release of the show’s first trailer, the hype around the show is reaching a fever pitch. It’s gotten to the point where teases of even the smallest characters are sending fans into a frenzy. And that’s exactly what’s happening with these new images, which showcase Arden Cho’s June and Danny Pudi’s Mechanist. You can check out the images below via Discussing Film:\n\nJune is something of an icon in the Avatar community, first showing up in Book One to help Zuko track Aang. That obviously didn’t work the way Zuko would have liked, but June showed up again in Book Three, only this time, she was helping Zuko and the rest of the Gaang find Aang after he disappeared. As the images show, Cho clearly has June’s look down, but capturing her fascinating aura will be a whole other challenge. Cho’s time on Teen Wolf proved she’s more than up for the task, though.",

        "articleBody": "HBO has shared the first trailer for its upcoming Max original miniseries The Regime, which chronicles the fall of a political institution over the course of a year.\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe six-episode series stars Kate Winslet as the Chancellor of “a modern European regime,” who has previously led her nation to prosperity. The beginning of the trailer seems to hint at her wanting to take the next step towards relevance on the world stage with the line, “It is time to show America and the world precisely what we are worth.”\n\nThings then get rather unnerving, as she hires a new guard who seems to take his job a little too seriously, and her rule begins to seem less democratic and more dictatorial, with scenes of an apparent illness and violence outside the palace. The trailer for The Regime offers an intriguing look at what could be one of the surprise hits of 2024.\n\nJoining Winslet among the top line cast are Matthias Schoenaerts, Guillaume Gallienne, Andrea Riseborough, Martha Plimpton, and Hugh Grant. \n\nThe showrunner and writer on The Regime is Will Tracy, who previously wrote the 2022 film The Menu and several episodes of the hit series Succession, which ended its four-season run earlier this year. Meanwhile, directorial duties are being handled by Stephen Frears and Jessica Hobbs, both of which are best known for their dramatic works. Frears is behind the likes of State of the Union and Victoria & Abdul, while Hobbs has handled several episodes of The Crown over recent years.\n\nThe Regime will debut first on HBO on March 3, 2024 and will be available to stream via Max thereafter.",

        "articleBody": "The Chiefs rookie shared the deets while on the Airing It Out podcast with TJ Houshmandzadeh.\n\nTravis Kelce's teammate hasn't technically met Taylor Swift, but he has been in her orbit, and he raves about her magnetism.\n\nRashee Rice joined Fubo Sports' Airing It Out podcast with former NFL star TJ Houshmandzadeh, who asked the rookie wide receiver if he had yet to meet the Midnights singer. Rice laughed at the question -- perhaps because he knew the question was coming before the interview ended -- before sharing he hasn't met her.\n\n\"I've seen her, but I didn't go up to her like, 'Can I get a picture?'\" he said. \"Nothing like that, because those guys -- Trav, Pat [Mahomes], those guys invite us out because they know we're the only guys that see them every day and see them for who they really are. Not just like, 'Bro, you're a superstar football player.' Nah, this is Pat. This is Trav. And I wouldn't go up to another dude's girl and be like, 'Bro, can I get a picture with your girl?'\"\n\nRice, who recently set the franchise rookie record for most receiving touchdowns (7) in a season, inferred he's been part of Swift and Kelce's post-game hangouts. And while he himself would never approach the \"Anti-Hero\" singer for a pic, the rookie's been around her long enough to understand the impact she's had on everyone.\n\n\"I'm happy for Trav,\" Rice said. \"She's real good with, like, support, you know, with the team. And she brought a lot more fans to the team, too.\"\n\nRice, a second-round pick out of SMU who signed a four-year, $6.5 million rookie contract this year, praised the veterans on the team, who stepped in recently at a rookie dinner where his teammates racked up an $8,000 tab at the ritzy Ocean Prime restaurant.\n\n\"But I got vets around, so to be honest, they just scared me with the check and one of our vets [Marquez Valdes-Scantling] he actually paid that dinner for us,\" he shared.\n\nFor Swifties who are new to the NFL, rookie dinners are a form of hazing, in which veterans and rookies hit up an expensive restaurant and veterans order the most expensive items on the menu and foot the bill to a rookie. Last year, a rookie with the San Francisco 49ers making just $705,000 a year got stuck with a $322,000 dinner bill, or so it seemed.\n\nThe bill turned out to be a prank.\n\nIn any event, it seems just being in Swift's presence is quite the treat.

In one video, Umansky, who stars in Buying Beverly Hills, humorously declared himself the official videographer for the escapades of the two dynamic women. \n\nAnitta, the Envolver singer and GRAMMY nominee, enthusiastically proclaimed, \"Ay, ay! We are the funnest girls in the world, in the mountains! We know how to have fun, it's time.\"\n\nThey later changed into unconventional attire, donning bath towels instead of their ski suits. Umansky reshared an Instagram Story from Anitta, capturing the candid moments of the two changing and expressing their mutual admiration. \n\nAnitta, removing her ski pants, exclaimed, \"Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god, Lele. I love you.\" Pons replied, \"I'll always remember this.\" Anitta continued the sentiment in another Instagram Story, emphasizing the deep affection she feels for Pons.\n\nAnitta also expressed appreciation for Umansky's videography skills, acknowledging him as the \"best videomaker.\" The trio further showcased their skiing prowess, navigating the slopes with bottles of champagne in hand while wearing their unconventional ski attire.\n\nAnitta continued to share glimpses of their winter getaway on Instagram Stories, including photos of herself in a stylish all-white ski outfit. The group went on to celebrate DJ Pedro Sampaio's birthday in a ski lodge, complete with a playful champagne spray moment. \n\nUmansky made a special appearance in Anitta's Instagram Story, adding fuel to previous speculations about his separation from wife Kyle Richards.\n\nAnd while Umansky shared snapshots of his skiing adventures, Richards posted a picture from Punta Mita, Mexico, with the caption, \"Sometimes we just need to escape reality for a bit.\n\nLast month, Umansky expressed frustration over the constant speculation surrounding his 27-year marriage to Richards.\n\nThe couple, who announced their separation this summer, is currently under scrutiny as The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs the lead-up to their decision. Mauricio, however, says that much of the media coverage is unfounded.\n\nIn a recent episode of The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast from DearMedia, Mauricio shared his exasperation to Lauryn and Michael Bosstick, stating, \"What my life looks like right now is insane. It's out of control, the amount of stories that are coming out on a daily basis about, you know, everybody wants to know what's going on with my marriage. Like, I do too.\"\n\nIn the Nov. 16 episode, he explained that they are going through challenges like any other couple and emphasized that decisions about their marriage are not evolving daily. \n\n\"We're going through a struggle, we're going through issues just like everybody else does,\" Mauricio continued. \"And it doesn't change on a daily basis. If we're separated that means we're giving each other time to allow things to happen.”",

        "authors": "Rick Lane",

        "articleBody": "Artificial inelegance?\n\nWhen you kill someone in The Finals, they explode in a shower of coins, their body scattering across the ground like a tub of popcorn dropped by King Midas. As with much else about the Finals, this wowed me when I first saw it. What an ingenious way to depict death in a multiplayer shooter, I thought. It's spectacular without being grisly, satisfying without being gross. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sicko for virtual gore. But this seemed like a smart, clean alternative. \n\n The longer I played the Finals, though, the more its glittering corpses troubled me. The Finals is explicitly a game about exchanging death for money, a free-to-play multiplayer shooter where you compete in teams for virtual cash prizes, and pay real money to give your tracksuit-wearing competitor a snazzier outfit. Its smash-n-grab gunfights are satisfying in the moment, with sleek movement, precision-engineered weapons, and an exhilarating destruction mechanic. Look closer, though, and you'll spot an emptiness behind its contestants' eyes, one that speaks volumes not just about The Finals, but of modern multiplayer shooters in general.\n\nWe'll get to all that in due course, but first, let's give The Finals the credit it deserves. The premise is intriguing and unusual - a multiplayer shooter that blends the cooperative heists of Payday with the explosive destruction of Bad Company 2. The Finals offers three game modes to choose from, but the one you'll probably play most, Quick Cash, sees three teams of three players competing to grab Vaults filled with coins, then transfer them to cashout points to gain the funds. The first team to successfully cash out twice wins. \n\n But ah, a twist! The vault can be \"stolen\" by another team at any point, whether you're waiting for it to initially unlock, transferring to the cashpoint, or during the cash out process. The result is a rolling game of attack and defence, with the vault constantly changing hands in frantic three-way battles.\n\nFurther complexity is added by the composition of those teams. Before a match, you can select one of three \"body types\": light, medium and heavy. These are basically classes, with each having a different movement speed, health bar, weapon roster, and abilities. Light contestants are speedy glass cannons, with skills that revolve around stealth and athleticism, and small but punchy weapons like suppressed SMGs and sawed-off shotguns. Medium contestants play a supporting role, able to quickly heal and revive teammates, and deploy defensive structures like turrets. Heavy contestants are all about dealing and absorbing damage, wielding sledgehammers and big machine guns while putting down deployable cover. \n\n Even at this level, The Finals is an entertaining, tightly designed shooter. Movement is propulsive even when playing as the heavy, and navigating maps is fun in and of itself. Maps are littered with bounce-pads and ascension cables to speed you along to the action, while some classes get their own methods of enhancing traversal, like the Medium contestant's deployable bounce-pads, or the Light contestant's grappling hook. Combat deftly straddles the line between skill and tactics. While a sharp aim will certainly help you in the Finals, it isn't a case of fastest-finger always wins. Even the Light build can withstand a couple of seconds of sustained gunfire, giving you time to react to being ambushed and use your skills to level the playing field.\n\nBut the real magic in the Finals is provided by its destruction system, which lets you destroy the walls, floors, ceilings, and windows of pretty much any building that you're in. You can even level entire structures, trapping anyone inside in a twisted mess of rubble and debris. Blowing up the map is entertaining in its own right, but more importantly, it heightens the mixture of tactics and chaos inherent to a multiplayer shooter. If a team is defending a cashpoint on the upper floor of a building, for example, then you can blow up the walls to flank them, blow up the roof to attack from above, or blow out the floor underneath the cashpoint, sending it tumbling down to your level where you can attempt to steal it. More than once I've seen a team deliberately smash a building to pieces to conceal the cashpoint inside the rubble, making it harder for other teams to access.\n\nOn the flipside, the destruction system means the shape of a match can alter dramatically. For example, you might try to escape being attacked by smashing through a wall. But that then creates a new thoroughfare other players might use. Likewise, blowing out the walls surrounding a cashpoint might help you steal it, but it'll also make it harder to defend later. In one match I had, our three teams spent ages fighting over a vault at the outset of a match, slowly tearing the building apart as the vault gradually bounced down from the top floor to the ground. \n\n At its best, The Finals is electric, and feels like a breath of fresh air in the multiplayer FPS. So why the three stars? Well, the game does have some logistical issues. Movement and teamwork are so essential to The Finals that the game quickly breaks down when these elements are impeded. Heavy contestants, for example, have a much harder time moving around maps. Not only are they markedly slower than other builds, they also have no traversal gadgets. They can use certain abilities to smash through walls, but that doesn't help much when they need to travel upward or cross large gaps. This is especially problematic on maps like Skyway Stadium, where there are a lot of instant-death pitfalls and areas where you can just get stuck.\n\nThe Quick Cash mode also has an inherent flaw, which is that your efforts to control the play-space only really matter during the cashing out phase of the round. Neither unlocking nor chasing the vault improves your chances of winning, so you could just hang around for ten minutes and ambush the Cash Point in the final few seconds to win the match. Interestingly, this isn't the case in the three-round \"Tournament\" variant of the mode (known as Cash Out), which does provide small bonuses for grabbing and moving the vault. These can be the difference between qualification and knockout, which is much better. However, playing Cash Out also requires you to commit to (up to) three full matches and has ticketed respawns, which makes it significantly more demanding. \n\n Most of these problems are mitigated by The Finals' other mode, Bank It, which involves stealing coins off other players rather than from set points on the map. Although players are still divided into teams, working together is less crucial to success, so your differing movements speeds cause fewer problems. The downside is that Bank It is more of a straight up gunfight, with the destruction systems playing a less central role.\n\nIn short, while the Finals' game modes are fun, none of them make the most of the combat systems Embark Studios has designed. My bigger issue with The Finals, however, starts with its AI voiceovers. This is by far the most contentious feature of The Finals, to the point where it's actively put some people off playing it. Basically, the Finals has two unseen commentators that contextualise and respond to events occurring in the game. These roles have human actors behind their voices, though much of the dialogue you'll hear is AI-generated.\n\nTo clarify my own stance on AI, I'm sceptical about many aspects of it, from how LLMs have been developed using datasets that include copyrighted materials, to how the technology now poses yet another threat to the livelihoods of creatives. That said, I'm not against the notion of using the tech in games if it's to do something new and innovative. And at first, I thought that was what The Finals was doing. When a match starts, the game randomly assigns your team a name like \"The Powerhouses\" or \"The Retros\". Initially, I thought these names were being made up on the fly, and the AI voiceover was dynamically adjusting the commentary to fit. That would be a justifiable use case, as that isn't something a human can feasibly do. \n\n But it wasn't long before the team names began repeating, and it became clear that The Finals' voiceover uses standard narrative design techniques, but with AI voices instead of human actors. Not only is this kinda crummy, it also makes the game worse. Quality-wise, the voiceovers aren't egregiously bad. You might hear an oddly intoned sentence or clipped phrase, but they do sound mostly like humans. Unfortunately, they also sound profoundly boring. Their personalities are basically \"enthusiastic American\" and \"clean-cut British lady\" but they go no deeper than that, and their commentary is neither insightful nor interesting. It's also a missed opportunity to put a real stamp of personality on the Finals. A great commentator can not only add enormous entertainment value, they can define that experience for the entire audience. Just look at what John Motson did for BBC football, or what Craig Charles added to Takeshi's Castle. For millions of people, their names are synonymous with those televisual experiences.\n\nHaving a reactive voiceover to a multiplayer shooter is a fantastic idea, but Embark Studios' execution of it sucks. The lines are dull, the AI voices cannot make them interesting, and you just end up mentally filtering out the noise. Crucially though, this isn't an isolated issue. In most areas of its presentation, The Finals lacks a distinctive identity. Your characters are all just regular joes wearing grey tracksuits. The game uses italicised impact for its font. The weapons are all standard pistols, shotguns, HMGs and so forth. The maps are clean and colourful, but there's nothing especially memorable about them. Even the allocated team names are bland. You'd hear more imaginative examples at your local pub quiz! \n\nMore broadly, the entire game show premise is inconsistently applied. It's supposed to be a virtual game show, a game within a game scenario. But then why is there a huge ring of spectators surrounding the map? Why are the maps themed around real-world locations like Monaco and Las Vegas? And given the game's emphasis on clean, modern visuals, why do you respawn through an eighties' arcade-style \"Insert coin\" menu? Perhaps it's because I grew up with nineties' British game shows like Funhouse and The Crystal Maze, where the presenters were weird, the prizes were rubbish, and the experience was what ultimately mattered, but as a game-show experience, I find The Finals' game-show theme to be deeply unimaginative. \n\n Only the developers know why The Finals is so aesthetically anodyne. But if I were to speculate, I'd say it's so the game can more easily support the huge variety of weapon and character skins that bankroll every modern multiplayer FPS. Nearly all your major multiplayer shooters are Ready Player One now, an ugly morass of garish weapon skins and brand-based avatars with no consideration for thematic consistency or artistic integrity. In a game like Call of Duty, which is supposedly a serious military affair, this stuff stands out like Winnie the Pooh in the Somme. Better to keep your shooter's visual style as neutral as possible, then you can put anything in and it'll look alright.\n\nThis is why I feel queasy that The Finals' most distinctive visual flourish is a shower of coins. It's a stark reminder that the Finals' main concern, both thematically and semantically, is making money. And yes, most games are made with the hope of a financial payoff at the end. But I don't want to feel that desire from them while I'm playing. I want to be invested in your game's world, in its characters, in its tactics, in its meta, whatever you've got. I want it to be about more than the coins I can earn, the skins you can sell to me. For all the potential in its combat, I don't think the Finals has a whole lot to get invested in. The game modes are too uneven, and the theme feels like it's waiting for the brands to drop. The combat and destruction tech make it worth a few hours of your time. But no matter how much cash the Finals flashes, I've no desire to spend any of my own.",

        "articleBody": "It's looking increasingly unlikely Starfield will have the quite same kind of longevity as its Bethesda RPG stablemates, but that isn't discouraging the studio from continuing to tinker with the space adventure's core - and one intriguing addition Bethesda has now confirmed is that \"new ways of traveling\" are coming at some point in 2024.\n\nBethesda teased new modes of travel in an update shared on Reddit to accompany the launch of a small patch addressing Starfield's \"pet-asteroid\" bug - which has amusingly caused some players to be relentlessly followed across the solar system by doggedly persistent space rocks.\n\n\"We've been hard at work on many of the issues you've posted,\" Bethesda explained in its message to players, \"and expect an update early next year that will include a large number of 'in-progress' quest fixes as well as FSR3 and XeSS. Though we fixed several quest issues from occurring, in-progress quest fixes are much harder to fix and we've built a new system to correct those without you having to roll back your save.\" \n\nSo far so moderately interesting, but then Bethesda starts talking about the new stuff; \"We're also hard at work on many of [the] new features you asked for, from city maps, to mod support, to all new ways of traveling (stay tuned!),\" it continued, adding, \"these will be rolling out with a regular cadence of fixes and updates we expect to have roughly every six weeks.\" \n\n Exactly what these \"new ways of traveling\" might entail does, regrettably, remain unclear. Starfield's endless loading screens have been criticised for robbing the game of any meaningful sense of exploration, but it seems unlikely Bethesda would be willing or able - given Starfield's engine limitations - to overhaul space travel in any significant capacity. Whatever it has in store - I'm gonna go with moonscooters - don't expect to hear anything more until the new year.\n\n\"Starfield pairs near-impossible breadth with a classic Bethesda aptitude for systemic physics, magnetic sidequests, and weird vignettes,\" Eurogamer deputy editor Chris Tapsell wrote in his three star review earlier this year, \"But in sacrificing direct exploration for the sake of sheer scale, there's nothing to bind it together.\"",

        "articleBody": "The horror filmmaker’s fourth film was previously scheduled to release next Christmas.\n\n Fans will have to wait a little longer for Jordan Peele’s next movie.\n\nEW has learned that the fourth film from the Oscar-winning director is no longer scheduled for a Christmas 2024 release. The move was strike-related.\n\nHowever, horror fans will still get to enjoy a new macabre project from an acclaimed young auteur next holiday season, as Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu is set to release Dec. 25, 2024. The remake of F.W. Murnau’s timeless 1922 vampire film stars Bill Skarsgård, Nicholas Hoult, Lily-Rose Depp, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, and Willem Dafoe. \n\n Peele was recently announced as a collaborator on the mysterious upcoming video game project OD from Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear Solid, Death Stranding). The project, which features actors like Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer, will blur the lines between gaming and cinema. “It is a game, don’t get me wrong, but it’s at the same time a movie, but the same time a new form of media,” Kojima said at The Game Awards earlier this month. “I grew up watching movies, and I’m a game creator now. Jordan grew up playing games, and he’s a movie director now. So this collaboration will be really awesome.”\n\nPeele’s three directorial features — 2017’s Get Out, 2019’s Us, and 2022’s Nope — have earned over $600 million around the world, signifying that the comedian-turned-filmmaker has become one of the few directors in Hollywood whose name alone can draw audiences to the box office. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Get Out in 2018.\n\nPeele has previously teased expanding the universe of Nope in future projects. \"We're not over telling all of these stories,\" he said last year. “The story of [Michael Busch’s] character has yet to be told, I can tell you that. Which is another frustrating way of saying, I'm glad people are paying attention. I do think they will get more answers on some of these things in the future.”",

        "articleBody": "See an exclusive sneak peek at \"Part Two: The Scargiver.\" The director sets up what's to come in the next chapter of his new sci-fi saga.\n\nWarning: This article contains spoilers from Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire.\n\nZack Snyder has assembled his team of sci-fi heroes. Now it’s time for them to fight. \n\nOver the course of Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, streaming now on Netflix, the mysterious warrior Kora (Sofia Boutella) recruited a ragtag group of fighters from across the stars in order to protect the farmers of Veldt from the authoritarian army of the Imperium. That first film ended with the group arriving back on Veldt, which has wheat fields that are highly sought by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) and his army. \n\nBut that’s not all they want anymore. Now that Kora’s identity has been confirmed as the adopted daughter of galactic regent Belisarius (Fra Fee), next year's Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver will find the Imperium coming at the planet with everything they’ve got. \n\n\"Part Two is a war movie,” Snyder tells EW. “We know that Noble's alive and Belisarius has given him the task of finding his daughter and bringing her back to him at all costs. So the stakes have risen for the village from ‘hey, we want some of your grain’ to now ‘you’re harboring the most wanted fugitive in the history of the galaxy.’” \n\n EW has an exclusive sneak peek at the sequel, featuring two of Kora’s comrades, the gladiator-general Titus (Djimon Honsou) and the noble warrior Tarak (Staz Nair), in the throes of battle. Although he won’t get specific on timing, Snyder says that a huge portion of The Scargiver is this battle on Veldt. Given Rebel Moon’s conscious evocation of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, fans should expect a climax on par with that Japanese classic’s massive village battle, albeit on a sci-fi scale. \n\n“It was fun to plan the battle and try to figure out how Kora and the village could stand a chance against a world-destroying spacecraft,” Snyder says, referring to the Dreadnought commanded by Noble. \n\nThe Scargiver will also revisit the royal family that ruled the Motherworld until they were wiped out by mysterious assassins. Viewers got brief flashbacks to the royals in A Child of Fire, since Kora was once a bodyguard for the young princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald). The robot Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) explained that Issa, whose name has mythic connotations in this world, was supposed to “usher in a new age of peace and compassion.” \n\n“Issa is the redeemer. She’s the second chance,” Snyder says. “A version of her has existed in the past. Two other times in the history of the Motherworld’s existence, a version of Issa has been born into the royal family to reel ‘em back in, because every few thousand years they get completely out of control. Issa is born to unite them again and bring order.” \n\nSnyder teases that The Scargiver will reveal more about what really happened to the royal family, and what role Kora might have played in their fate. Even the title is relevant.  \n\n “The title has to do with Kora,” Snyder says. “We learn something in Part Two about Kora's ‘crimes,’ what she's wanted for and why the Imperium is after her.” \n\nBut even when The Scargiver hits Netflix next year, that won’t be the end of Rebel Moon. For one thing, Snyder is planning on releasing R-rated director’s cuts of each film, though release dates have not yet been announced. But the director also sees his new sci-fi universe as “a bottomless pit of stories.” That’s one reason that he cast 36-year-old Fee in the role of the galaxy’s tyrannical ruler. \n\n“This hasn't been confirmed, but I was hoping if there were ever a spinoff, like a TV show or something, about the younger days of Belisarius, that I would love a young actor to play that part. So we just aged him for this,” Snyder says. “Now I'm not saying that's happening or that there's even really discussions of that, but I think that he's such a rich and interesting character and he's such a great actor that the potential is really amazing. If the story were to continue past the two movies that we've made, his role would increase exponentially, as you can imagine.”\n\nIt’s a tried-and-true method that worked pretty well for Star Wars creator George Lucas, who cast Ian McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine in old-age makeup for Return of the Jedi. McDiarmid was then able to play a younger Palpatine in the Star Wars prequels.",

How do you ensure that the roles and permissions are properly set in all of these apps?\n\n“Then you need to buy another app that does this. So maybe you need to look at an app like Okta to do this syncing for you, user syncing for you across these apps, so your licensing cost adds up. Which is why the trend is now moving toward an integrated suite of apps, which is where Zoho plays a role.”\n\nFuture of Content Collaboration\n\n“The future of content collaboration involves: how do you automate your business workflows? There is a lot of business content you put into content collaboration platforms, into your communication platforms. How do you automate this process?\n\n“There is a lot of unstructured data that you put in. How do you create structure for it? Let’s say you’re putting in an insurance document, a car insurance premium document into your content collaboration platform. Can your collaboration platform automatically detect that what you’re putting in is a car insurance premium? Zoho WorkDrive has a feature called data templates that basically provides structure to your unstructured content.”\n\nAI and Content Collaboration\n\n“It’s important] to add an artificial intelligence layer on top of that automation engine. So the AI layer should automatically classify documents as if you have sensitive content in it. That is, you have a spreadsheet, and your spreadsheet has credit card data in it. There are some registration patterns to find. But what if the AI engine, the AI layer, automatically finds it for you? What if the AI layer contextually understands your business content so effectively that it shows you the right set of documents to look at?\n\n“So the AI layer will sit on top of the automation engine and make the automation engine much more powerful. So here is where companies like Zoho are playing a huge role in storing a lot for our business customers, the content of our business customers. It is important to add a responsible, secure AI layer on top of it. And this is the place we’re in right now – this is the right time for us to innovate in this area.”",

It reveals major investment in AI – and also major concerns.\n\nI spoke with Neil Cohen, Head of Go-To-Market Strategy for Portal26, about a new survey that details how businesses are using generative AI. The survey results reveal major investment in AI – and also major concerns.\n\nSurvey Results: AI Hopes and Challenges\n\n“There are findings [from the survey] that validate what a lot of people are thinking, but I think there were a couple of surprises. I think when people talk about generative AI, they talk about the hopes and fears.\n\n“So, you have 80 plus percent of the companies saying, ‘This is the greatest thing.’ And then you have the same number of people saying data security and other issues are a downside. So how do you balance those things?\n\n“I think the next biggest stat was that, when we looked across all industries – 12 different industries – 73% of them in the last year or so had a misuse incident with generative AI. So those are the ones that are admitting it, right? Seventy-three percent. When you look at some verticals, like the legal profession, a hundred percent of them had a problem.”\n\nThe AI Learning Curve\n\n“When you’re in ChatGPT or some other AI app, that prompt box looks like a search box. So if you treat it like search, you’re going to get a different kind of response than if you treat it like a prompt. Search is a hundred percent about intent; generative AI is about creation. That’s a different kind of thing. So what you’re going to ask it, how [you’re] going to talk to it, or have it help you do, is very different. And so that’s a big part of the challenge of people trying to adapt to this new technology.”\n\nProblems with Shadow AI\n\n“You’ve got a lot of [people] using ‘shadow AI,’ where you have people going, “I don’t care if my company banned it – I’m going to [use it anyway]. I’m going to do the work, I’m going to come back, I’m going to put it back in the system.”\n\n“So you’ve got a lot of people who are working with a productivity [tool] that many people still don’t understand. More and more AI apps are public models – when you feed data into them, it becomes public.” \n\nAI and Job Creation  \n\n“[Technology shifts] created new jobs and continue to create new jobs, and I think AI will create new jobs like you just mentioned earlier: prompt engineer. [Creating] strategic uses for artificial intelligence, applied AI – how are you going to apply it? What are the right uses? How do you manage it with an organization?\n\n“There are going to be lots of developments that are going to come out – we don’t even know what the new jobs are yet. Prompt engineer didn’t exist two or three years ago. It does now. What else new is going to exist?”",

        "articleBody": "One of Microsoft's most-loved OSes is about to ride off into the sunset, forcing tens of millions of users to upgrade. \n\nWindows 10 will likely go down in the annals of history as one of Microsoft's most beloved operating systems, right up there with Windows XP. It first launched in 2015 and is currently the company's most-used operating system by a huge margin, with over 70% of the market. It's a very popular OS, but it's about to get shut off soon as Microsoft has already set Oct. 14, 2025, as its end-of-life date. If Microsoft holds to it, analysts predict we'll likely see one of the largest forced upgrades in history—with up to 240 million computers unnecessarily being tossed into a landfill.\n\nIndustry research firm Canalys has written a report on the upcoming euthanasia of Windows 10, which ITPro flagged. The report raises questions about Microsoft's policies when it comes to software lifecycles. It notes that Windows 11's hardware requirements have made a lot of people ineligible to upgrade, a likely stumbling block that has slowed the adoption of Windows 11. We've covered this extensively in the past, as Microsoft's newest OS isn't compatible with CPUs that are only a few years old due to the required TPM 2.0 module and late-model 64-bit processor. \n\nThe report states that over 240 million devices could be sent to a landfill prematurely despite being still viable computers in good working condition. Because they don't have the requisite hardware for a newer OS, they'll have zero resale value and won't be able to get refurbished and resold. The number of computers headed towards this fate would be a stack of laptops over 600km taller than the moon, according to the report. In addition to the unnecessary waste this event could create, it would also strain global IT departments as they are forced to upgrade millions of devices.\n\nThe report notes that no current legislative body controls the device lifecycle process, so it's up to Microsoft, and it can do whatever it thinks is prudent. Microsoft has to make money, so it wants people to upgrade, and therein lies the rub. But Redmund has apparently seen the writing on the wall here, as just this month, it announced it would extend security updates for Windows 10 by three years, taking it into 2028. The only catch is these updates won't be free, though Microsoft has yet to announce pricing. Microsoft has already put Windows 10 into stasis, with the OS no longer receiving any more big updates going forward, so the current version is final.\n\nWindows 10 currently has 400 million users, according to a report from October, so it seems Microsoft is trying to figure out a way out of this mess. Forcing people to pay for security updates could also be a non-starter, as the pricing could be too high for millions of users to afford. The report notes that Windows 7 offered a similar scheme that cost $25 for one PC for a year of updates, but that price eventually ballooned to $100 a year. It says if Microsoft does that again, the cost-effective route for most folks will be to upgrade to a cheaper Windows 11 machine—bringing us right back to the original problem of turning millions of working computers into e-waste.",

        "articleBody": "Microsoft’s latest OS is not for everyone due to its controversial changes from Windows 10, but it can be made much better with just a few easy tweaks. \n\nMention the words “Windows 11” to any tech-savvy person these days, and you’ll get either an eye roll or a brief shrug that's physically the same as uttering “Meh.” It has not won over the masses, to say the least. Many feel it doesn’t do anything better than Windows 10 while offering a new interface that repels Windows diehards.\n\nThankfully, many changes can be reversed or tweaked to make the OS easier to use, and we’re here to walk you through them. You'll also want to look at some cool new features. Here are our top Windows 11 tips.\n\n1. Restore Your Right-Click Options\n\nOne of Microsoft's most infuriating changes to Windows 11 is the redesigned right-click menus. The company removed most previously available options from the default view to make it more compact. However, it did keep the full list of options around. It moved them one layer deeper in the UI, forcing you to click “Show More Options” to see it.\n\nSome of us have to use this every time we right-click, which is highly annoying. Thankfully, there’s a way to revert to the old menu permanently. All it involves is adding an entry to the registry via the command line. Here’s what you must do to get the old right-click menus back via Microsoft:\n\n    Right-click the Start button and choose Windows Terminal\n\n    Copy and paste this into the window: reg.exe add \"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\\InprocServer32\" /f /ve\n\n    Close Terminal\n\nTo see the changes, reboot your PC or restart File Explorer. You can restart it by killing it in Task Manager, then clicking \"Run new task\" and typing “explorer.exe” in the window without quotes.\n\n2. Customize Your Quick Settings\n\nIf you glance at the System Tray in Windows 11, you’ll notice a small “gear” icon next to it, along with the icon for your speakers. A menu pops up if you click the icon, giving you quick access to frequently toggled items. It's like a control panel on your smartphone. The options let you cast your screen, change Wi-Fi networks, enable Airplane mode, and more.\n\nMany of these seem more relevant to mobile users, though, which might be your cup of tea. On the desktop, they’re not so helpful. Thankfully, you can remove most of them or add ones not currently shown. Click the gear and the “pencil” icon to customize the menu to your heart’s content.\n\n3. Use the Xbox Game Bar\n\nDon't be like your humble author and ignore this feature if you don't have an Xbox. It's incredibly useful and something that has been missing from gaming for ages. It's a built-in toolbar for gaming that drops down from the top of the screen when you press Windows + G. The most valuable feature, in this PC gamer's opinion, is it provides a moveable, transparent overlay on the screen showing your CPU, GPU, VRAM, and system RAM usage, along with your current frames-per-second as well. \n\nYes, you could previously use MSI Afterburner for this, but you had to download, run, and configure the software to do it, and that's a bridge too far for many. Plus, it's stuck in the corner of your game, which is not always an ideal location to glance at.\n\nBut that's just the tip of the iceberg for the Game Bar. You can also use it to adjust your audio settings, snap a screenshot or record your gameplay, view your current system resources, and chat with Xbox friends (supposedly, as we did not test last this feature). Our favorite is each of the modules (performance, resources, audio, capture, etc.) can be pinned to the desktop and made transparent. If you have a big monitor, you can easily stash them on the edges of your game and keep tabs on what your PC is doing without them getting in the way. And of course, make sure Game Mode is enabled under Settings -> Gaming > Game Mode for maximum performance and no interruptions about updates.\n\n4. Use Multiple Desktops\n\nThis is a returning feature from Windows 10, but it's been upgraded. To use it, you need to enable the Task View icon in your taskbar (Settings -> Personalization -> Taskbar). Click it to add a new desktop. You can then easily switch between them by hovering over the icon and selecting the desktop you want to use. \n\nWhat makes this feature great is that you can easily separate your preferred apps for work and not work, and quickly swap them when needed. New for Windows 11, you can also change the wallpaper for each desktop to make it easier to identify at a glance. Whatever theme you've selected will be applied across the board, though.\n\n5. Tweak Your Privacy Settings\n\nWe've always worried about third parties tracking us as we use our computers. But in Windows 11, Microsoft has become the tracker (insert Captain Phillips meme here). The company has begun touting that the more it's aware of your activities, the more it can personalize suggestions, ads, and the overall experience. It’s similar to the line companies like Facebook use, where they say they can only serve you relevant ads if they know what apps you’re using.\n\nIt makes sense, sure—but that doesn’t mean we have to like it or even allow it. Thankfully in Windows 11, you can disable these settings. First, head to Settings and click Privacy & Security > General. From there, you can disable all the settings below, as they will serve you ads from Microsoft.\n\nNext, click back to Privacy & Security and go to Diagnostics & Feedback. In this box, Microsoft says it is required to collect data on you to keep your Windows 11 PC “secure, up to date, and working as expected.” Sadly, there’s no way to opt out of this, but at the bottom is a box that should be unchecked if you care about privacy. It lets Microsoft uses your diagnostic data (excluding website traffic) to show you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations. You can safely turn this off.\n\n6. Try Out Live Captions \n\nMicrosoft has added Live Captions to Windows 11 for videos. It’s a neat feature, if not consistently accurate. By default, the captions appear in a bar on the top of your display, but you can change its location and have it appear as a floating box. Although you might expect it to work only with Microsoft’s media player or Edge browser, it works with almost anything, including Google Chrome and VLC.\n\nFor people with hearing impairments, it also works in games that don’t offer subtitles. A Redditor discovered this cool trick, and the thread notes there are some caveats for games. The biggest is it doesn’t work in full-screen mode, only windowed mode. It also has a slight delay, as it has to hear the words before transcribing them, so there can’t be any music playing in the background. It's only in English and struggles with music videos where people are screaming/growling (sorry, metal fans).\n\nStill, if you find a game that doesn’t offer subtitles, it’s worth a shot.\n\n7. Try Focus Mode\n\nYou don’t need to be a writer on deadline all day to appreciate the new Focus mode in Windows 11. It was rolled out with the 22H2 Windows update, and it’s a great way to shut the outside world out for a bit and get some work done. You can enable a session by going to Settings -> System -> Focus and clicking Start Focus Session.\n\nOnce enabled, your PC will go into Do Not Disturb mode for the allotted time. Apps in the taskbar will not flash when notifications arrive, and badge notifications in the taskbar will also be disabled.\n\nOnce it begins, an on-screen timer appears in the corner. It includes a built-in notification for when you need to take a break, which is on a 20-minute timer by default. You can add Spotify to the app to listen to music while working. Additionally, the app lets you add various tasks from Microsoft To Do. \n\n8. Move the Start button Back to the Left Corner\n\nThe above list of Windows 11 tips is a collection of features you should check out when first using the OS. There are several other pitstops we believe every Windows 11 user should make, but these last three tweaks are subjective, so you might not want to do any of them. Regardless, these are the things we’d change immediately upon first booting Windows 11.\n\nFirst up is the Start button. By default, it’s in the center now, and we hate it. To move it back, go to Settings -> Personalization -> Taskbar. Under Taskbar Behaviors, you can change the location of the Start Menu.\n\n9. Experiment With Dark Mode\n\nThough it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, we appreciate Dark mode since Light mode is too bright for our tastes, so don’t skip this new feature in Windows 11. To fiddle with it, click Settings -> Personalization -> Colors and enable it under “Choose Your Mode.” Click Custom to adjust it the way you prefer.\n\n10. Boost Your Power (Settings)\n\nMicrosoft hasn’t really figured out where to put this collection of options. As a result, in Windows 11, power settings exist in three different locations. Go into Settings -> System -> Power to start, but the most important ones are still in Control Panel.\n\nBut even when you go to Control Panel -> Power Options, you must click “Change Plan Settings” and then “Change Advanced Power Settings.” You’ll see a box that looks like it’s from Windows XP. In that window, you can customize your power settings at a granular level, whether you prefer maximum performance on a desktop PC or want your laptop to sip battery.",

        "authors": "Liz Stinson",

        "articleBody": "The office has become a place of contentious experimentation. It’s never been harder to know what the office means to workers today, and what it might mean in the future. Companies’ return-to-office mandates have created rifts between employers and employees, who are often at odds when it comes to where the best work gets done—in the office or at home.\n\nBut could a better office convince workers that coming in for their 9-to-5 is worth the commute? That is the question we set out to answer in our in-depth guide to the current state of office design and the RTO debate. For this report, Fast Company spoke with dozens of sources across the design world, workers in various sectors, real estate experts, and company executives to uncover what workers want from their offices today, and how leaders can help create an environment that exceeds those expectations. \n\nFrom those conversations, one thing is clear: Building a better office isn’t just about fulfilling a wish list of amenities. Creating a workplace employees want to come back to requires an understanding of the current office’s shortcomings—and the willingness to design our way out of them. This report aims to help company leaders prepare themselves for the shape-shifting office of 2024 and beyond.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCompanies are facing an existential question: How, after more than three years of remote work, can they get employees back to the office? Not long ago, remote work was the exception, not the rule. According to a Gallup survey, 75% of workers were fully on-site in 2019, with only 4% of workers regularly working from home. During the height of the pandemic, those numbers flip-flopped, and office attendance plummeted by as much as 90% in major cities. Now, even with return-to-work mandates in full swing around the country and across almost all sectors, those levels have only rebounded to about half of pre-pandemic occupancy. \n\nIn short: Offices are still sitting empty most of the time.\n\nThe reasons are obvious enough—commuting eats up precious personal time, offices are full of distractions, and you can usually control the thermostat at home. But certain aspects of modern office design felt broken even before the pandemic. Open floor plans, conference rooms, and privacy booths were all initially meant to foster collaboration or allow for focus, but anyone who’s worked in such an office knows that rows of open seating can get noisy, and those privacy booths are about as comfortable as an airplane seat. \n\nFor the companies trying to figure out how to bring workers back to the office, this means they are now in the persuasion business, forced to reevaluate the appeal of the office itself. If the pandemic proved what employees long suspected—that the office wasn’t necessarily necessary to their jobs—can the right office design convince them otherwise? \n\nThis report aims to explore that fundamental question through the lens of workers, employers, and the designers who shape the office environment.\n\n—Words by Margaret Rhodes\n\nThe office you want\n\nTo start, we posed a big question to some of the leading design firms in the U.S.: What does the office of 2024 look like? Fast Company turned to five architecture firms: Gensler, NBBJ, SpacesOf, SO – IL, and Studio O+A, each of which is grappling with with that challenge, both for clients and for their own firms. We learned that it’s not just the office floor plan that needs revision; it’s how those floor plans fit into a future where the typical Monday-to-Friday work week is no longer a given. \n\nAccording to a McKinsey report from July 2023, the majority of office workers are combining one or two remote days with in-person days, with some subtle variation across levels of seniority and commuting distance. With that in mind, we gave each studio a specific return-to-work scenario, from the full-time return-to-work mandate to the hybrid office to one that’s designed for a Gen Z staff, and asked them to show us an office that you might actually want to go to. Here’s what they came up with.\nThe Full-Time Office\n\nDesign firm: SpacesOf\n\nThe challenge: The company has mandated a Monday-to-Friday return to work policy, and it is causing friction among employees.\n\nThe solution: Combine adaptive reuse with the old company housing model.\n\nAaron Taylor Harvey and Leila Khosrovi, cofounders of SpacesOf, don’t view the office as the problem—it’s the commute that’s keeping people at home. “People are really thinking about the time they’re committing in the car, and they don’t want to give it back,” Harvey says. Their conclusion? “The only way that you can make an office that people want to go to every day is if you make it directly adjacent to wherever they live.”\n\nSpacesOf proposes pulling this off by converting mid-rise towers in urban downtowns into bustling mixed-use buildings that stack apartments on top of offices and leisure space—a contemporary version of the company housing model that was popular around the turn of the century. \n\nSpecifically, Harvey and Khosrovi see a big opportunity in adapting buildings from the 1940s, which are abundant in American downtowns and originally designed with natural daylight in mind. Upper floors could be built out into compact apartments and offered to employees at an affordable rent; middle floors would be allocated toward desks, meeting rooms, a library, and an auditorium space for product launches and big team meetings. “These are the kinds of things that people are coming into work for,” Harvey says. “Large gathering spaces are actually what a lot of corporations need right now.” \n\nLike those older (and now-defunct) company towns, these newer buildings would provide its employees with a suite of basic lifestyle needs, such as daycare facilities and fitness classes. They differ when it comes to their broader surroundings: Workers at this building wouldn’t be secluded in a small rural town; they’d be living in the middle of a downtown center, with restaurants, entertainment, and nightlife nearby. The building itself, thanks to a ground floor coffee shop, open-air arcade, and sidewalk seating, would also blend into the neighborhood. For those who choose to live on site, the crucial thing is that there’s zero time spent commuting. “If the company wants everyone to be in an office every day,” Harvey says, “then they have to provide the full set of conveniences, including housing and childcare. It’s the whole village.”\nThe True Hybrid Office\n\nDesign firm: NBBJ\n\nThe challenge: Employees are required to come into the office three days a week, and get to choose their own days. The space needs to flex between maximum capacity and emptier office days.\n\nThe solution: Throw out the old model of assigned desks and designated conference rooms; design a more fluid floor plan.\n\nThe state of return-to-office remains in flux, but so far, the data points to hybrid work as the new normal. A recent McKinsey report found that 56% of those surveyed have a regular hybrid work arrangement, and go into the office somewhere between one to four days a week. That number is even higher for millennial respondents, suggesting a lasting shift among those who will be in the workforce longer. Architecture firm NBBJ saw this shift coming early during the pandemic, and in 2020, while most office buildings were emptying out, it started tinkering with a new hybrid office prototype in the middle of Manhattan. Their team found that hybrid work is all about flexibility—and not just in terms of scheduling. \n\nPart of NBBJ’s flexible office theory comes from a 2018 report in Translational Psychiatry that compares individuals to orchids, tulips, and dandelions. Each group responds differently to its environmental surroundings, requiring more or less precise conditions to thrive. In order to accommodate all three types (and all the hybrid types in between), NBBJ envisions an office where workers can move around freely, choosing tables or nooks that best suit them or their tasks. Instead of what partner Matthew Somerton calls “a sea of desks,” NBBJ’s hybrid office features shared tables in the middle of the floor, with booths, pods, and ample greenery lining the perimeter. (The emphasis on biophilia comes after a few studies, including one recently published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, linked exposure to nature to higher cognitive performance and reduced stress.) \n\n“We thought it was odd that we do all our collaboration in closed hermetic spaces, and our focus work out in the open,” says Somerton of typical open floor plan offices. NBBJ’s plan inverts that older model. Workers who need a bit of quiet can choose to work from booths or corner desks with full tech setups—what Somerton calls “three-sided offices and pocket parks”—and centrally located meeting areas are available for those who feed off others’ energy. The “mixer” tables also include screens, so that employees working remotely can feel more integrated into the office. And if it gets too noisy, employees can always book breakout rooms.\n\nThe Fully Remote Office\n\nDesign firm: SO – IL\n\nThe challenge: The company is embracing remote work, and no longer keeps a central office.\n\nThe solution: Give employees access to a network of physical spaces, spread across different time zones.\n\nWhile most companies are adopting so-called “remote-capable” policies—implying that a physical office is still available—others are doubling down on remote work, choosing not to renew leases on office headquarters. For employees of those companies, working remotely doesn’t necessarily mean working from home. “Part of the reason that people are not going back to the office anymore is because of this desire to be outdoors and traveling,” says Florian Idenburg, a cofounder at SO – IL. Idenburg arrived at that observation after spending six years on The Office of Good Intentions: Human(s) Work, a Taschen book on the role of design in the workplace, but says he also noticed that desire among his own cohort. “I have a group of friends who have been completely nomadic, basically working in Airstreams and driving around the country,” he says. \n\nWith that in mind, SO – IL dreamt up a network of prefabricated cabins that are managed by one company but scattered around the country—near, for example, state and national parks. Employees could book overnight stays at what Idenburg calls “gig houses,” and immediately tap into the company’s digital infrastructure upon checking in. Instead of computer monitors, each cabin comes with large wood veneer panels with LED digital displays showing work tasks and coding projects. Rather than sitting down and plugging into a desk, workers can use a provided headset and VR helmet to access team-wide projects and use AI-powered voice commands to dictate work. Wi-Fi and work tools would be available, from a cabin in the woods. A lot of the pain points that come with working on the road would cease to exist. \n\nIdenburg acknowledges that a network of off-the-grid, solar-and-wind powered cabins is a futuristic proposal for any office configuration. But for companies that only exist across digital systems, these gig houses—or some subscription-based version of them—could also become a way to attract talent, encourage work-life balance, and offer workers the kind of freedom that remote work promises. “What’s the role of a designer in shaping the workspace?” Idenburg asks. “Are we making the workplace more humane, or is it just a way to keep people more trapped within a labor system?” The gig houses, by contrast, “suggest complete autonomy.” \n\nThe Suburban Office\n\nDesign firm: Studio O+A\n\nThe challenge: The CEO has inherited a suburban office park campus that they are remaking for a new business, and most employees have a driving commute.\n\nThe solution: Design an office park that functions like a town square.\n\nA truism of the return-to-office movement is that people will come to work to see other people. Historically, offices haven’t lent themselves to spontaneous connections—at least, not to the degree that bosses say they do. “In the past, you would commute to some sort of office park, spend the whole day inside, grind out the day, and then go home,” says Primo Orpilla, O+A’s cofounder. “So, what is the new ritual of suburban work?”\n\nWhen Studio O+A started thinking about how to redesign the suburban office park for the new reality of hybrid work—in which people get to choose whether they come in or not—they saw an opportunity sitting right in front of them. Suburban campuses often sprawl, with buildings separated by empty paved lots. Studio O+A’s design turns those oft-underutilized areas into a bi-level town square, so employees returning to work can untether from their desks and socialize with their colleagues. The campus is anchored by the “connector,” a two-story structure with enclosed seating on the ground floor and open-air walkways on the upper platform. Benches and charging outlets give workers an alternate place to sit, and fire pits on both levels provide warmth during colder months, as well as an organic gathering point for meetings, planned or not. Design details like wind guardrails and central heating and cooling would make these alternative spaces available year-round.\n\nOrpilla and his team also took into consideration the suburban commute, and the fact that every errand likely requires another drive. To make life more convenient for workers, businesses on the ground level would include services like daycare, dry cleaning and laundry, hair salons, banking, and preventative healthcare. “People need amenities besides foosball tables and a bar at work,” Orpilla says. “They need these basic things, and they don’t need them 30 minutes away.”\n\nWhile it’s reminiscent of big tech campuses that offer drop-off laundry services for its young employees, these businesses would also be open to the public. The town square wouldn’t only belong to company workers; it would be shared with the community. The idea, Orpilla says, is to do away with the severe separation of your desk life and your personal life. “Maybe people initially come in because of the merchants,” he says, “but then they also have community, friends, and this agora for the sharing of ideas.”\nThe Gen Z Office\n\nDesign firm: Gensler\n\nThe challenge: Of the employees, 60% are under the age of 30—some never worked in an office before the pandemic.\n\nThe solution: Focus on individual agency and sustainability.\n\nTo design an office for Gen Z workers, Gensler turned to its own staff. In a charrette with some of the firm’s youngest employees, principals Jordan Goldstein and John McKinney learned that their colleagues want flexibility and choice in the workplace. “They don’t want to work in a linear pattern—they want to choose how they construct their day,” McKinney says. “They talked about how diversity and multiculturalism among the group was a baseline and a given, and that because of that, that there should be a lot of choice.”\n\nGensler’s solution is a series of physical environments that employees can transition in and out of throughout the day. Employees might start the day in the ground floor atrium, at one of the communal tables, or they might go first to the upstairs lounge, which was designed to resemble a hotel lobby and flexes between a café and a bar, depending on the time of day. Later, they might meet around some of the communal desks or attend a larger presentation in the rotunda-like conference room. Crucially, these areas are open and not hierarchical, so that younger employees can make connections and seek mentorship.“The whole office becomes a series of opportunities and spatial environments that weave together, allowing for choice throughout a day,” Goldstein says. A two-story screen cuts through the atrium and landing, providing a fluid display for everything from all-hands meetings to product demos, and creating a sense of continuity throughout the office. \n\nIn addition to choice and transparency, Gensler’s Gen Zers also said they want to see sustainable design in the workplace. “They want to be able to visibly connect with it,” Goldstein says, pointing toward construction details like unfinished mass timber and biophilic elements like a living wall behind the two-story digital display.\n\n—Reporting by Margaret Rhodes\n\nWho’s actually returning to the office?\n\nIt depends on who you ask and where they live. Data from remote work software firm Scoop and Boston Consulting found the number of fully in-office workers across industries dropped this year from 49% to 38%. These numbers signal that the full-time office of yesteryear is a dying breed, even after repeated calls by big firms to come back or else.\n\nScoop gets its data from its Flex Index, which tracks the in-office policies of more than 7,500 companies. In its most recent quarterly report, the data showed that remote dominates many industries: professional and financial services (87% flexible), insurance (91%), media (92%), and even the majority of real estate, facilities, and construction jobs. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the technology world, from the tools enabling the home office to the gigantic firms setting the corporate agenda around today’s workplace, has long defined remote work and the return to the office. To get a view of the future, look at today’s startups, which suggest remote will only become more prevalent. \n\nScoop found that 97% of technology companies offer fully remote or hybrid options. That’s why the firm’s quarterly flex report found hubs like San Jose, San Francisco, Austin, and Seattle rank as the nation’s most flexible metros, with 90% or more workers spending at least some time out of the office (in cities and states in the south, that plummets to 60%).\n\nBut distill that sample down to new startups, and remote becomes unavoidable. Businesses founded in 2021 or later were 93% remote—the rate declines the older a company gets, hitting 63% for those founded before 1980—while 74% of companies under 500 employees were fully flexible. For firms with head counts between 500 and 5,000, fully remote drops to 35%. Two-thirds of new firms under 100 employees were fully remote, says Rob Sadow, Scoop cofounder and CEO, and traded expensive real estate for broad access to talent.  \n\n“What’s going to happen over time is companies will age out,” Sadow says. “Newer companies aren’t getting started full time in the office, so a whole generation will never experience that. Twentysomethings that will be future executives will know no other experience but managing and leading in a flexible environment.”\n\n—Reporting by Patrick Sisson\n\nThe office data designed\n\nAs hybrid work schedules remain common and office return policies struggle to catch on, many companies are seeing their offices only sparsely populated with workers on a daily basis. Many are wondering what they should do with these now oversized offices. A more precise and actionable question is: What are the spaces within these large offices that workers today actually use?\n\nIncreasingly, there is data that can help provide an answer. Indoor sensor companies like XY Sense and Butlr provide office buildings with technologies that can reveal where people spend time when they go to the office. By tracking movements and dwell times, these companies can show companies how their workers use their office space, which types of spaces are most popular, and how usage changes based on the time of day and the day of the week. They can also reveal which parts of an office are deserts, left mostly unused throughout the workweek.\n\nWith this kind of information in hand, companies can redesign their offices, replan their meeting room sizes, or even eliminate entire chunks of their overall square footage. Seeing how the space is used is the first step. Here’s what the data is showing now.\n\nDouble down on small meeting rooms\n\nButlr’s sensors track both the usage of a space and its fullness, helping companies to understand which types of spaces are popular, and which are perhaps bigger than they need to be. “We know just by looking at the data that people prefer to use dual meeting rooms, which is the smallest meeting room. It’s always occupied,” says Jiani Zeng, cofounder of Butlr. “When you look at the bigger meeting rooms, they’re less booked, and when people book them, they’re always underutilized. It’s designed for 10 people but there’s only one or two people using them.”\n\nGet rid of shared desk space\n\nThis data also shows what types of workstations people want to use. In one customer’s office, Butlr’s data showed that shared desks were almost always empty, even on the busiest days. “Open desks are designed for collaboration but people are actually not using them. They always prefer to go to meeting rooms instead of spending time in open areas or hot desks,” Zeng says.\n\nRethink high-traffic zones\n\nThere may only be half as many people in an office today compared with 2019, but some places within that office still see a lot of coming and going. Hallways and the entrances to bathrooms are particularly high traffic zones, and according to Butlr’s data, workstations that are near those zones are almost always avoided. Knowing that people don’t want to work next to a constant stream of passersby, companies should rethink how they utilize spaces next to these naturally active areas.\n\nDitch the open ‘collaboration spaces‘\n\nXY Sense has a data set of 100 billion data points a year, collected from buildings around the world. In aggregate, this data has given the company an eye on some of the biggest trends in the changing workplace. “When you talk about it, it’s actually pretty obvious. The enclosed small collaboration space is the most popular type of space across the world,” says XY Sense CEO Alex Birch. The company’s data shows these rooms being used more than three times as much as open collaboration spaces. “Our theory behind that is there are more people that are remote, so there’s less need for a larger room, and people are going to smaller rooms to have their remote calls instead of staying at their desks.”\n\nCreate the spaces people want to use\n\nTechnology giant Cisco has developed a platform for tracking and analyzing office usage, called Spaces. The data collected through this platform has helped companies around the world to better understand how their offices function. Cisco uses Spaces for its own offices, and has gathered insights into the ways its real estate portfolio functions, down to the fact that most of its employees tend to do most of their work either alone or in small groups of three or less. They’ve used that insight to shape their office layouts. “We now are building 70% minimum ‘we’ space, 30% ‘me’ space,” says Bob Cicero, Cisco’s Americas hybrid work and sustainable real estate leader. \n\nLet what works inform future real estate decisions\n\nCisco has used the data from one of its offices to directly influence the design of another. When the company was planning a redesign of an office in Atlanta, it turned to the historical use data of its New York office and identified the types of spaces—and sometimes specific rooms—that were most used and most popular. One particular meeting room stood out for how often it was booked and fully occupied. “We used that data to prove that people loved it, so we built four of those types of rooms down in Atlanta,” Cicero says. This type of data-based design decision making is now being used to determine the look and feel of all new Cisco offices. “We’ll look at all these data sets consistently. It’s just something we’ve built into how we manage and look at space now when we’re going to do future projects,” Cicero says.\n\n—Reporting by Nate Berg\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nSo, if you’re a young company looking to lease office space, where should you put down roots to attract the right talent? A few cities are faring better than the rest. The clobbering commercial real estate teams have experienced due to hybrid work schedules and remote work has been well documented: Every week seems to bring additional reports about financial pressures facing landlords and stagnant employee activity. But the office apocalypse isn’t as severe, or evenly distributed, as headlines might make it out to be. Analysts and experts at Avison Young, a commercial real estate brokerage and advisory who have faith in the long-term value of the office, mapped out leasing activity in a handful of major U.S. cities, finding new rules for active offices.\n\nAs Harry Klaff, Avison Young’s Principal and U.S. President, and Danny Mangru, the firm’s Capital Market principal, explain, no single narrative explains each city—all are multidimensional and contend with a shift toward high-quality office space, migration to the Sun Belt, and renewed focus on transportation. But within these four maps lie lessons for the future of the office market. \nManhattan: Train Traffic is Better Than Foot Traffic \n\nSuburban commuters have bolstered office buildings across New York City, signaling that they want to get to the office—and get out—as fast as possible. Avison Young found that despite a struggling market, Manhattan boasts record-high total availability and transit-dense areas like Central Park and Hudson Yards have weathered the real estate recession relatively well. \n\nThe difference between Wall Street, on the tip of the island, and Midtown, near suburban-serving rail, is “night and day,” says Klaff. Since March 2020, the vast majority of 100,000-square foot leases signed in the city have been near Penn Station, Grand Central, and Times Square. For workers coming downtown, the ability to walk out of Grand Central and basically walk into One Vanderbilt, a gleaming new tower near the station, is “a nice bonus,” says Mangru.\n\nChicago: Happy Hour Isn’t Dead\n\nThe city’s famous skyline has long centered around the Loop, a downtown business district built for commerce a century ago. Circled by rivers and elevated rail, it’s more vacant than ever after recent shifts in the workplace. But head west, over the movable bridges spanning the river, and you’ll see where the action is, real estate-wise. The West Loop and Fulton Market, the latter a warehouse-district turned into cool condos and a ritzy restaurant row, have seen office activity flourish due to the live-work-play aspect of the neighborhood. West Loop’s location near commuter trains and light rail have helped towers here maintain high rental rates, and even poach tenants. Fulton Market has grown by more than 4 million square feet in the past five years, with cranes still swinging above active construction sites. \n\nThe residential magnet effect is perhaps most pronounced on the LaSalle corridor, an strip of planned office-to-residential conversions that happen to sit in a housing dead zone amid empty office space. The city hopes sparking transformation there will revitalize the city’s storied office stock. \n\nSan Francisco: Luxury Leads \n\nAs a tech-centered, incredibly expensive market, San Francisco may have fallen the furthest, with offices emptying out and creating doom loop debates about the city’s future. But in the Financial District, the center of high-end, trophy office space, leasing remains strong. This is partially a response to the dearth of new offices built here in recent years. Tech demand and rents soared so high, landlords didn’t feel the need to invest when profits poured in. So top-flight buildings have seen activity, including larger leases by Quantcast, Hive, and Patreon in SOMA, and big deals from AI firms, which are beginning to sign for serious square footage adjacent to downtown, including big leases by Anthropic and OpenAI in Mission Bay. Still, the overwhelming majority of large leases since 2020 have been signed in the Financial District. “That’s probably the one bright spot in San Francisco,” says Mangru. And as the boom and bust of the city’s history suggests, that’s more than enough to drive an office frenzy.\n\nHouston: Invest in Innovation\n\nThis Texan metropolis has long been a one-horse town. Energy, namely oil and gas, have long dominated the office market. The energy bust and pandemic have underscored that historical lack of diversity; as of fall 2023, Houston’s total office availability stands at 30.2%, making its offices the fifth most empty of a major U.S. metro. There are bright spots, however.\n\nIn recent years, efforts to diversify the downtown, including introducing rail and new industries, have catalyzed activity in small little pockets across the city. One of the brighter lights has been the Medical Center, site of Helix Park, a new 37-acre research hub developed to take advantage of the city’s large medical district and existing research talent (additional medical schools coming downtown will only add to the talent and spinoffs seeking offices). In general, medical developments and medical office have been strong performers, Avison Young has found, and the new high-tech lab buildings opening in Houston. “It’s outperforming the rest of the market,” says Mangru of the Medical Center. “It’s got almost inelastic demand,” he adds, suggesting its popularity will surge regardless of rising prices.\n\n—Reporting by Patrick Sission\n\nIt’s a renter’s market: How to get the most out of your landlord\n\nEven with all the data in the world, there’s no crystal ball that can tell us what the future holds for offices. But experts agree that, for those who are currently in the market for a physical space to run a business, now is an advantageous moment to be an office tenant. Landlords are facing huge vacancies and gargantuan loans are coming due, and many are willing to invest heavily to keep current tenants and lure new ones in. That’s taken the form of everything from discounted rent to funding the interior construction of office spaces to new office building amenities and even free furniture.\n\nTo learn more about the state of affairs in the office market, Fast Company spoke with real estate brokers, facilities managers, designers, and experts. Here’s how the office market is changing for landlords, building owners, and banks—and the better-than-ever deals office tenants can expect to get right now.\n\nConcessions grab bag\n\n“There’s probably never been a better time to be a tenant. The market is in a new stage of being reset. Landlords are reducing their rents significantly, they’re increasing their work allowances significantly, and also increasing the free rent period. . . . I’d say the numbers for tenants have improved 30% since 2019. You can expect on a raw space [in a class A building in New York] that you will get a work allowance of about $130 to $150 a square foot, which is what is required to build a space. On a 10-year lease—and a 10-year lease is required for a build out—you would get 12 to 15 months of free rent.\n\nIn the past landlords build out offices to 80% of cost. They’re now building it out up to 100% of cost. Or they will throw in some additional things. They’ll put in the marble reception area, when before it would have been a carpeted reception area. And a lot of the major landlords are building amenity centers, which is a huge cost for them.” —Ruth Colp-Haber, partner, Wharton Property Advisors, Inc., New York, and Counselor of Real Estate\n\nTenants have the leverage\n\n“Some tenants will say, ‘we’ll stay here.’ They will take maybe less space, but they’ll also ask the landlord to spend a lot of money to fix it up and make it pristine. There are several organizations that I know where the landlord just renovated their offices entirely just because they wanted them to stay. The company that was next door to my office, the landlord basically took that tenant and gave them a whole new office space, desks and everything.” —Robert Pliska, president, Sperry Commercial Global Affiliates, Birmingham, Michigan\n\n“Now you can most likely get furniture and some moving costs covered, and on top of that some free rent. We’re seeing that in some cases double what it was previously.” —Mike Brehm, partner, Kenwood Commercial, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\n. . . But only so much leverage\n\n“The cities that are more walkable, more livable, more integrated, particularly as you see them oftentimes in Europe—they have much lower vacancy rates. So, your ability to negotiate is limited to a degree. But even there, you’re starting to see requests for more amenities.” —Jeffrey Spaulding, CEO, Nordic Foresight, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n“Adding something like a cafe is never an easy thing, so you’d have to be a really big user and pulling a lot of weight to have something like that happen. But if you’re a typical 3,000 to 10,000 square foot tenant, your requests might be driven around ‘I need more third workplaces’ or ‘I need more conferencing opportunities.’” —Nils Snyder, partner, Kenwood Commercial, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\n“For the best-in-class buildings, you’re not going to have as much negotiating power as you will with your A-minus and B buildings. It all depends, submarket to submarket. If you’re looking in downtown Minneapolis at a B building, then you have all the negotiating power that we’ve historically ever seen.” —Mike Brehm\n\n—Reporting by Nate Berg\n\n5 CEOs on how RTO is really going\n\nThe post-pandemic return to the office has been a process of trial and error, particularly for leaders, who are accustomed to having all the answers. We spoke to executives who shared what’s been working, and what hasn’t in bringing people back.\nEmbrace evolution\n\n“We closed our office in March [2020] and went fully remote for about a year. We moved into this space in November of last year; we built it out and spent all this money. When we took the space, we were like: Let’s get a long-term lease because prices were low because of [the pandemic], and let’s take a lot of square footage because we’re signing a 10-year deal and then we’ll have space to grow. \n\n“We’re now about 200 people—about 60% of our people are in Boston and 40% are remote. It’s really hard to get everyone back. As a leader, you have to figure out the few moments that you want to have everybody around, and then figure out how to foster collaboration and communication—what we call it collision. \n\n“The business is thriving, but when you walk around our 35,000 square foot office with 20 people in it, it feels like we’re going out of business. We felt after [the pandemic] people probably wouldn’t want to be close to each other, but we actually found the opposite. They don’t go to the wide open spaces where you have plenty of room. They go to the areas where they’re on top of each other. We’re going to downsize, and we will definitely optimize for putting people on top of each other again. It’s not like [they want] offices where they can close the door—it’s like, put me in the pit with everyone else.”  —Mike Salguero, founder and CEO of ButcherBox\n\nMake the commute worth it\n\n“We see a lot of people coming in more than the requested three days a week. Part of our thinking was, if we’re going to call people back to the office, we wanted a space that was very comfortable, made them productive, but also made them feel like there was a reason that they weren’t working at their house. We knew that we needed to have a space that felt worthy of the commute and the lack of flexibility. \n\n“We wanted to use design to bring in that more casual feel. We looked a lot to different hospitality features. There are barstools at a counter, there are two lunch areas, there’s soft seating and couch breakout areas, living room vibe areas, more professional conference rooms.\n\n“There’s tons of bright color everywhere, there’s gradients, lots of plants. We really wanted the space to feel like you were walking into the Magic Spoon universe, and be super immersive. It really was a stake in the ground that it was different from working at home. \n\n“Running a physical product company, you do just need to often look at the dimensions of a box in person and confirm it works. So, we’ve tried to create places where you can go and do that. I think if everyone was just sitting on a screen taking video calls and they were just in the office versus home, that trade-off probably feels less worth it to them. I think it does work. If people are having fun then they’re more likely to come in, and that was the goal.” —Greg Sewitz, co-CEO of Magic Spoon\n\nMake the office an event\n\n“We have not made hard requirements. It’s kind of surprising to me that there are a lot of companies that are just mandating return to office seemingly without great reasoning. Or at least if they have reasoning they aren’t disclosing it.\n\n“I personally have been coming in a lot, almost every day lately. Mostly because my dog really likes coming into the office, is the real truth of the matter. He walks up to me every morning and stares at me like, ‘Are you going to take me in or what? I want to see my friends.’\n\n“We’ve continued to watch how people use our offices. I think we have about 25% of the people in Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We designed the office for hybrid, so there’s a lot of flex space to support these programmatic uses, like the product team is going to come in and do the quarterly product business review. That was a really good decision. That has worked out really well. Probably the best use we get out of the office is when people do these events. And if I would do it over again, I would definitely do that again.” —George Fraser, CEO of Fivetran\n\nRestructure expectations\n\n“Our in-office presence strategy is focused on delivering our business goals and fostering our culture. To realize this, our corporate workplace model was built on the concept of “presence with purpose.” We expect employees to be in office at least 25% of the time and to ensure this time is meaningful, rather than fulfilling an arbitrary requirement, we’ve established what we call ‘core weeks.’\n\n“During core weeks (roughly 22 per year) we coordinate major meetings and events—from ideation and planning sessions, farmer’s markets, and food trucks to external speakers and educational series. Employees typically come in for two to three days each core week, and are encouraged to prioritize engagement with colleagues, including both formal meetings and informal connections, such as grabbing coffee or lunch. We believe this structure offers the right balance of individual flexibility with face-to-face collaboration.” —Mark Smuckers, CEO of Smuckers\n\nEmbrace flexibility\n\n“While our front-line staff remained in office and at our resorts throughout the pandemic, corporate associates required a different approach. As we completed a new global corporate headquarters in Orlando this fall, we took the opportunity to rethink our work model while navigating the return to office for our 1,500 Orlando-based corporate associates. Taking a ‘human-centric’ approach, we implemented what we call an ‘adaptable work model,’ which empowers different departments and teams within the company to decide whether an in-office, remote, or hybrid work model suits them best. This gives our teams the freedom and flexibility to choose how and when their associates will work from the new headquarters while still meeting business needs.\n\n“We also incorporated amenities that promote overall health and well-being such as a state-of-the-art workout facility, live green walls, ergonomic, low VOC furniture, and innovative, open, and collaborative work and meeting spaces, promoting intentional collaboration and celebratory moments to maximize our time together. This approach has remained popular among our associates with internal surveys showing hybrid work and flexibility continue to be top of mind for our people.” —John Geller, president and CEO, Marriott Vacations Worldwide\n\n—Reporting by Nate Berg, Elissaveta Brandon, and Liz Stinson\n\nGenerational Gripes\n\nAnd how do workers themselves feel about being back in the office? There’s almost a soap opera-ish quality to the ongoing struggle between corporations and workers to define the new rules of the workplace. The relationship is, bluntly, in flux. But the will-we-or-won’t we binary about remote or return some have taken not only misses the great middle that tends to favor a hybrid approach, but also overlooks the gradients and gray areas of personal experience that often inform what, if anything, an in-person office experience means today. Fast Company asked workers across generations about what it would take to get them back into an office five days a week, and every one had a personal, nuanced take about how important cubicles and collaboration truly are today. \n\n“Obviously during the pandemic, things had to start moving more remote. I ended up leaving New York and moving in with my parents in Maryland when freelancing roles started dropping off. It was necessary. But I really value being around other people, and I think I always look for opportunities to be in person. Not wanting to be in office will reduce the number of opportunities you have. I think I would be open to a five-day-a-week in person. But every single day doesn’t feel necessary. I’m working with a friend, a director, on her student film next weekend, and we’ve been doing prep work online, but we’ll be in person next weekend.” —Jazmine Lawrence, 26, creative producer living in New York City\n\n“If five-day-a-week in the office was a mandate, I’d go back. I wouldn’t quit. I’m back in the office three days a week now, and will caveat that my apartment is a 10-minute walk from the office. I like being around people. Advertising is so collaborative. If we can get in a room with creatives, it’s 1,000 times easier than trying to deal with a pitch over Zoom. Small talk over Zoom is just not the same. That’s a huge reason why I’m pro being back in the office. I don’t think I would ever want to be fully remote. I also think people who started their career fully remote are much more apt to want to stay that way. But I also think it’s definitely stunted career growth. People are lazier and more complacent.” —Kate Wallace, 29, account manager with ad agency VMLY&R in New York City office\n\n“I have complete control over my own time and schedule, and I make good money, work less hours, and do work that I care about and that matters. I have a heavenly office space that I helped design and share with two friends in an old printing factory and an at-home office that I use frequently. I will never work ‘full-time’ in an office again. Hell, I’ll never work ‘full-time’ again. I need autonomy and agency. It would have to be the craziest, most badass job that would even spark my interest. If Chuck Norris and Simone de Beavouir (resurrected) called me up and said they wanted to make a philosophical, feminist kung fu movie at a coworking space in Lisbon and needed my advice for four days a week, I’d probably say yes, but I’d still put them on a six-month contract and explain my working style.” — Laura Hilliger, 41, founding member and director at We Are Open Cooperative, a coop creative consulting group\n\n“We’ve got R&D, we’ve got manufacturing to build our machines, and we’ve got construction, which you can’t do remotely. In March 2020, we sheltered in place—let’s flatten the curve—and when it ended, we needed to make five years of HR policy decisions in a few weeks. So, we sent the engineers back, and people on the support team could stay at home; I hunkered down in the Midwest to be near work sites, so I could drive out in case we couldn’t fly. This is, for me, my biggest learning. What happened next was, there was mistrust that emerged. Now we’re all back in the office, and it’s changed the culture. I think that you need the oxytocin flying, you need to feel a bond. There’s a big divide in Silicon Valley today; if you’re building hardware, you’ve been back in the office since shelter in place ended.” —Kim Abrams, 44, cofounder and CEO of Petra, an underground robotic construction company\n\n“I like that I can live anywhere. I live in Wellington, a small town in West Palm Beach, Florida where I moved during the pandemic. I don’t exactly love where I’m living, but my wife really likes Florida. It’s been all good to be remote and have a kid. I’m even taking classes at Harvard’s extension school, and wrote a paper that got published. I think the hybrid model is a joke; if it’s hybrid, it still determines where you live. There are certainly benefits to going back to the office. If I had a local office where it was reasonable to commute, I wouldn’t mind a hybrid situation. I might actually enjoy it because you get to know your coworkers better. But I have a daughter whose three who I can now spend way more time with. It seems wrong to say I want to go back to the office so that I can ignore my daughter.”— Ian Kelk, 45, product marketing manager at Clarifai, a remote-first computer vision platform company\n\n“I was working at Bed Bath and Beyond when [the pandemic] hit. There was a panic because the entire office that month was shifted from cubicles and offices to a completely open plan, with the exception of the C-suite. It was bad from the get-go, and it was just to pack more bodies in a smaller space—pure economics. I would have kept the cubicles, and I would have kept directors in their offices that also functioned as meeting rooms. Maybe it’s kind of old school, patriarchal corporate thinking, which is what I was brought up in, but cubicles and corner offices did provide a certain amount of stability. Now I’m at a different home furnishings company, RGI, which was recently acquired by Mayzon. I go in three times a week. The office is very well thought out. There’s a beautiful kitchen area, a place to dine, and there seems to be a far healthier camaraderie. There’s been this level of trust, which makes a big difference, and was something I didn’t feel at Bed Bath and Beyond.” —Barbara Weston-Robinson, 70, former global trend and design director at Bed Bath & Beyond\n\n“We were in Montclair, New Jersey, but we also had just rented an office in Hudson Yards. Our lease was signed for March 1, 2020, so we never actually got there. I was one of those people who insisted you had to be in the office—I only hired people from North Jersey. I like the whole bouncing neurons, people sharing ideas, having lunch together. Then, when [the pandemic] happened, we started Zoom right away like many people did, and what happened is, we became better managers. I really mean that. I’m not saying this is for everybody, but I did it better that way. We ended up having a couple meetings in Hudson Yards and then we let that lease fall, too, and then we ended up doing nothing, and to this day, we still have nothing. I don’t think we’ll go back to the office because we still spend time together. I don’t see the need to. I think for most people it’s a waste of energy to be in there.” —Michael Potters, 68, cofounder of Glenmont Group, an executive search firm \n\n—Reporting by Patrick Sisson and Rebecca Barker\n\nThe new rules of office design\n\nIt’s nearly impossible to synthesize an entire report’s worth of knowledge into, but that’s exactly what we asked ten of the leading architecture and interiors firms to do. When faced with the question—what is your number one rule of design for this new era of the office?—they came back with a list of ideas that can help guide decision-makers when thinking about the office of 2024 and beyond.\n\nDesign with intent\n\n“With every coffee shop, hotel lobby, and model apartment starting to buzz at the same design frequency, it is important to design an office that is true to the place, to the company’s purpose, to the very truth about why people work there. Are you a company that believes in the promise of community-building? Place your office in a storefront and welcome the public in. Are you a company that believes in choice and mobility? Then design your offices in a series of hub locations that allow for engagement and collaboration in a variety of settings. Is your truth built on the idea that any idea may be the next big one and that it may come from anyone? Build an office that is transparent, user-hackable, and dynamic—an office that shows that nothing is complete and that there is always more to do.” —David Galullo, Rapt Studio\n\nDesign places to go, not desks in a row\n\nRestaurants are booked weeks in advance; live music is a gold mine, hotels are full, and tourism is up. The tyranny of delivered convenience is coming to an end. People need places to go. Work is one of those places. If we take seriously the social, educational, and creative role workplaces have in our lives, we can create purpose-driven space that celebrates the power of physical presence. Work becomes a destination not by pretending to be a house (“resimercial”) or a hotel lobby but by framing and assisting the most essential of human activities: people in a room making things. —Aaron Taylor Harvey, founder and creative director of SpacesOf\n\nDesign for connection \n\n“This new era of workplace disassociates from monotonous routines and behavior that conforms to a singular way of working. The workplace now has an opportunity to support people to work in a way that helps them to thrive best and celebrate people’s uniqueness. It’s more intentionally curated with connection points that foster meaningful connections, integrations that encourage personal and professional growth, support for physical wellness and mental well-being, and inclusive solutions that help everyone feel empowered to be their authentic selves.” —Studio O+A\n\nHumanize the workplace\n\n“There is a paradigm shift happening in today’s office design, moving away from utilitarian uniformity and standardization to embrace customization, adaptability, and well-being. Humanizing the workplace involves creating spaces that transcend mere functionality and aim to cultivate connection, comfort, and inspiration. Ultimately, this translates to prioritizing individuals’ needs for a holistic and fulfilling work environment, which includes elements like natural light, attention to craft and materiality, and spaces that encourage collaboration, socialization, and focus.” —Darina Zlateva, director, Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF)\n\nPrioritize the spaces people really need\n\n“We know that shifting work patterns mean spaces like outdoor workspaces, libraries, and meditation spaces are no longer optional amenities, but essential to the office. Curating a variety of spaces for people and offering them the autonomy to choose where to work within the office in whatever environment suits them best creates not only a more effective space, but a better overall workplace experience. It not only makes people sense; it also makes business sense.” —Janet Pogue, global director of workplace research for Gensler\n\nDesign with authenticity\n\n“Always choose authenticity over imitation. An office isn’t a home or trendy hotel lobby. It’s a professional space for collaboration and focused work. But an office also isn’t merely walls and desks—it’s a canvas for invention. When designed intentionally to reveal your brand’s spirit, an office environment will energize people like you can’t believe. And with authenticity guiding the design, you can create a hospitality-like, stylized space that feels like home.” —Tom Polucci, firm-wide director of interiors at HOK\n\nDesign for health and well-being \n\n“Think first and foremost about material health (no VOCs), paying attention to acoustics, and designing a good balance of open and enclosed work settings, which enable choice. With mental health concerns on the rise, design with nature as your inspiration: Create oases of calm with greenery and natural finishes and, most important, make spaces for people to take a moment to reset and recharge.” —Linzi Cassels, global interior design co-director at Perkins&Will\n\nDesign with—and for—purpose\n\n“Purpose defines not just how we work, but why we work. And it’s what unites successful companies and their people. When it comes to office design, we believe workplaces should be equally purposeful, designed with intention to connect employees to a company’s highest aspirations and values. This is realized through design approaches, that among other things, create places of health, belonging and delight.” —NBBJ\n\nDesign for flexibility \n\n“Almost every new workplace project in our studio since the intense pandemic period has taken a very close look at adaptability and how its spaces can be flexible to work around optimizing Cultural Social Capital, evolving patterns of work, setting demands through a week and making all spaces work hard every day.” —Matt Jackson, CEO of BDG architecture + design\n\nBalance functionality and inspiration \n\n“Our approach is about providing comforts and amenities that set spaces apart from the norm and don’t compromise efficiencies. If implemented well, this approach should improve productivity, creativity, collaboration, and overall company contentment. There is no perfect formula that will work across all offices; listen to your people, observe their work styles, and design to that. Bring in added layers that soften work environments and make them feel more like hospitality spaces. Design to have employees want to come to the office—our approach always thinks about employees as paying members.”  —Laetitia Gorra, Roarke Design Studio \n\nReporting by Elissaveta Brandon and Liz Stinson",

        "title": "Why is there no snow this Christmas?",
        "authors": "Associated Press",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "This year, you probably won’t be getting a white Christmas unless you live in Alaska. \n\nFor most Americans dreaming of a white Christmas, this year’s prospects aren’t good.\n\nAlthough parts of the Rockies and Midwest already have snow or could get a fresh dusting by Monday, other parts of the country that are normally coated in white this time of year are still sporting their drab late-fall look.\n\n“Some people will get their dream, their wish, and get a white Christmas right at the last minute,” said Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at Verisk Atmospheric and Environmental Research. “But most of the country will have a brown Christmas.”\n\nAmong the areas more accustomed to snowy Decembers is the Northeast, where a powerful storm blew in this week and dumped heavy rain on the region’s ski areas, wreaking havoc on the snowpack.\n\n“It didn’t wash out our trails. But it was crazy rain,” said Tom Day, the general manager of Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, New Hampshire.\n\nHe hiked the ski area Monday, when it was closed, as 3.5 inches (8.8 centimeters) of warm rain fell and the wind howled.\n\n“That’s a four-letter word, rain, in our business,” Day said.\n\nThe snow cover across the U.S. is at near-record lows for this time of year, said Cohen, who doesn’t expect much change by Christmas Day.\n\n“There is a storm that is supposed to come out of the Rockies and head toward Canada, so it looks like some fresh snow in the western Plains, from Kansas to North Dakota,” he said, adding that snow could fall as far west as Denver and as far east as Minnesota.\n\nThe National Weather Service also doesn’t foresee a white Christmas for much of the country. But on the bright side, “At least the weather is favorable for most people who have plans to travel this year,” the service wrote in its holiday forecast.\n\nSo where should snow lovers turn?\n\n“The best chance for a white Christmas by far is in Alaska,” the service wrote. “Anchorage’s record snow depth on Christmas Day is 30 inches (76 centimeters), which was set back in 1994, and this year’s snow depth could be close to the record.”\n\nClimate change is playing a role in diminishing Christmas snow, Cohen said, although he noted it remains a complicated picture, with extreme cold snaps and unusual weather events occurring.\n\n“Certainly, the globe is warming. Winters are getting shorter. Overall, they’re getting warmer,” Cohen said. “December, I’ve seen the strongest warming. So I feel like December really no longer qualifies as a winter month. The early-season skiing is becoming more and more challenging.”\n\nDespite the challenges, Northeastern snow lovers aren’t giving up. After closing for rain on Monday, Gunstock reopened Tuesday, while many other ski areas took a day or two longer to rebuild trails.\n\nRyan Sloan, who drove five hours from New York through “intense” rain on Monday to go snowboarding, said Gunstock’s trails on Tuesday weren’t as washed out as he feared they would be.\n\n“The conditions are actually pretty good,” Sloan said. “When you get up to the top, the trails are pretty decent. There are some rocky spots, some icy spots, but overall, pretty good.”\n\nExtensive drainage systems allowed the resort to keep its trails intact, Day said.\n\nIn Vermont, the rain caused ski areas to lose some of their natural snow and close some trails, said Bryan Rivard, a spokesperson for Ski Vermont. But he said cold nighttime temperatures forecast for late this week would help them recover.\n\n“Vermont ski areas have some of the most powerful and efficient snowmaking systems in the world, which allows them to stockpile and distribute snow quickly,” Rivard said in an email.\n\nIn the Rockies, ski areas have been struggling to open lifts and trails on meager early-season snow. Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado, for instance, currently has about 30% of its terrain open, while Mammoth Mountain in California has 48 of its 176 trails open.\n\nAnd in Eagan, Minnesota, organizers called off the 2024 Minnesota Ice Festival, which had been scheduled to open Jan. 5. The event was going to feature an ice-skating rink, ice slide and a huge ice maze at the Minnesota Vikings’ headquarters, but the warm weather made it risky, Minnesota Ice CEO Robbie Harrell said in a statement.\n\nThe good news for Northeast snow lovers is they might not need to wait long after Christmas for fresh powder. Cohen said the weather should get colder just before New Year’s Day and into the first week of January.\n\n“So, new year, hopefully new fortunes as far as snow goes here in the eastern U.S.,” Cohen said.",

        "articleBody": "Commentators have long asked where Ukraine's reply is to the Iranian-made Shahed drones used by Russia . Now a new type of long-range strike drone from Ukraine is starting to hit Russian forces. New images from Ukraine show attacks being launched with new AQ-400 Scythe kamikaze drones made by Terminal Autonomy; the makers confirm that they have carried out strikes but cannot comment on details.\n\nThe company was founded by a multinational team and already mass produces loitering munitions for Ukraine. The company’s vision is to democratize airpower with large numbers of low-cost, mass-produced attributable autonomy. Under a new contract, they are now delivering Scythe drones – currently starting at 50 a month but scaling up rapidly to around 500 a month by Q2 2024.\n\n“Our goal is to produce 1,000 units monthly,” cofounder Francisco Serra-Martins told Forbes. “But it is not realistic to scale in just one quarter.”\n\nCheap, Numerous And Deadly\n\nTerminal Autonomy describes their AQ-400 Scythe as a “no frills, cost effective payload delivery system.” The compact design has two sets of wings, one forward and one rear, which provide maximum lift for minimum wingspan and enable 30 fully-assembled Scythes to be stacked in one shipping container for transport.\n\nThe drone’s body is made of milled sheets of plywood from a network of furniture factories, which the makers say is more scalable for mass production than 3D printing or using materials such as fiberglass. It is designed to be produced without skilled labor so that volume can be easily ramped up without lengthy technical training.",

        "title": "Half Of High School Seniors Won’t Apply To Colleges Costing More Than $40,000",
        "authors": "Emma Whitford",
        "date": "2023-11-07",
        "articleBody": "With Americans again struggling to repay $1.6 trillion in student debt (second only to mortgage debt), high school seniors (and their parents) are becoming increasingly price sensitive in their college search. For private colleges that have long relied on a combination of high sticker prices, offset by big financial aid packages, this could be a problem.\n\nIn a new survey of current high school seniors registered on the Niche.com college search and review site, 89% said a school’s published price would affect the likelihood they’ll apply or inquire about that school, up from 76% of last year’s seniors who said this. (While the survey is a self-selected sample, it’s a large one, with 24,000 teens completing the survey this year.)\n\nEven more dramatic: 59% of the 89% who described themselves as price sensitive—in other words, 53% of all seniors—said they flat out wouldn’t consider a school that costs more than $40,000 per year in total. Private colleges, on average, charged $41,540 in tuition alone for the 2023-24 academic year, up 4% from the year before, per the latest numbers from the College Board. Concern about prices goes along with growing doubts among Niche users that they’ll be able to pay for college—fewer than a quarter now say they’re confident they can afford college.\n\nVery, very few students pay the listed tuition price at the private college they attend. Instead, the colleges offer students financial aid packages that steeply discount the tuition through merit- and need-based institutional grants. As tuition rises, so does financial aid; during the 2022-23 academic year, students paid an average of only 49% of a college’s published price, according to numbers from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.\n\nBut the list price is posted on the college’s website and that figure can scare off prospective students who don’t know how private colleges’ opaque pricing structure works. “List price matters, particularly for students attending under-resourced [high] schools where college advising can be hit or miss,” says Bob Massa, principal and cofounder of Enrollment Intelligence Now, a college consulting firm. Forty-eight percent of Niche survey respondents said they preferred to get information from their school or college counselor, and this was even more true for traditionally underserved students. If their high school counselor doesn’t know (or doesn’t have time to explain) average net price, the student could remain in the dark.\n\nPrivate college officials are quick to brush aside the sticker price and steer students instead to the institutions’ net price calculators, which allows prospective applicants to get an estimate of their actual out-of-pocket costs. Colleges whose students receive federal financial aid are required to offer such calculators. But the sticker price is what pops up in a quick Google search, and a student’s estimated net price is hidden behind a form that requires students to input information they might not even know, including their parents’ salaries, cash in their bank accounts and sometimes even their mortgage and 401(k) balances. Some tools also ask for a student’s grade point average and standardized test scores to factor in possible merit scholarships.\n\n“Colleges tend to shy away from promoting net price, because the average grant or scholarship is just that—an average. An individual could receive more or less than that amount—there is no hard and fast number for the price a specific individual will pay,” Massa says. “It takes time to explain net price to students and parents—time that schools simply do not have,” if prospective students will not even investigate an expensive college. He recommends that colleges push the net price calculator in all of their marketing to prospective students. “A ‘You can afford X University’ campaign based on net price paid by different groups of students would help land applications from those who are scared away by the list price,” he adds.\n\nA handful of private colleges have executed tuition resets through which they publicly slash their sticker price (and quietly lower their financial aid packages to match) in order to draw in students that might have otherwise ruled them out as too expensive. For example, Bridgewater College, a liberal arts school in Virginia with about 1,400 undergraduates, cut its tuition by 62% in August, from $40,300 to $15,000.\n\n“The original purpose of tuition discounting was to make higher education affordable to low-income students,” Bridgewater president David W. Bushman said in a press release explaining the dramatic shift. “But over time, the practice has resulted in higher and higher tuition sticker prices that bear little resemblance to the actual cost of education. We’re now discouraging the many students and families whom the system was designed to attract. Worse yet, at a national level, we’re undermining the notion that a college education is worth the price.”\n\nWartburg College in Waverly, Iowa also reset its tuition price in August, from $48,490 to $25,000. Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey (ranked #461 on Forbes’ Top Colleges list), and Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania (ranked #351) are among the many colleges that have tried to slash their prices to draw in wary students. For colleges that recruit most of their students regionally and that do not have national name recognition, tuition resets do lead to an increase in applications over five years, according to research from Kennedy & Company, a higher education consulting firm, that examined the outcomes of tuition resets at 72 colleges between 2012 and 2019.\n\nThat said, resets don’t make sense for every college. A school is unlikely to significantly cut their tuition if they enroll a significant number of students who pay full price, Massa says. “Especially if universities have more than a handful of ‘full payers’ who receive no institutional financial aid support, a lowering of tuition will have a significantly negative impact on net revenue,” he adds. That’s why you likely won’t see colleges with swelling applicant pools and strong name recognition—think the Ivy League schools, Amherst College, Stanford University, the University of Southern California—slashing their list prices anytime soon.\n\nMoreover, many students and parents, particularly from affluent families, are still susceptible to “prestige pricing,”—a marketing idea that if a product, service or college costs more, it must be of a higher quality or reputation. Four in ten students say that a college’s brand or name recognition matters to their decision making, according to the Niche survey. Affluent students were even more likely to say this. “I believe that a good brand name is imperative to getting a high-quality job,” one survey respondent offered.\n\nThe model of a high price, combined with steep discounts, has been dominant at private colleges for decades. It’s unclear how many schools might follow the handful which have abandoned that model.",

        "articleBody": "This year, once again, music fans didn't wait until the days leading up to December 25 to listen to Christmas songs. So, who are they listening to?\n\nEvery year, music lovers get into the holiday spirit by listening to some of the season's top tracks. They tend to turn to iconic Christmas artists, whose names Spotify reveals in a new series of music rankings.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the title of Queen of Christmas goes to Mariah Carey. The American superstar owes this to her cult song, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" This catchy track, released in 1994 on the album \"Merry Christmas,\" tops Spotify's chart of the most popular Christmas songs worldwide.\n\nThe King of Christmas is none other than Michael Bublé. The Canadian crooner wins this title thanks to his album, \"Christmas.\" This 2011 release set a new record on the platform as the most streamed Christmas album of all time.\n\nBing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Ariana Grande also top the list of most-listened-to holiday artists.\n\nChristmas is a time for nostalgia, when many people listen to music linked to memories of childhood or adolescence. Spotify's year-end charts reflect this trend, with many tracks from the '90s, '80s and even '50s. These include Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" (1984), Brenda Lee's \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" (1958) and Bobby Helms' \"Jingle Bell Rock\" (1957). \n\nThis year, once again, music fans didn't wait until the days leading up to December 25 to start listening to Christmas songs. Spotify claims that peak listening for tracks celebrating the end-of-year festivities was reached on November 26 worldwide. This shows just how much music helps people to get into the Christmas spirit.\n\nFurthermore, Sunday is the day of the week when Spotify users listen to the most festive music. Perhaps this is because these upbeat tracks have a positive effect on their morale, helping to motivate them for the week ahead.",

        "articleBody": "Production-linked incentives (PLIs) and the Semicon India Programme are providing a push for global investments, while focus on MSMEs, smaller companies and domestic investments can help drive growth further.\n\nShifting the spotlight on India, Apple finally opened the doors for Indian consumers with its first retail stores in the financial and national capitals. But Apple CEO Tim Cook’s visit in April also brought a lot of cheer because of plans to diversify the supply chain away from China. It took a pandemic and geopolitical unrest for the Cupertino-based company to realise the need to ramp up production in other parts of the world. Apple dominates the luxury phone market in India, holding 63 percent of the market share in this category. But it holds only 6 percent of the market share in the overall smartphone segment.\n\nApple and its suppliers aim to build more than 50 million iPhones in India annually within the next two to three years. It’s biggest supplier, Foxconn, is already expanding manufacturing and spearheading the production shift for Apple by setting up more plants in different parts of India. On December 12, the Taiwan-based tech giant received approval from the Karnataka government for an additional investment of Rs 13,911 crore in its upcoming facility in Bengaluru Rural District. It had already received approval to invest Rs 8,000 crore earlier this year.\n\nIn the meantime, work is underway on Foxconn's manufacturing facility, located on 300 acres of land near Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru. In May, Hon Hai Precision Industry acquired the land for Rs 300 crore. Production at this plant will commence in April 2024. Recognised for assembling around 70 percent of global iPhones and known as the largest contract manufacturer globally, Foxconn’s manufacturing targets for the plant include one lakh units of iPhones by December 2025, 50 lakh units by December 2026, one crore by December 2027, and two crores by December 2028.\n\nRecently, the Tata Group became the first Indian company to make Apple iPhones after it acquired a full stake in Wistron. The company is reportedly working towards establishing one of India's largest iPhone assembly plants in Tamil Nadu, and it is expected to exceed the scale of the acquired Wistron plant in Karnataka, which employs over 10,000 people.\n\nLaunched in 2020, production-linked incentives (PLIs) have incentivised key suppliers of Apple, such as Foxconn and Pegatron, to intensify their presence in India. This has led to a significant increase in iPhone assembly in the country, surpassing $7 billion in the previous fiscal year and capturing approximately 7 percent of the device's global production share. \n\nA push for semiconductor manufacturing\n\nIndia's large population and maturing economy have witnessed a notable surge in electronics consumption in recent years. The Indian semiconductor market is expected to reach $55 billion by 2026, more than 60 percent of which will be driven by smartphones and wearables, automotive components, computing, and data storage. The majority of the demand in the Indian semiconductor market is currently met by imports. In order to reduce this dependency, the Government of India has approved the Semicon India Programme with an initial financial outlay of Rs 76,000 crore for the development of a sustainable semiconductor and display ecosystem in India.\n\nDuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s US visit in June this year, amid the multiple pacts signed between both countries, the joint development of technologies in the area of semiconductors was one of the highlights. US President Joe Biden and Modi signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Semiconductor Supply Chain and Innovation Partnership with the objective of coordinating semiconductor incentive programmes in India and the US.\n\nSubsequently, US chipmaker Micron Technology announced that it would invest up to $825 million to build a semiconductor assembly and test facility in Gujarat, taking advantage of the fiscal support being extended by the Indian government. This was followed by investment announcements from Applied Materials and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). \n\nFoxconn has also recently submitted an application to establish a semiconductor fabrication unit in India. This comes after its exit from a joint venture with the Vedanta Group, which had plans to set up a chip plant in Gujarat with an investment of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Despite this, Foxconn remains bullish.\n\nReportedly, even Tata Group is planning to set up a semiconductor processing plant in Assam with an investment of about Rs 40,000 crore, according to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. Another Indian conglomerate, Murugappa Group, has announced getting into semiconductor assembly and testing. The Chennai-based company would invest $791 million over five years in the business. The company has filed an application with the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY) seeking subsidies for an outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) facility in India.\n\nNext decade\n\nAccording to experts, India cannot solely rely on global investments and it is critical to look at domestic sources of financing and leverage the multiplier effect of money. Nilaya Varma, co-founder of Primus Partners, a management consulting firm, points out that global partnerships are necessary for India to recover lost time and expertise, but it’s important to look at the structures of doing it so that there is no over-reliance on foreign investments. “Manufacturing is surely important, and more so because India clearly missed this leg of the transition when moving up the food chain from an agriculture-driven economy to a service-driven economy directly. However, manufacturing needs to be looked at from the perspective of creating jobs, creating self-reliance in critical areas, and driving the same by leveraging domestic investments,” says Varma adding that it is therefore important to focus on the smaller companies and MSMEs because, through them, the growth will be driven multiple times more across the above areas. “This decade is going to be critical for the coming few decades, and hence investments in more value-added manufacturing are more important than just run-of-the-mill build-to-print work.\"\n\nWhat is coming next is going to be multiple times more evolutionary than what was there a decade ago. One could also go ahead and suggest that Moore's law (which says that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years) is possibly being redefined. Technology is evolving at a much faster rate. What is \"in\" today may as well be \"out\" in even a year’s time, adds Varma.",

About 3,067 vehicles would be inspected as a result.\n\nLast month, Toyota recalled 1.9 million RAV4 SUVs over concern their batteries could shift and catch fire.",

        "articleBody": "Rex Heuermann is charged in three of the 11 Long Island, NY murders\n\nEx-escort-turned-hairdresser Nikkie Brass revealed what it was like to date the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer, Rex Heuermann. \n\n\"As soon as he started talking about the Gilgo Beach killings, he stood up straighter. He leaned on the table. He got a smirk on his face. He almost seemed excited, like, he had been waiting the whole dinner to talk about this,\" she told FOX Nation in the new, \"Architect of Death\" special.\n\nGILGO BEACH MURDER VICTIMS FORGOTTEN DURING YEARS OF CORRUPTION AND SCANDAL\n\nFormer FBI agent and profiler James Fitzgerald told FOX Nation that Heuermann wanted to know what the police knew about him and to get \"as much information as he could.\" Additionally, retired NYPD inspector Paul Mauro said serial killers \"dine out on\" notoriety. They want to increase their attention and image publicly. \n\nBrass told FOX News co-host Emily Compagno in the special that her gut told her to \"get out of there.\" She texted a friend, \"I think this is the Gilgo Beach killer,\" and had her friend meet her to leave safely.\n\nThe Gilgo Beach serial killings were the known murders, often of sex workers, between 1996 and 2011, where 11 people were found buried in the Long Island, NY beach. Heuermann is the only known suspect charged with three victims’ murders. However, Brass claims there might be more people involved. \n\nBrass told FOX Nation that Heuermann named other people in connection with the killings on their date. She said he speculated about \"parties\" where five people would pick their \"favorite escort\" and kill her.  \n \nBrass said their discussion about the murders seemed like \"somebody who was reliving it, not somebody who was just a fan talking about it.\" \n\nCONVICTED KILLER DANIEL PELOSI CLAIMS HE CAN PROVE HE IS THE FALL GUY IN 2001 MURDER OF FINANCIER TED AMMON\n\nIn the FOX Nation special, Fitzgerald said Heuermann planned the killings \"very well\" and likely looked for women who would not be quickly reported missing. Echoing this, Brass said Heuermann told her prostitutes \"didn’t have anyone who cared about them.\" \n\nGILGO BEACH SUSPECT REX HEUERMANN BACK IN COURT AS ESTRANGED WIFE SAYS CHILDREN 'CRY THEMSELVES TO SLEEP'\n\nHeuermann, 59, was arrested in July of this year. He is charged with the murders of three women and is the prime suspect of killing another in connection with the Gilgo Beach killings. \n\nIt was reported this week that recent court filings reveal he had more than 50 illegal weapons stashed in his Long Island home in Massapequa Park. The weapons reportedly included more than two dozen handguns and 15 assault weapons, all of which were unregistered. \n\nAccording to the New York Post, the 50 illegal weapons accounted for not even 20% of Heuermann's massive collection, as he had upwards of 300 total firearms in his possession. \n\nHeuermann has two adult children, and his wife filed for divorce after being \"blindsided\" by her husband's arrest.",

        "articleBody": "University of Idaho student murders trial could begin this summer.\n\nIdaho prosecutors have asked for students stabbing suspect Bryan Kohberger's quadruple murder trial to take place over six weeks this summer, with shortened hours and no extra time for the defendant to come up with an alibi.\n\nLatah County's senior deputy prosecuting attorney, Ashley Jennings, filed the four-page request Thursday morning, days after the judge rejected the 29-year-old Kohberger's attempts to dismiss the indictment against him. It became publicly available later in the day.\n\nBRYAN KOHBERGER'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS IDAHO MURDERS INDICTMENT DENIED\n\nProsecutors want the trial scheduled while school is out for local high school students and the victims' classmates at the University of Idaho on the edge of town, reasoning that a summer trial would alleviate concerns about parking and pedestrian safety with the local high school next to the courthouse.\n\nA trial with the university out of session would leave more room in hotels for people visiting town for the proceedings, Jennings argued.\n\nThe University of Idaho's academic calendar shows next year's spring semester ends in the second week of June.\n\nJennings also asked the court for shortened days, from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. P\n\nBRYAN KOHBERGER TRIAL: MOTHER OF IDAHO MURDER VICTIM FIGHTS TO KEEP KING ROAD HOUSE INTACT\n\n\"For a trial of this length, it is appropriate to afford jurors some amount of time to tend to their personal affairs,\" the filing reads. \"Additionally, having more time in the afternoon allows for better preparation by the parties and allows for reasonable opportunities and time for the Court and counsel to address any motions or other matters that routinely arise during the course of jury trials.\"\n\nJennings also asked District Judge John Judge to set key pretrial deadlines, including for discovery, expert disclosures, witness lists and pretrial motions.\n\nThe prosecution also asked the judge not to extend Kohberger's deadline for providing notice of his alibi.\n\n\"The State submits that the Defendant has already been afforded this opportunity and the Court heard argument on the motions relating to such,\" Jennings wrote. \"The State submits the opportunity for the Defendant to disclose an alibi and notify the State of the same has passed and asks that the Court not reopen this issue.\"\n\nKohberger's defense wrote in court filings over the summer that the murder suspect had a habit of driving around alone in the middle of the night.\n\n\"Often he would go for drives at night,\" the filing reads. \"He did so late on November 12 and into November 13, 2022. Mr. Kohberger is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr. Kohberger was at each moment of the hours between late night November 12, 2022 and early morning November 13, 2022. He was out, driving during the late night and early morning hours.\"\n\nKohberger is accused of entering a six-bedroom house on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, around 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022 and killing four students inside.\n\nThe victims were Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21; and Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20.\n\nTwo others in the house survived, including one who heard crying and saw a masked man with \"bushy eyebrows\" leave out the back door.\n\nPolice found a knife sheath under Mogen's body that they say had Kohberger's DNA on it. Authorities also cited phone records and surveillance video showing Kohberger's white Hyundai Elantra in a probable cause affidavit last year.\n\nAt the time of the murders, Kohberger was studying for a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University, just 10 miles from Moscow, Idaho.\n\nJudge Judge entered not guilty pleas on Kohberger's behalf at his arraignment in May. He could face the death penalty if convicted.",

        "articleBody": "Hot off the heels of sharing the first images from the Fallout TV show, Amazon has now released the first trailer for the upcoming live-action adaptation of the popular video game franchise. The teaser showcases post-apocalyptic California and the ghoulish, irradiated mutations that can be found within it.\n\nIt also introduces the main characters of the series, transfers viewers into a distinctly Fallout-flavored world, and more or less brings the game to life. While the series, from executive producer Jonathan Nolan (Westworld), is not based on any specific game, it is an original and canonical story in Fallout lore.\n\nStill, while we aren't visiting locations from the games (don't expect them to wind up at the Washington Monument as we know it from Fallout 3, for instance), there are plenty of nods to the games. From the general aesthetic, the music, the types of characters and creatures and so much more, it's clear this is aiming to be a faithful take on the world of Fallout.\n\nWe put on our superfan hats to document all of the nods, Easter eggs, and more to the gaming franchise. Take a look and sound off in the comments to tell us what we missed!\n\nFallout premieres April 24 on Prime Video.\n\n1. Welcome to Vault 33\n\nA key element that sets Fallout apart from other post-apocalyptic media are the Vaults; underground bunkers scattered across the United States to save what little of humanity they can, each conducting a different social experiment on its inhabitants. For example, Vault 101 in Fallout 3 was designed to prevent its inhabitants from ever leaving. This trailer heavily showcases Vault 33. We are still unsure of the Vault’s unique experiment, and there is also a possibility that other Vaults will be featured in the show.\n\n2. Leaving the Vault\n\nThe player character leaving the Vault is an iconic moment in any of the Fallout games, and the show seems to be replicating that as its protagonist Lucy (Ella Purnell) takes her first steps into an irradiated Los Angeles. It seems at least one of her fellow Vault dwellers isn’t too happy with her leaving, as they call out for her to stop as she exits.\n\n3. Sunny Los Angeles\n\nThe Fallout games have been set in some of America’s largest cities; Fallout 3 in Washington D.C., Fallout 4 in Boston. As previously mentioned, the Fallout show will take place on the west coast in the city of Los Angeles. In this shot, we see what remains of the Santa Monica pier. Yes, we still want to ride the ferris wheel.\n\n4. Radroaches\n\nWhile you fight many human factions in the Fallout games, you also have to face off against mutations that have been irradiated by the fallout of nuclear war. None of them are as abundant, or annoying, as the radroach, and this shot confirms the show will be featuring these pesky critters as well.\n\n5. Hey, Michael Emerson\n\nOur first look at a character played by Michael Emerson, best known for playing iconic TV show villain Ben Linus from Lost. We don’t know who Emerson will be playing, but at this moment, they are warning Lucy to return back to Vault 33, and are concerned that she is unprepared for life on the surface.\n\n6. Son of Dogmeat?\n\nIn the Fallout games, the player can bring along companions that they meet on their journey to help face the horrors of the Wasteland. One of the most beloved is Dogmeat, the name of the dog companion that can travel alongside you. In Fallout 4, the Dogmeat’s breed is german shepherd, which is the same breed as the dog featured here munching on a radroach.\n\n7. Vertibirds\n\nThe vertibird is a gunship utilized by the Brotherhood of Steel, a zealous faction in the Fallout World that we see plenty more of later in the trailer. The music that starts playing in this shot, I Don’t Want To See Tomorrow by Nat King Cole, is indicative of the iconic design of Fallout’s world. While the games are predominantly set in the late 2200s, and even armageddon occurs in the future in 2077, the culture and technology of that time was frozen in the mid 20th century. That is primarily because in the Fallout universe, the transistor is never invented, so the world is perpetually stuck in the atomic era.\n\n8. Brotherhood of Steel\n\nHere we see Aaron Moten’s Maximus. Maximus is a squire in the aforementioned Brotherhood of Steel which, as his position suggests, is heavily rooted in a medieval mentality. Maximus then turns to look at a Brotherhood soldier wearing power armor, another iconic element of Fallout. There are several iterations of power armor, but all the sets we see in the trailer are the T60 model.\n\n9. Back in Vault 33\n\nIt seems as if all hell is set to break loose in Vault 33. Whether this is before or after Lucy leaves the Vault, or how connected this is to the vault’s social experiment, is unclear, but it does seem that we’re going to see a lot of the Vault itself and its residents.\n\n10. The Ghoul is here\n\nLucy steps into a human outpost on the surface, cobbled together with scraps, including the hull of an airplane. It then cuts to the ground level of that same outpost, and we get our first look at The Ghoul (Walton Goggins). Ghouls in Fallout are mutated humans that have retained their humanity, but what’s interesting is that Goggins’ character doesn’t have a proper name yet. Whether this is a Mandalorian-type situation, or Goggins’ character’s identity is being purposefully hidden, is unknown at this point. We do know a bit about his life before the bombs, which you can read about below.\n\n11. What happened to this guy?\n\nThis doesn't look like Overseer Hank (Kyle MacLachlan). Whoever it is, though only has one eye. Was he exposed to radiation? Is this part of the Vault's social experiment? Is this actually a different Vault? Clearly, something is going on. But we're going to have to wait to see what is happening.\n\n12. Mister Handy\n\nA robot wheels Lucy on a gurney as she passes an advertisement for Dairy Fresh ice cream. In Fallout, these floating robots are known as Mister Handy, a couple of which can become companions in Fallout 4.\n\n13. Overseer Hank\n\nHere we see Overseer Hank, the leader of Vault 33. This shot has, “I’m trapped in a room that’s about to flood with radiation and I can’t get out lest you get irradiated too,” all over it. Classic.\n\n14. Yao Guai\n\nThe Brotherhood of Steel is under attack, and a mutated bear, known in Fallout as a Yao guai, gets its claws on a downed soldier.\n\n15. Wanamingo\n\nThis isn’t a Super Mario Bros. Piranha Plant. This seems to be an updated design to the mutant creature known as the wanamingo. And yes, the mouth does look like it's filled with fingers for some reason.\n\n16. Is that the Prydwen?\n\nBrotherhood of Steel members look up at a flight of vertibirds and a bigger airship. Considering that the show takes place 9 years after the events of Fallout 4, this could potentially be the Prydwen, the Brotherhood’s airship featured in that game and what is understood to be the last pre-war airship in existence.\n\n17. Meet Cooper Howard\n\nA pre-ghoulified Walton Goggins is shown here. We know that before the boms fell, his name was Cooper Howard. But we don't know much about it. Still, it's clear that the show is going to flash back to when the nuclear bombs fall, as you can see downtown Los Angeles crumbling in the background.",

        "authors": "Jessica Choi",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "Meghan Markle has been in the public eye since she gained fame as Rachel Zane in \"Suits,\" and she became even more famous after being linked to Prince Harry. Now, as the Duchess of Sussex, she's become one of the biggest public figures imaginable: a British royal. However, Markle is also known for her fresh-faced beauty. She's typically seen wearing a barely there makeup look, but on some occasions, she's known to rock smokey eyes. \n\n\"For events ... I love a strong eye and a really light lip. I love contoured and highlighted cheekbones too,\" the duchess told Makeup.com in 2018. However, you'll rarely see her with dark lipstick. \"I always do a nude lip. If you ever see me on the carpet with a dark lip, I was strong-armed into doing it! I love the way it looks on other people — but it makes me nervous so I don't take that risk as often,\" she added.\n\nMany have tried to recreate Markle's laidback makeup, especially after she shared her simple daily routine with Allure, which includes a touch of highlighter, blush, mascara, and lip balm. \"That's my favorite kind of look,\" she told the outlet. Markle's go-to blush is the ever-popular Orgasm from NARS, and her favorite foundation is a TikTok fave (Dior Backstage Face & Body Foundation). Finally, for a slightly more dramatic nighttime look, Markle prefers to play up her eyes with a gold-brown liner. With her glowing skin, Markle isn't afraid to be seen sans makeup, and, unsurprisingly, she's still a natural beauty without any products on her face.\n\nMeghan Markle showed off her perfect skin\n\nMeghan Markle bared it all for her Netflix documentary series \"Harry & Meghan,\" including her face. In the docu-series, which premiered on December 8, 2022, Markle is seen sitting on a bed with a towel over her hair and her face scrubbed clean of any makeup, and it's clear to see that she doesn't look that different from her everyday look. To keep her skin looking fresh and dewy, Markle goes for regular beauty treatments, and according to her esthetician, Sarah Chapman, she's a big fan of facial massages and oils \n\nMeghan Markle's freckles are adorable\n\nA September 18, 2009, photo of Meghan Markle shows that she's always loved the natural look and embraced her freckles. She once told Allure that she despises having them airbrushed out of pictures, saying, \"For all my freckle-faced friends out there, I will share with you something my dad told me when I was younger: 'A face without freckles is a night without stars.'\" As such, you'll rarely see a picture of Markle with her freckles covered. This was especially true during her 2009 visit to the DPA Pre-Emmy Gift Lounge at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, but even her wedding-day glam was a no-makeup makeup look that didn't over-cover her skin.\n\nMeghan Markle's low-key look for an interview\n\nEven when she's on camera, Meghan Markle prefers to keep her face almost bare. For instance, while she did have a touch of mascara on in an ITV News interview from October 2019, she still sported a mostly undone look. This allowed her full brows and high cheekbones to shine, with her naturally pink lips also being on full display. Of her lip-care routine, she told Beauty Banter (via Hello! Magazine) that she uses Sugar Advanced Therapy Lip Treatment by Fresh to get a super soft pout. \"I have searched high and low and tried every kind of lip balm, but this is the very best,\" she stated.\n\nMeghan Markle prefers little-to-no foundation\n\nBack when she starred in \"Suits,\" Meghan Markle stated to Beauty Banter (via Today) that she skips foundation when she's off-camera and prefers an illuminating primer to make her skin look lit from within. The one beauty step Markle always makes time for is curling her lashes. According to her \"Suits\" makeup artist, Markle uses Maybelline's Lash Sensational Luscious Mascara for long, thick lashes (via Hello! Magazine). Her simple, nearly makeup-free look was on full display on January 14, 2012, when she stopped by the HBO Luxury Lounge featuring L'Oréal Paris and New Era Cap to commemorate the year's Golden Globes ceremony.\n\nMeghan Markle often steps out with minimal makeup\n\nWhen Meghan Markle's out and about, all eyes are on her, but she still opts for a minimal look when it comes to her makeup and hair. She's often spotted with barely there eye makeup and a breezy low bun, and this includes her October 28, 2018, trip to New Zealand's Wellington War Memorial. On her glam, makeup artist Daniel Martin shared with Allure, \"I don't use foundation all over her face ... I just spot-treat.\" Ultimately, Markle mainly sticks to her tried-and-true natural look, and it undoubtedly works for the duchess.",

        "articleBody": "Whether you tend to whip it out in spring or prefer to make it your go-to in fall, a lightweight trench coat is the kind of reliable piece that is simply timeless. Indeed, over the years, everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Kate Middleton has worn one. One reason for their enduring popularity is the fact that it suits pretty much everyone and can be timeless in seemingly endless ways. It's also the kind of outwear that keeps you cozy while looking chic.\n\nFrankly, picking up a trench coat is a practical option thanks to the fact that it can be worn in various weather conditions including ones that aren't exactly pleasant. Indeed, the extra material at the structured shoulders, the collar, the buttons, and the belt can also work together to keep you warm when it is cold and dry or when it's rainy. Beyond that, a trench coat can be part of a casual ensemble or be worn with a more formal outfit. If that has piqued your interest, you may be interested in a few of our favorite ways to style a simple trench coat, like with everyday clothes.\n\nTrench coat with casual clothes\n\nWhen you think of an old-school trench coat, you might immediately imagine the kind of pressed piece that your grandpa would wear out to dinner. Of course, these days, the style has evolved, which is why it can be worn with much more than just a suit. For instance, you can pop one on with casual clothes. Think along the lines of a comfy T-shirt, loose-fitting jeans, and your favorite pair of sunglasses. Toss on some sneakers along with a crossbody purse, and you're ready for the day.\n\nTrench coat with leisurewear\n\nLeisurewear is both comfortable and stylish, which is something that can also be said of trench coats. That's why they work so well together, even if it's not a combination you have ever considered before. Try grabbing your coziest sweatpants, a warm hoodie, and sleek sneakers before slipping on your trench coat. Add a purse that's just as dressy as your trench but the same color as your hoodie (as well as your pants and shoes if they happen to match) to tie the entire look together.\n\nTrench coat with edgy items\n\nIf you like a rather traditional look, you might appreciate the fact that trench coats tend to be worn with classy outfits. However, if you want a contemporary twist, wear one with edgy items instead. That might be ripped denim jeans or faux leather pants. You might also want a mesh top or something that features metal accents. Pair your ensemble with mile-high stiletto heels and a fierce pair of bold sunnies, not to mention statement-making earrings and maybe even a necklace and bracelets to match.\n\nTrench coat with modern pieces\n\nYou may not think that a trench coat suits a contemporary style, but that's not the case at all. There are plenty of chic designs that embrace a newer look while staying true to the classic item. Think along the lines of a piece that switches things up when it comes to the material used, as well as the collar, belt, and placement of the buttons. On top of that, you can wear it along with modern pieces like boots that boast a bold pattern and a form-fitting black dress.\n\nTrench coat with classic items\n\nWhen thinking about ways to style your trendy trench coat, don't forget about classic options. Whether you're wearing pants and a top or a skirt, dress, or jumper, you might want to consider sticking with time-honored cuts and timeless lines. That's not to mention patterns that look just as good now as they did in the past, such as paisley, plaid, and houndstooth. Top off the entire look by trying something a little different and throwing your trench coat over your shoulders instead of slipping your arms into the sleeves.",

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nNew year, new wardrobe. The defining 2024 fashion trends are already taking shape just weeks into the year, courtesy of the spring runway shows and some boundary-pushing red-carpet looks—and just when we were starting to get tired of our current wardrobes. Nostalgia ruled last year’s biggest trends, from the revival of early-2010s fashion to so-called stealth wealth, which revisited ’90s-style minimalism. And experts say this year’s trends, like the disco decadence of sequins and the return of grade-school staples like bows and preppy polos, follow the same arc—but with a little more playfulness this time around.\n\n“I think if prices for luxury goods continue to remain as high as they currently are, we’ll see the ‘quiet luxury’ trend stick around for a bit longer,” says Emilia Petrarca, who writes the fashion newsletter Shop Rat. “It’s just too expensive to take risks on pieces that you might not like 5, 10 years down the line. Timeless pieces are perhaps a better investment.” Still, she doesn’t think we’re headed for a year of unexciting clothes: “People are interested in trying a timeless sort of elegance or opulence—not just a boring beige minimalism that’s perhaps safer.”\n\nOne safe bet: Secondhand fashion will continue to be hugely popular. But with Y2K pretty much kicked at this point, according to Jenny Walton, a Vogue contributor and writer of the newsletter Jenny Sais Quoi, it might be time to look even further back. “I’ve been waiting to see if there will be a sort of 1920s resurgence,” she says. In the meantime she (and seemingly everyone else on Instagram) has eyes for one dress in particular: “The only thing I’m focused on is how to get one of those flowing silk Prada dresses from the [spring] runway.”\n\nWondering what else will take off this year? We turned to our experts and editors to give you a preview into the most exciting 2024 fashion trends. From elevated activewear to sheer dresses, these are the wardrobe essentials to invest in now—before everyone else does.\n\nBows, Bows, Bows\n\nIf you were online in the last few months of 2023, you noticed that everything was covered in bows, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down in 2024. Fashion’s obsession with girlhood offers an escape from the demands of adult life: If you must pay taxes and go to the grocery store after work, at least you can look cute doing it. Dip your toes into the trend with bow accessories—they can adorn hair, earrings, statement tights, and even nails, if you’re taking cues from the spring runways—or go all in by investing in a piece that’s covered in ribbons.\n\nRomantic Rosettes\n\nAlong with bows, rosettes are another staple of girlcore that will be everywhere in 2024. They made an appearance on more spring runways than we could count, popping up on everything from ball gowns to button-down shirts. The easiest way to try the trend is with a hair tie, but we also recommend investing in a rosette-ified top, skirt, or wedding guest dress to add some welcome romance to your wardrobe.\n\nSequined Everything\n\nAnother repeated motif on the 2024 runways has been high shine—especially sequins. Once relegated to New Year’s Eve, paillettes are now showing up in looks destined both for the dance floor and the office. Why not make this your flashiest year yet? Channel your inner Studio 54 groupie with a sparkly statement dress or go a little more demure with a designer bag or ballet flats that’ll shine at your next event.\n\nPrep School\n\nMiu Miu’s spring runway was like an updated episode of Gossip Girl (or a peek at the students who were actually having fun in Saltburn), and tons of other brands featured models done up in neo-preppy styling. We’re excited to play with that relaxed, moneyed aesthetic by stocking up on striped button-downs, polo shirts, academic blazers, and anything with a Polo Ralph Lauren logo.\n\nNonbasic Basics\n\nStealth wealth is still going strong, but it’s poised to change a little in the new year. With ’90s luminaries like Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy—the late style icon and the subject of a new coffee-table book—clearly on the mood board, simple (yet glamorous) outfits are all the rage right now. “I believe we will move into an ’80s, ’90s look somewhat adjacent to quiet luxury,” Walton says. “Someone who dressed in a very simplistic and chic manner such as Bessette-Kennedy will continue to be a big inspiration. I also think that restraint will become more and more alluring.” Get a jump on minimalism with hardworking basics like high-waist jeans and long-sleeve T-shirts.\n\nC-Suite Chic\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) girlhood’s popularity in fashion right now, there’s a strong focus on office-ready aesthetics too. We’re expecting to see so much more power dressing in 2024, with a focus on monochromatic looks in shades of gray, black, and white. Channel your inner executive and pick up a tailored suit or some office-ready pumps, then pretend like you have your life in order.\n\nSheer Layering\n\nIf the many, many runway presentations featuring see-through clothing—among them Dior, Chanel, Hermès, and the Prada one Walton’s been dreaming about—are any indication, expect sheer to continue its reign on and off the red carpet. You don’t have to bare it all to give the trend a try; instead, pick up a dress with a sheer skirt, a top with slightly sheer inlay, transparent socks, or a mesh top you can layer over your swimsuit.\n\nXL Bags\n\nWe have Succession to thank for the name “ludicrously capacious bags,” but labels like Stella McCartney, Tibi, and Victoria Beckham to thank for adding them to their spring collections. Start doing your shoulder exercises now, then pick up an oversized designer bag from Tory Burch or Rebecca Minkoff before the rest of your group chat does.\n\nInto the Deep\n\n“Mermaidcore” had a major moment in 2023, and we aren’t headed for dry land just yet. Aquatic motifs like lobsters and dolphins bubbled up at Schiaparelli, Colin LoCascio, and Di Petsa, while other collections (like Mugler and Jason Wu) featured models that looked like marine life or well-dressed mermaids. You can get the look with Ariel-worthy tops and dresses, flowy skirts, and fisherman sandals.\n\n’80s Excess\n\nThe first runways of the year featured some very ’80s displays of self-expression; look at Moschino’s slinky, jewel-laden models, Luar’s Grace Jones–esque styling, and Louis Vuitton’s ode to material girls. You don’t need to raid your rich grandma’s closet to join in—just stock up on oversized shades, even bigger blazers, polka-dot dresses, and cap-toe slingbacks to bring the same over-the-top attitude to your current wardrobe.\n\nKitten Heels\n\nA wide variety of labels, from Prada to Rachel Comey and Vivienne Westwood, showed shockingly low heels for spring, meaning we’re in for a walking-friendly 2024. Buy into the comfortable heels trend now to stay ahead of the curve and give your feet a break.\n\nShades of Green\n\nIf you want to know what will move in after red’s big moment this winter, just look to the opposite end of the color wheel. “We’re always working with experts to gauge trends, and I’m betting on shades of green for 2024,” says Aya Kanai, the head of editorial and creative for shopping at Google. Spring’s runways included every shade of green imaginable—kelly, pistachio, grass, seafoam, you name it—and we love the fresh, verdant energy for the new year.\n\nSporty Spice\n\nSporty staples like track jackets, oversized hoodies, ringer tees, and baseball caps were a common sight on the year’s first runways, making the models look like the most stylish attendees of after-school practice. Even if you can’t remember the last time you stepped foot in a gym, you can still dress like a star player; just stock up on slouchy jackets, roomy track pants, and white sneakers.\n\nSummer in Capris\n\nAs seen on the Sandy Liang runway and celebs like Gigi Hadid and Jennifer Lawrence, capris are poised to make an unexpected comeback this year. Tastemakers like Petrarca are on board: “I’m buying leggings and ‘pedal pushers,’ big sunglasses, and flats [for 2024],” she says. Take your pick from cropped black leggings and culotte-like capris—we promise you’ll be ahead of the curve.",

        "articleBody": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nOn a recent coffee run in my New York City neighborhood, I decided to play a game with myself. If I saw less than three Lululemon Everywhere belt bags during the four-block walk, I would buy only a drip coffee. If I saw more than three, I would splurge on the oat milk latte.\n\nI saw seven.\n\nThe Everywhere bag certainly lived up to its name in 2023. Originally designed for Lululemon educators—a.k.a. sales associates—to carry their phones when working in the stores, they were so popular that they became an official part of the accessories collection in 2018. Priced at a sensible $38, the unassuming zip-around belt bag features a few interior pockets and is more often than not worn crossbody.\n\nIf you don’t have one, you know someone who does. Searches for the Lululemon belt bag went up an eye-popping 650% this year, according to Google, which featured the style in the 2023 Google 100, a curated list of gifts based on trending searches.\n\nBut its success isn’t a fluke—it's clearly indicative of a larger trend. In April, Uniqlo’s Round Mini Shoulder Bag was deemed the hottest product of 2023. A rep from Uniqlo told Glamour that the retailer has sold over one million pieces this year alone. (That’s right; it went platinum).\n\nThen in June The New York Times wrote about the sudden rise of Baggu, a decidedly not new and very affordable brand that’s become Gen Z’s tote of choice. The brand’s nontote offerings are equally coveted. Its collaboration with New York designer Sandy Liang instantly sold out, leading to TikTok blowback and feverish preorders for the second drop.\n\nThis was also the year celebrities surprisingly embraced bags by Aupen, a one-year-old label whose angular Y2K-inspired designs became a low-key status symbol despite being logo-free and mid-priced. Ranging from $120 to $340, the bags have been worn by the likes of Taylor Swift, Kylie Jenner, and Selena Gomez.\n\nThe Aupen bag Swift carried got a boost from TikTok, where just one video amassed nearly one million views. In fact, TikTok’s influence surrounding the rise of the attainable It bag can’t be overstated. In 2022 the Lululemon belt bag went viral on the platform, and it has regularly sold out ever since, according to the brand. Meanwhile, the hashtag #uniqlobag has generated more than 125 million views, with users sharing their styling techniques and “what’s in my bag?” rundowns.\n\nOf course, cheap bags can be found anywhere, anytime. So what gives these particular bags that viral special sauce? In a year when quiet luxury has reigned, minimalist design and discrete branding are selling points.\n\n“The luxury trends orbited around maximalism and logomania for several seasons,” says Aya Kanai, the head of editorial and creative for shopping at Google. “Then the turn to quiet luxury with brands like The Row and Khaite caused a trickle-down of contemporary priced handbags that leveraged clean design at lower prices.”\n\nAt the same time, there’s been a lack of novelty in the designer bag space in recent seasons. Instead people are digging into the archives. “Old bags are back,” Amanda Mull wrote in The Atlantic earlier this year. “A significant—and growing—number of fashion-conscious people appear to be mining the depths of their closets or scouring secondhand marketplaces for designs released in the past decade or so.”\n\nDesigners appear eager to feed the demand with reissued styles, too. See the Gucci horsebit chain shoulder bag and the Prada Re-Nylon 2000 Mini-Bag, both of which retail for well over $1,000. Baggu’s nylon shoulder bag, on the other hand, features a similar crescent shape to the Prada bag—for a mere $44.\n\nAlthough not everyone believes there’s been a complete lack of new high-end It styles as of late, the minimalist part of the equation still rings true.\n\n“I have been seeing The Row’s Margaux tote everywhere lately,” says Jess Graves, writer of The Love List, a shopping newsletter on Substack. The Row’s leather Banana Bag, which retails for $2,350, is also a favorite of TikTokers looking to emulate the Olsens’ signature aesthetic. Squint, and the Uniqlo bag is a solid dupe for roughly 1/20th the price.\n\nGraves concedes that cost and It factor aren’t mutually exclusive. “I don't think a bag has to live at a specific price point to be ‘It,’” she says. “I think ubiquity is a key factor, as is the buy-in from people we might see as aspirational, whether it’s a celebrity or just a cool girl on the street.”\n\nGraves points to the COS quilted bags—which start at $49 for a “micro” size—as achieving that status. “The COS bag has such mass appeal because it’s distinct enough to clock as a ‘thing’ but not a blatant knockoff of something else,” she says.\n\nBuy-in for the COS bag came from Blackpink’s Jennie—who wore a white version of the puffy bag in 2021. The style became a phenomenon, earning the nickname “the Jennie bag” and dupes of its very own. Several new colors followed, and it was reimagined in leather for the fall-winter 2023 collection.\n\nThe problem with any popular piece is that once an attainable It bag hits fever pitch, it starts to lose some of its appeal. (Think the omnipresent Amazon coat of 2019.)\n\nOf the COS bags, Graves says, “I think their ubiquity will date them, but for now it’s an affordable way to buy into a trend.”\n\nBut Kanai isn’t worried these bags will disappear just yet. “They will continue to be popular because of that mix of elevated design and accessible price point,” she predicts, adding that she personally has “several colors” of the Uniqlo shoulder bag. “It looks great with my more expensive clothing. And at under $20, why not have more than one color?”\n\nKanai’s question—while rhetorical—sent me on another quest. The next time I took the subway, I counted how many Uniqlo shoulder bags I spotted. After 11, I lost count.\n\nLindy Segal is a freelance lifestyle writer and editor whose work has appeared in Harper’s Bazaar, Fast Company, InStyle, and others.

        "title": "How Did Nu Metal Become the Hottest Thing in Fashion?",
        "authors": "Cassidy George",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "Korn has a sold-out Adidas collab. Marc Jacobs linked with Deftones for an entire collection. Somehow, the most reviled subgenre of the 2000s has found its way onto designer moodboards everywhere.\n\nAfter all the bizarre fashion collaborations we’ve seen over the past decade, I was convinced that nothing could surprise me anymore. And then, in late October, I learned that the nu metal band Korn—yes, the Freaks on a Leash themselves—had linked up with Adidas on a full-fledged capsule of apparel and footwear, including a tracksuit riddled with shiny purple sequins. To celebrate the collab’s release, the German sportswear giant even turned its Los Angeles flagship store into a temporary Korn exhibition—and just days after the drop, Adidas announced the collection had completely sold out. This was just the latest in a mounting pile of evidence that nu metal is more than merely relevant again. The genre is now something it’s never been before, even in its 2000s heyday: fashionable.\n\n\"The nu metal aesthetic feels like the alt version of the ’90s and early-aughts aesthetics that have been popular as of late, that have generally leaned more [towards] Paris Hilton party girl,\" said Sarah Rozansky, head creative at DONEGER I TOBE, a fashion consultancy that specializes in trend forecasting. \"Gen Z seems to be gravitating towards this darker aesthetic that marries back to a niche music community.”\n\nAdidas obviously did their market research: According to Google Trends, interest in nu metal is now higher than when they started tracking in 2004. The Y2K rock subgenre—associated with the likes of Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Deftones, System of a Down, Mudvayne, and Coal Chamber (most of whom ironically never identified with the “nu metal” label)—is as famous for its fusion of metal with pop and hip hop as it is for being deplored by critics. “It sucks that we all had to live through the dumbest trend in music history the first time, and it sucks even worse that we're being subjected to it again,” said Dan Ozzi, the veteran music writer and Sellout author, of nu metal's re-entry into pop cultural discourse.\n\nNu metal's resurgence has been percolating since the late 2010s, thanks to a generation of Soundcloud rappers and hyperpop artists allured by its lasting taboo. 100 Gecs, Poppy, Pink Pantheress, and Rico Nasty have all acknowledged nu metal as a musical influence, and the genre’s aesthetic legacy lives on in the horrorcore-inspired visuals of Playboi Carti, Doja Cat, and Trippie Redd. Longtime nu metal ambassador Lil Uzi Vert even released a cover of System of a Down's \"Chop Suey!\" on their recent album The Pink Tape. Sped-up remixes of tracks by bands like Deftones have helped transform nu metal into somewhat of a social media phenomenon on TikTok, particularly among young women. The brand Heaven by Marc Jacobs capitalized on this in March by releasing an extensive collaboration with the band. The genre also had a memorable presence on the soundtrack of Beef—one of 2023’s most popular Netflix shows—while Sick New World, a nu metal festival in Las Vegas, completely sold out in its inaugural year.\n\nWhile rock subgenres like punk, goth, and grunge bring immediate signifiers to mind, what constitutes nu metal fashion is slightly murkier. It does, however, have its distinguishing attributes––namely the fusion of traditional rock styles with sportswear, alongside influences from skateboarding, hip hop and rave culture. Think outrageous hair (frosted tips, colored dreads), impractical piercings, chains, mesh, and fur, blended with Adidas tracksuits, oversized sweats, chunky skate shoes, white tanks, gas station sunglasses, and massive pants by JNCO or Tripp NYC. Nu metal style isn't a monolith, but it often leaned toward dirty, chaotic graphics and a more relaxed, slack-chic take on alternative style. Many of these bands were known for signature looks, like Mudvayne's cyberpunk face makeup, Coal Chamber's outrageous braids, Slipknot's boiler suits and masks, Korn's customized Adidas and skirts, and Limp Bizkit’s backwards hats and khakis.\n\nThere are countless examples of early adopters of this look, like Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber (who made headlines for wearing JNCOs this summer), Machine Gun Kelly and NBA star Jordan Clarkson. Nu metal has also carved its way into the luxury sphere. My guess is that the filmmakers who made the competing documentaries about Woodstock 99 didn't expect to end up on high-fashion mood boards, but Balenciaga's infamous Spring 2023 show bore a curious resemblance to scenes from the catastrophic nu metal festival—mud pits, wallet chains, and all. The nu metal agenda is equally alive and well in recent collections by buzzy labels like Vetements, 017 Alyx 9SM, Willy Chavarria, Diesel, Y-Project, and No Faith. \"We're seeing a hardening of fashion aesthetics and a lot of darker tones and ugly color combinations,\" said Gwyneth Holland, a trend analyst at BDA London. \"There is a move toward anti-cool and post-perfection, which is about embracing things that are gross or weird. I personally love that people are challenging old ideas of good taste. Nu metal is like a counter-trend to quiet luxury.\"\n\nIn July, Travis Scott sported Limp Bizkit merch on Instagram and in his music video for \"K-POP\" with The Weeknd and Bad Bunny. His Utopia tour merch, which broke sales records, also looks remarkably Korn-y. Nu metal-inspired looks also lend themselves well to meme-able moments: Consider Sam Smith in a full Vetements look at the Barbie premiere, or even Robert Pattison's GQ cover last year. Brands like Praying and Barragán—famous for their provocative shirts adorned with phrases like \"Feral\" or \"J'Adore Ur Hole\"—bring to mind the boldness and crassness of nu metal bands and their merch (like Slipknot’s infamous “people = shit” shirt). After all, “trashion” and controversy––two things nu metal bands have always understood and mastered––are pillars of the sartorial zeitgeist in the age of algorithms. Holiday Kirk, a music journalist and the admin of the popular X account @numetal_moment, offered his take: “I’ve been perturbed lately that the music is getting a bit lost, suddenly it feels like more of a fashion thing. But of course, that’s part of the reason why these bands were so successful. They were like content farms before that concept even existed.”\n\nThe continuous churn of nostalgia-driven trends online has created a constant demand for looks and concepts that are more and more extreme. Nu metal's association among critics with crudity, violence, white male rage and general bad taste gives it an edge of provocation that genres like grunge and hip hop have long lost. On the surface, nu metal is the perfect amalgamation of aesthetics that are timelessly cool (metal, skateboarding, streetwear) and trendy (Y2K, rave). Its deeper cultural associations reflect the nihilism that has flourished among post-pandemic, post-woke mindsets.\n\nIs it really so surprising that people navigating life on a war-torn and decaying planet are resonating more with the brutal simplicity and absurdity of “Break Stuff” than they are the heady, textural soundscapes of Pink Floyd? \"People are trying to negotiate the endlessly awful and scary world we live in and that has morphed into a darker sense of humor,\" said Holland. \"Compared with other rock forms, nu metal didn't take itself terribly seriously. I think that's part of why it appeals to people right now.”",

        "articleBody": "On the latest episode of #GQShopTalk, we visit New York's landmark destination for grail-level Japanese menswear.\n\nWay back in the early 2000s, a nascent community of menswear enthusiasts started gathering online to talk about Italian tailoring, American workwear, and, above all else, Japanese denim. At the time, the blogosphere was crowded with fellas more than willing to navigate convoluted proxy channels to score a pair of jeans from the country that makes 'em best. So when Blue In Green opened the doors of its New York City outpost in 2006, it was greeted like a championship team returning home for the parade. Suddenly, SoHo had a one-stop-shop to service guys weaned on A.P.C. selvedge and eager to level up to the rarer stuff.\n\nFrom the outset, Blue In Green's roster of brands read like a starting lineup of Japanese heavy-hitters—Momotaro, Kapital, Pure Blue Japan—each one revered for its quality and mastery of old-school craftsmanship techniques. The store's floor-to-ceiling wall of denim quickly became a destination for a specific type of clothing obsessive, introducing a new generation of customers to the reinterpreted Americana distinct to Japan. If you're even peripherally aware of the country's reputation for excellence in the genre, you probably have Blue In Green to thank for it.\n\nWalk into Blue In Green's store on the cobblestoned corner of Greene and Canal, and you're greeted by an indigo-dyed American flag hanging above a record shelf at the end of a long, live-edge wooden table piled with accessories. Make your way towards the back corner and you'll find a short hallway that opens up into a solarium of selvedge, flanked by a stage with two massive vintage hi-fi speakers, a nod to the store's moniker, lifted from a Miles Davis tune of the same name.\n\nNew York City might be a retail mecca, but its pool of novel multi-brand boutiques is surprisingly shallow. You can't swing a glossy shopping bag without hitting a swanky flagship store; why would a third-party retailer stock a limited a portion of a designer's catalog when folks can go down the street to peruse the entire selection? In the context of its competition, Blue In Green's ongoing success—and commitment to spotlighting hard-to-find makers from across the globe—is only more impressive. You don't last in New York for nearly two decades unless you're doing a whole lot of things a whole lot of right.\n\nTo wit, the store's status as a pilgrimage site for denim purists remains, but the downtown fixture has also expanded its offering to include brands from its own backyard. Local upstarts like Small Talk Studio and Nothin' Special sit alongside homegrown labels like Glenn's Denim and Left Field NYC, a welcome reminder that Blue In Green is still very much a neighborhood haunt. Whether you wander in to buy your first pair of grail-level jeans or just stumble through the door seeking respite from SoHo's big-box retail landscape, the experience will be refreshing—and it's way cheaper than booking a ticket to Okayama.",

        "articleBody": "A student who says he barricaded his door just before the shooter tried the handle is among those describing the day when 14 people were shot dead in the Czech capital\n\n Student shoots 14 people dead at university in Prague\n\nWitnesses have described scenes of panic inside and outside Charles University after gunshots rang out in the heart of historical Prague on Thursday, sparking chaos and fear in an area bustling with locals and tourists.\n\nThe shooting began shortly after Jakob Weizman, a journalist and masters student at the university, arrived to sit an Albanian language exam. It was just him and the professor in the small room, he said. “And during the exam I heard gunshots and I heard screaming.”\n\nBoth of them froze, unsure what to do. “Eventually police started showing up and there were more gunshots and screaming.”\n\nWeizman locked the classroom door and the pair put up a makeshift barricade, frantically shoving tables, chairs and anything else they could find against the door.\n\n“I think the shooter went from inside of the faculty to the outside to the balcony where he was shooting on people from outside,” the 25-year-old told the Guardian. “There were people trying to escape over the ledge.”\n\nSeveral images showed what appeared to be students crouching on a ledge near the roof of the building, seemingly attempting to hide from the gunman. Police later said at least 14 people were killed and more than 20 injured.\n\nSoon after the barricade was in place, Weizman said he heard someone trying to open the door of the room he was in. “He was going through each classroom to see if people were there to shoot them,” he said. “We locked our door just five minutes before he tried to open our door.”\n\nHe and his professor remained in the room for about an hour, dialling up their loved ones and asking people to let police know they were trapped in room 309A.\n\nWeizman said: “I was just trying to tell people what was happening, calling my mom, calling my girlfriend. If it’s the end, trying to say what you can before – I don’t know. You’re never prepared for the situation.”\n\nAfter initially hearing “a lot” of shooting and screaming, things appeared to calm down for a bit. “And then there was a lot more shooting and screaming 30 minutes later.”\n\nEventually the pair were evacuated by police. “As we were walking out, there was just blood all over the faculty.”\n\nHours later a makeshift memorial sprouted up outside the university, with mourners lighting hundreds of candles outside the ornate main building.\n\nThe Czech president, Petr Pavel, expressed gratitude for the condolences and words of support that had poured in from around the world.\n\n“My thoughts are still with families of the victims, injured and those who had to fight for their lives at the Faculty of Arts,” he wrote on social media. “No one can imagine the fear and mental strain they went through yesterday.”\n\nAmong those who attended the impromptu vigil was student Kristof Unger. “[A] few of my friends study at the philosophy faculty at Charles University,” Unger told the Associated Press. “And they have been really traumatised by the shooting there and I just wanted to make them feel a little bit better.”\n\nThe university’s rector, Milena Králícková, was among the throngs of mourners who were lighting candles. “The academic community is shaken, deeply shaken,” she told the Associated Press.\n\nThe mass shooting – believed to be the worst in the Czech Republic’s modern history – unfolded across the river from the Prague Castle and a short walk from the Old Town, which ranks among Europe’s main tourist attractions.\n\nAs panic rippled through the area on Thursday, police vehicles and ambulances sped across the 14th-century Charles Bridge. In the city centre, where hours earlier throngs of people had been visiting the busy Christmas markets, officers emptied squares.\n\n“We heard loud gun shots,” tourist Joe Hyland, 18, from Truro, Cornwall, told the BBC. “But we didn’t think much of it until we heard people screaming, people running away, sirens. Then we thought this is serious.”\n\nAnother witness, Ivo Havranek, 43, initially dismissed the loud bangs, thinking it was a group of rowdy tourists or coming from a nearby movie set. “Then suddenly there were students and teachers running out of the building,” he told Reuters. “I went through the crowd not realising what is actually going on. I wasn’t ready to admit that something like that could happen in Prague.”\n\nOnly when he saw police officers carrying automatic rifles did he understand it was serious. “They shouted at me to run.”\n\nStudent Daniel Broz said he was across the river from the university when the shooting began. As the sound of gunshots filled the air, he had no idea what was going on. “And then a flurry of police cars passing by was absolutely surreal,” he told Reuters. “Especially as a Czech who has never witnessed an event similar to this before.”\n\nNewlyweds Tom Leese, 34, and Rachael, 31, were on their honeymoon and having a drink in the Slivovitz Museum, when a policeman came in and started shouting loudly. Police later explained in English there was an active shooter and everyone needed to stay inside and stay down, Leese told PA Media.\n\n“The staff were very calm, turned all the lights off very quickly and urged us to stay calm.” The couple, from Merstham in Surrey, were kept in the museum for more than an hour as sirens blared outside.\n\nPetr Nedoma, director of the Rudolfinum Gallery at a concert hall across Palach Square, told Czech TV he had seen the shooter. “I saw a young person on the gallery who had some weapon in his hand, like an automatic weapon, and shooting toward the Manes Bridge. Repeatedly, with some interruptions, then I saw as he shot, put his hands up and threw the weapon down on the street, it lay there on the pedestrian crossing,” he said.\n\nCzech police later described the gunman as a 24-year-old Charles University student who they believed may been influenced by similar shootings abroad. Police said on Friday that the gunman killed himself on the balcony of the university building as police officers approached him.\n\nIn the early hours of Friday, the scene of the shooting remained sealed off by police. Weizman said his next task was to recover the belongings he had left in the exam room when he was hurriedly evacuated.\n\nHe was bracing himself. “I don’t think I could ever set foot in the faculty again,” he said. “It never happened in 15 years of living in the US. But it happens for the first time in Czechia.”",

        "articleBody": "Two people injured as 20-metre high tree collapses next to Christmas market.\n\nA woman was killed and two people injured by a large Christmas tree that fell over during stormy weather in the Belgian town of Oudenaarde, authorities said on Friday.\n\nSecurity camera footage on Belgian news media showed a brightly lit 20-metre (66ft) high Christmas tree slowly leaning over, then collapsing next to a Christmas market in the town, east of Brussels, on Thursday as a merry-go-round turned in the historic market square.\n\nA spokesperson for the Oost-Vlaanderen province prosecutor said the victim was a 63-year old woman from Oudenaarde. Two women from the same town were lightly injured. “The investigation will focus on whether the tree had been properly secured and will also look at the impact of the weather,” he said.\n\nStorm Pia, which disrupted traffic in the UK and the Netherlands on Thursday, also hit western Belgium, where the weather service issued a yellow code warning for the coastal areas.\n\nThe storm caused one death in the Netherlands, where a woman died of her injuries on Friday after she was hit by a falling tree the previous day, her employer, the healthcare organisation ZoZijn, said.\n\nWell, 2023 didn’t exactly go to plan, did it?\n\nHere in the UK, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, had promised us a government of stability and competence – not forgetting professionalism, integrity and accountability – after the rollercoaster ride of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Remember Liz? These days she seems like a long forgotten comedy act. Instead, Sunak took us even further through the looking-glass into the Conservative psychodrama. \n\nElsewhere, the picture has been no better. In the US, Donald Trump is now many people’s favourite to become president again. In Ukraine, the war has dragged on with no end in sight. The danger of the rest of the world getting battle fatigue and losing interest all too apparent. Then there is the war in the Middle East and not forgetting the climate crisis …\n\nBut a new year brings new hope. There are elections in many countries, including the UK and the US. We have to believe in change. That something better is possible. The Guardian will continue to cover events from all over the world and our reporting now feels especially important. But running a news gathering organisation doesn’t come cheap. \n\nSo this year, I am asking you – if you can afford it – to give money. Well, not to me personally – though you can if you like – but to the Guardian. The average monthly support in Romania is around €3, however much you give, all that matters is you’re choosing to support open, independent journalism.\n\nWith your help, we can make our journalism free to everyone. You won’t ever find any of our news reports or comment pieces tucked away behind a paywall. We couldn’t do this without you. Unlike our politicians, when we say we are in this together we mean it.\n\nHappy new year!",

        "title": "Your 'Brain Care Score' Might Be Able to Predict Your Risk of Dementia, Stroke",
        "authors": "Sherri Gordon",
        "date": "2023-12-11",
        "articleBody": "A new test may indicate how likely you are to develop dementia or have a stroke, according to a new study.\n\nThe Brain Care Score (BCS)—a new tool to measure brain health—refers to how a person fares on 12 health-related factors concerning physical, lifestyle, and social-emotional parameters.\n\nA study published early this month in Frontiers in Neurology found that people with a higher BCS have a lower risk of developing dementia or having a stroke later in life.1\n\nThe BCS was developed in partnership with patients, families, and practitioners, Jonathan Rosand, MD, MSc, a study author and principal investigator for the Center for Genomic Medicine at Mass General Research Institute, told Health.\n\n“We started with the question we received most often from patients and their families, ‘What can I do to take good care of my brain so that I don’t come down with a stroke or memory loss like my mother or father?’” said Rosand, who is also a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe explained that the BCS takes science and converts it to information that can be used to assess someone’s risk of stroke or dementia in the future.\n\nEach five-point improvement in the BCS was associated with a 59% lower risk of developing dementia and a 48% lower risk of experiencing a stroke among adults younger than 50 years old when they enrolled in the study.1\n\n“The components of the BCS include recommendations found in the American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential Eight for cardiovascular health, as well many modifiable risk factors for common cancers,” Rosand said. “What’s good for the brain is good for the heart and the rest of the body.” \n\n Understanding Risk Allows You to Take Action Sooner\n\nBecause dementia and stroke affect people of all backgrounds and all genders around the world, Rosand says everyone can benefit from using the BCS.\n\nPlus, improving on the element mentioned in the test will also provide overall health benefits.\n\nThe physical aspects of the BCS include blood pressure, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, and body mass index. Lifestyle factors include nutrition, alcohol consumption, aerobic activities, sleep, and smoking cessation. The social-emotional aspects involve having relationships, managing stress, and finding meaning in life.1\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these factors early on could make a huge difference in future well-being.\n\n“Alzheimer’s disease is thought to be 15 to 20 years in the making before symptoms show, so we should be addressing lifestyle change in our 40s and 50s,” Amanda Price, a health coach and personal trainer, told Health.\n\n“Stroke tends to strike at a younger age in men than in women, and women become more vulnerable post-menopause,” said Price, who owns The Age Well Coach and helps people in midlife reduce their dementia risk. “Vascular dementia seems to come on more quickly than Alzheimer’s, so our lifestyle in midlife is key.”\n\n Improving Your BCS Score Is Possible\n\nJust because you take the BCS doesn’t mean your score is locked in forever. Each health factor the test assesses can be changed.\n\n“For example, if you lower your blood pressure, you can add three points. If you quit smoking, you can also add three points,” said Rosand. “The closer you get to the highest possible score of 21, the better care you’re taking of your brain.”\n\nTo increase your BCS and lower the chance of dementia and stroke, try doing things like eating healthy, exercising, and maintaining meaningful relationships and hobbies, Logan DuBose, MD, a geriatrics specialist and co-founder of Olera, a National Institute on Aging-funded group for dementia care, told Health.\n\n\"The study doesn't give specific tips, but it suggests that lifestyle habits like these help decrease the odds of dementia or stroke,\" he said.\n\nBesides nutritious eating, regular exercise, and meaningful socializing, DuBose explained that there are other ways to lower your risk of dementia and stroke, too.\n\n“Individuals benefit further from sleeping seven to eight hours each night, not smoking or drinking too much, and regularly following up with primary medical care,” he said. “Taking care of yourself in these ways can help keep your brain and body healthy.”\n\nPrice added that another important factor in preventing dementia is insulin resistance—which is not one of the key components of the BCS. Having hormones out of balance can be a risk factor for cognitive decline, she said.\n\nLikewise, she encourages people to engage in strength training, be aware of their exposure to toxins, and make sure they are getting adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (oily fish), B vitamins, and vitamin D.\n\nPrice also encourages people in midlife to make sure they are stimulating their brains, too.\n\n“The worst thing our brains can do is retire,” she said. \n\n People in Midlife May Benefit the Most From the BCS\n\nAccording to Rosand, the BCS is a tangible way for people to take charge of their brain health.\n\nWhile this is true for everyone, people who are in midlife may experience the biggest benefit of the BCS.\n\n“For prevention of stroke or dementia, it appears screening with BCS may be beneficial for people 40 to 50 years old,” said DuBose.\n\nResearchers found that those in their 50s who used the BCS during the study to raise their score had a 32% lower risk of dementia and a 52% lower chance of stroke. Meanwhile, participants older than 59 had an 8% lower risk of dementia and a 33% lower risk of stroke.1\n\nFor this reason, midlife is the key window of opportunity to make sure you are doing what you can to mitigate your risk—especially if you had a family member who suffered from Alzheimer’s or dementia.\n\n“It is never too soon or too late to gain an understanding of your current health and dementia risk, though,” said Price. “However, the most benefit would be had for those 40 [and older].”",

        "date": "2023-12-01",
        "articleBody": "Swapping animal protein for plant-based protein could have heart health benefits, a new study finds.\n\nCardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes affect a large portion of the population.2 Both these conditions can be impacted by someone’s diet.\n\nFollowing a plant-based diet has been linked to many positive health outcomes, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature death.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, animal-based foods, especially processed meats, have been linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature death.\n\nEarlier this month, a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the connection between well-being and swapping animal protein for plant-based options.\n\nSpecifically, the research team evaluated data from 37 studies, looking at how this dietary swap impacted cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and risk of early death.\n\n“Rather than just survey groups of people who regularly eat foods like nuts, legumes, and whole grains versus processed meats, the analysis looked at studies that viewed changes in blood work before and after they substituted animal foods with whole plant foods,” Kelly Jones MS, RD, CSSD, LDN, sports and fitness dietitian told Health.\n\nShe explained that this way, the researchers looked at cause-and-effect relationships between swapping animal products for whole plant foods and reduction in cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risks.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the health benefits of swapping animal protein for plant-based options, as well as plant-based options to consider adding to your diet. \n\n Swapping Animal-Based Protein For Plant-Based Options\n\nAfter analyzing the available data, the research team found a decrease in the risk of cardiovascular disease when substituting processed meat with nuts, legumes, and whole grains. They also found a similar benefit when nuts replaced eggs and olive oil replaced butter. \n\nWhen it came to type 2 diabetes incidence, the researchers found a moderate reduction in risk when the following substitutions were made:1\n\n    Red meat with whole grains/cereals \n    Red meat or processed meat with nuts \n    Poultry with whole grains\n    Eggs with nuts or whole grains\n\nFinally, the following replacements appeared to reduce the risk of early death due to any cause:1\n\n    Red meat for nuts and whole grains\n    Processed meat with nuts and legumes\n    Dairy with nuts\n    Eggs with nuts and legumes\n\nThis evidence highlights the potential benefits of shifting from an animal-based diet to a plant-based diet, Sabrina Schlesinger, MSc, one of the study authors and a researcher at the German Center for Diabetes Research in Düsseldorf, told Health.\n\nThis isn’t the first study suggesting that this food swap can be beneficial.\n\nData published earlier this year in Nutrients showed that partial replacement of meat with walnuts demonstrated significant increases in the average intake of fiber, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nParticipants who made this partial swap also experienced lower cholesterol and an improved overall diet quality.\n\n It is important to note that, while this data suggests making plant-based swaps, it is possible to include animal-based proteins in a diet that promotes balance and well-being.\n\nCertain animal-based protein choices offer unique features that support other aspects of our health. For example, eggs are one of the best sources of choline, a nutrient that is important for memory.5 And, lean beef is an important source of heme iron.6\n\nThat said, eating more servings of meat, poultry, and eggs than the Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests could prompt some undesirable health consequences.7 Making simple dietary swaps, like plant-based options instead of animal protein, is a step in the right direction.\n\n“Eating more plant-based proteins helps promote heart health, bowel regularity, and blood sugar control,\" Bethany Keith, MS, RDN, LD, CNSC, a registered dietitian at Renal Care 360°, told Health. “[Plant-based proteins] also promote reduced levels of inflammation, which can help prevent and manage chronic kidney disease.”\n\nIncorporating more plants, in general, also tends to naturally lower someone’s intake of animal food products, explained Megan Byrd, RD, a registered dietitian.\n\nAccording to Jones, most Americans eat too much lower-quality, ultra-processed food, sometimes assuming the product is healthier just because it’s vegan or plant-based.\n\n“Many packaged processed foods can offer high nutritive value, while others may be best suited for an ‘every once in a while’ experience,” she said. “Things to consider when comparing animal-based and plant-based foods include the amount of total and saturated fats, total protein content and protein quality, added sugar, and vitamin and mineral content.”",

        "articleBody": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have advised people to not panic but rather remain alert and vigilant.\n\nAfter a surge in the cases of the new COVID subvariant JN.1, doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have advised people to not panic but rather remain alert and vigilant.\n\n\"People are getting infected by the new sub-variant of COVID-JN.1 in many states of the country. The symptoms of the patients are mild. Therefore, there is no need to panic but the need to remain alert,\" doctor Neeraj Nischal said.\n\nDoctor Nischal, who is an Additional Professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS Delhi, said, \"We have been saying this type of ripple will keep on happening. Even during the first and second waves, we predicted that this virus would mutate further and the stage would come where it would become more infectious but at the same time cause less mortality or morbidity.\"\n\n\"So this is, you can say, a fight between the viruses in human beings who are also trying to survive. People are becoming infected but at the same time, it's not causing the problem that its predecessors, like the delta variant, caused,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"The important thing is that we are more aware of this virus and that we know how to deal with it. So if you see cases increasing, that shows that our surveillance system is in place, and we can pick up any new surge or any new variant that is coming into our society. So this should not be a cause for panic. This only shows how well we are prepared now and I think we should be able to handle this in a good way,\" he added.\n\nDoctor Neeraj Nischal further said, \"From the data that is emerging, the new subvariant is not very different from omicron. We are looking into whether the virus is causing similar types of symptoms like coughing, cold, sneezing, fever, and body aches.\"\n\nThe doctor also stated that the team of health specialists is investigating whether the subvariant is causing serious lung damage, whether it's causing oxygen requirements, or whether it needs hospitalisation.\n\n\"There are certain pockets in the country where we are witnessing cases, but that cannot be generalised for the country. So it's good. We have a good surveillance system in place and we can contain this disease and that's the most important thing,\" added the doctor.\n\n\"I will not say that we are seeing an increased number of COVID cases in our OPD it's not like that. We do witness a lot of common cold and flu patients this season. So this is a generalised type of respiratory infection that happens during the winter so there is nothing new that we are witnessing at the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"I won't be saying that we are witnessing an increased number of cases or something serious about patients. No, it's the routine cases that we see every winter. That's what we are witnessing now,\" he added.\n\nDoctor Nischal said that hospitalisation is not increasing, patients are not requiring oxygen, and the mortality rate is not increasing, so there is no need to panic, but this is the time to be alert, and because this disease has been fought earlier also, we are ready because the cases may increase further in the future.",

        "articleBody": "The incident took place 200 nautical miles south-west of Gujarat’s Veraval coast and the ship was carrying a crew of 22 sailors including 21 Indian nationals.\n\nThe Indian Navy and coast guard on Saturday swung into action to render help to a merchant vessel, suspected to be the target of a drone attack in the Arabian Sea, and diverted a warship and a patrol vessel to a location 217 nautical miles off the Gujarat’s Porbandar coast where the Liberian-flagged ship was disabled after its power generation system was hit, Indian officials monitoring the situation said.\n\nThe navy and the coast guard also scrambled their maritime surveillance planes, a P-8I and a Dornier, to respond to the emergency within minutes of receiving information about the emergency flagged by the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), the position reporting and emergency incident response interface with merchant ships at sea, the officials said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a security notification issued on Saturday, UKMTO said it received a report of “an attack by Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) on a vessel causing an explosion and fire.” It said the incident took place 200 nautical miles south-west of Gujarat’s Veraval coast. “Fire extinguished, no casualties. Authorities are investigating. Vessels are advised to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity to UKMTO,” the notification said.\n\nIt was not immediately known who was behind the incident.\n\nThe ship in distress, MV Chem Pluto, is carrying a crew of 22 sailors including 21 Indian nationals, HT has learnt. All of them are safe. The master in command of the vessel is an Indian: Deepesh Badikkihil. The only non-Indian crew is from Vietnam.\n\nThe chemical tanker carrying ethylene dichloride was on its way from Saudi Arabia’s Jubail port to New Mangalore in Karnataka, said one of the officials cited above.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when the region is facing an array of security challenges including Houthi militia targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea after the Israel-Hamas conflict began on October 7, and the apparent resurgence of piracy. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels declared their support for Hamas.\n\nAfter receiving information about Chem Pluto, the Mumbai-based Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) activated the International SafetyNET to rush the nearest merchant vessel in the area to inspect the chemical tanker, said a second official. The SafetyNET is the service for broadcasting and automatic reception of maritime safety information via satellite communications.\n\n“MV Merlin, which was in the area, went to check on MV Chem Pluto. Merlin reported that the Chem Pluto crew was safe, but the ship’s power generation had failed. The navy and coast guard diverted their ships to the area as it is on the fringes on India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ),” said a third official. Every coastal country’s EEZ extends to 200 nautical miles from its shores, and it has exclusive rights to all resources in the water, including oil, natural gas and fish.\n\nThe warship and the coast guard’s offshore patrol vessel Vikram are expected to reach Chem Pluto’s location on Saturday night, the officials said.\n\nINS Kochi had earlier intercepted Maltese-flagged merchant vessel Ruen that was seized by unknown attackers in the Arabian Sea on December 14. It tailed the hijacked vessel until it entered the territorial waters of Somalia. One of the 18 sailors on board MV Ruen was on December 18 transferred to the Indian stealth destroyer for medical assistance after he was injured. He was transferred ashore at Oman the following day.\n\n“In the light of Ruen incident and towards augmenting the anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden area, the Indian Navy has deployed another indigenous guided missile destroyer in the region. The Indian Navy remains committed to ensuring safety of merchant shipping and rendering assistance to the mariners at sea, as a ‘first responder’ in the region,” the navy said in a statement on December 21.\n\nThe European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Operation Atalanta - the EU maritime security operation in the western Indian Ocean - also swung into action to track Ruen and join the anti-piracy effort.\n\nThe Ruen incident put piracy in the Arabian Sea back in the spotlight. Pirate attacks in the region peaked between 2008 and 2013 but had steadily declined thereafter because of the concerted efforts of the multinational maritime task force operating in the region.\n\nThe region accounted for almost 700 pirate attacks during 2008-13, but the figure nosedived to a mere 16 during 2014-19, according to EUNAVFOR data. The December 14 incident was the first in the last three years. The EUNAVFOR figures cover all attacks mounted by suspected pirates including the ones repelled, aborted and those leading to ships landing in pirate hands and crews being taken hostage.\n\nThe Indian Navy has been deployed in the Gulf of Aden for more than 15 years.\n\nAt any given time, one Indian warship has been carrying out round-the-clock anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden since October 23, 2008, to protect Indian seaborne trade, instil confidence in the seafaring community and act as a deterrent for pirates.\n\nSo far 107 Indian warships have been deployed in the Gulf of Aden to ensure safe passage of India-flagged merchant vessels and they have thwarted scores of piracy attempts and safely escorted thousands of ships with tens of thousands of Indian sailors.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on December 19 discussed the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict with the Indian leader emphasising the need for an early resolution of hostilities.\n\nThe safety of maritime traffic also figured in the conversation against the backdrop of attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea by the Houthi rebels.

        "articleBody": "In 1940s, Dr. Mamie Clark and Dr. Kenneth Clark were the first African-American woman and man to earn psychology Ph.Ds from Colombia University. Their groundbreaking work examined the effects of segregation, poverty, and Jim Crow laws on children.\n\nTheir experiments were quite simple. They used dolls — all the same except for their skin and hair color — and asked the children participating (all Black, all between the ages of three and seven) which doll they liked best. Most of them chose the White doll.\n\nAs one can imagine, the implications of this go beyond culture, justice, and many more societal problems. It’s kind of the basis of American Fiction, the new film based on the novel, Erasure, by Percival Everett.\n\nIf you’ve seen the trailer, you can tell the themes swirling about this film are of contradictions, identity and problematic portrayals. It’s angry and painful, and complicated yet graspable. It’s the debut film for director Cord Jefferson, a former TV writer who has made his name with titles like Master of None, The Good Place, Station Eleven and the HBO series Watchmen for which he won an Emmy. (His backstory is pretty magnetic and if you want a magical read about fancy Vegas food, check out this feature he did for Eater back in October.)\n\nAll of this is to say that for all of the fresh energy Jefferson brings to the table, the actors in his American Fiction adaptation (yes, he wrote the film too) are seasoned veterans. The ensemble cast — Jeffery Wright, Tracee Ellis Ross, Erika Alexander, Leslie Uggams, Sterling K. Brown, Myra Lucretia Taylor, John Ortiz, Issa Rae and Adam Brody — gives breadth to the dualism presented throughout the story.\n\nProtagonist Monk (played by Wright) is an author and college professor but adopts a nom de plume, Stagg R. Leigh who writes a fantastical parody called “My Pafology.” Issa Rae portrays another Black author who garners acclaim writing about the experiences of inner-city women despite her middle-class background. Sterling K. Brown plays Monk’s younger gay brother.\n\nReviews have been favorable so far. American Fiction has also been nominated for two Golden Globes (Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actor for Jeffery Wright), and five Critics Choice Movie Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for Sterling K. Brown.",

        "articleBody": "In the realm of cinematic storytelling, “The Boys in the Boat” emerges as a poignant and riveting tale that navigates the waters of human resilience, teamwork, and the pursuit of an Olympic dream. Directed by esteemed actor and filmmaker George Clooney, this film captures the essence of triumph against all odds. It seamlessly weaves together history, emotion, and the sheer power of the human spirit, drawing inspiration from Daniel James Brown’s captivating 2013 book of the same name.\n\nCharting the course of an epic sports film: dive into the backstory\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, this film chronicles the remarkable true tale of a determined eight-oared rowing crew from the University of Washington. Their mission: to conquer the Men’s eight rowing competition. With exceptional precision and finesse, the narrative introduces a group of young men who, despite their varied backgrounds and personal obstacles, discover solace and purpose through the sport of rowing.\n\nAt the heart of this film lies a profound exploration of character development. Each member of the rowing team embodies their own triumphs and struggles in forming an unstoppable and tightly-knit crew. The on-screen camaraderie is both heartwarming and awe-inspiring, a testament to the unbreakable bonds forged through shared passion and purpose. The film also delves deep into the personal lives of the coaches, such as Al Ulbrickson (played by Joel Edgerton), boatbuilder George Pocock, and the student-athletes on the team, all hailing from working-class backgrounds. In particular, the story of rower Joe Rantz (portrayed by Callum Turner), who endured abandonment by his family and navigated life independently from a young age, adds a compelling narrative layer.\n\nSetting sail for a visually stunning journey\n\nThe Boys in the Boat presents itself as a cinematic spectacle. Sweeping shots capture the serene waters, contrasting with the intense physicality of rowing sequences. George Clooney and the filmmakers demonstrate meticulous attention to period details, immersing viewers in a time on the brink of war. In the simplicity of rowing, these young men discovered solace and purpose.\n\nBeyond being a sports drama, The Boys in the Boat stands as a testament to the enduring power of teamwork, determination, and the pursuit of excellence. It serves as a reminder that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, unlikely teams can etch their names into the annals of history, leaving an indelible mark on the human spirit.",

        "articleBody": "Taken as a whole, it’s almost an overwhelming amount of information that speaks to Netflix’s ability to engage its huge subscriber base (just under 239 million for the end of the period covered in the data dump) — and maybe not a ton more? The stats presented are for total hours viewed, which is how Netflix measures engagement across its portfolio — but it’s also not the metric the streamer uses to order its weekly top 10 lists. For those, it uses the “view” formula of total watch time divided by running time, which somewhat levels the playing field for films and series with shorter run times. (And there are, of course, economic factors and other metrics that influence decision-making that the company will continue to keep in house.) \n\n That explains why Wednesday is fourth on the 18,000-title list released Tuesday but first in Netflix’s all-time, English-language series rankings (which only cover the first 13 weeks of release). Season four of Stranger Things had more viewing time over that span, but since Wednesday‘s total run time was more than six hours shorter, it ranks first in views.\n\nAfter poring over the giant spreadsheet, here are some things that stand out.\n\nA very diverse top 25: Dr. Ana-Christina Ramón, director of UCLA’s Entertainment & Media Research Initiative — which puts out a Hollywood diversity report each year — noted that six of the top 25 titles on the list (Wednesday, La Reina del Sur season three, FUBAR, Manifest season four, The Mother and Fake Profile/Perfil Falso) have Latinx lead or co-lead actors. Nine other entries in the top 25 — Ginny & Georgia is there twice, for each of its two seasons — also feature people of color in lead or co-lead roles. That means 60 percent of the 25 biggest titles on the streamer from January to June star people from the global majority.\n\nAdditionally, six of the top 25 — La Reina Del Sur, Fake Profile and Korean series The Glory, Physical: 100, Crash Course in Romance and Doctor Cha — are in languages other than English (though dubbed versions also exist).\n\nTough break: The most watched show that ended up being canceled is Sex/Life, which had 175.5 million hours of viewing for season two, which premiered in early March, and 126.4 million for season one (available for all six months). Season two drew 45 percent less viewing time over its first four weeks than did season one (albeit with two fewer episodes), but both seasons ranked in the top 70 titles from January to June.\n\nJust behind Sex/Life is the fantasy drama Shadow and Bone, which Netflix cut in November. It had 292.4 million hours of viewing across its two seasons (including 192.9 million hours for season two. Netflix cut several other shows along with Shadow and Bone as it assessed its priorities following the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike in November.\n\nNo, thanks: About 21 percent of the 18,214 entries on Netflix’s spreadsheet — 3,813 in all — had between 50,000 and 149,999 hours of viewing (rounded to 100,000), a barely noticeable amount of time when the entire list totals to more than 93 billion hours. As best we can tell, the least watched of those that was a) a Netflix original, b) released worldwide and c) was available for all six months is Making the Witcher: Blood Origin. It’s a 14-minute behind-the-scenes doc released the same day (Dec. 25, 2022) as the limited series spinoff of The Witcher starring Michelle Yeoh. Blood Origin itself had 65.3 million hours of viewing from January to June.\n\nThe Office is still a thing! At least in other parts of the world. The long-running NBC sitcom hasn’t been on Netflix in the United States since 2020, but its nine seasons amassed a combined 341.1 million hours of viewing worldwide between January and June.\n\nHere are the top 20 titles from the list, followed by some selected shows further down in the rankings.\n\n At No. 50 is The Recruit (146.9 million hours of viewing), the spy drama starring Noah Centineo as a young CIA officer. It premiered Dec. 16, 2022. While almost 147 million hours of viewing is a big number, The Recruit comes in 30 percent below the 20th ranked title (Luther: The Fallen Sun) and a whopping 82 percent less than The Night Agent, which sits at a clear No. 1 with 812.1 million hours of viewing.\n\nComing in 100th is That '90s Show (95.1 million hours), the streamer's sequel to That '70s Show (which, incidentally, streams on Peacock) that featured most of the original cast for at least a few episodes.\n\nAt No. 200 is season four of Suits (64.2 million hours), which was the top streaming show in the United States for most of the summer and fall, according to Nielsen rankings. It premiered stateside on Netflix on June 17 but has been available in other territories for years — which helps account for a discrepancy between the streamer's weekly top 10 rankings and the six-month list. Season four didn't crack the global top 10 at any point — only the first season did following its U.S. debut — but the boost from premiering in the States, coupled with half a year of viewing elsewhere in the world, carried the show to a relatively high spot in the rankings.\n\nDropping down to line 1,000 on the spreadsheet, it's season three of the French animated show Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir at 21.4 million hours. Miraculous is tied with the movie Hard Target 2, which (who knew?) is a sequel to/reboot of to the 1993 Jean-Claude Van Damme film (though Van Damme was not involved). Titles are listed alphabetically, so Miraculous gets the round number.\n\nOur final stop is at entry No. 7,830, where the 2014 British movie '71 is the first of 302 titles with 1 million hours of viewing. Netflix rounded each one's watch time to the nearest 100,000, so all 302 of those shows and movies had somewhere between 950,000 and 1,049,999 hours of viewing. That in turn means that starting with entry 8,132 (Sr., a documentary about filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.) every other title in the list had under 950,000 hours of viewing. Those 10,082 titles make up a majority of the entries on the list, but they collectively gathered only 3 percent of the 93.46 billion hours of viewing.",

        "articleBody": "A slew of beauty and fashion events have been canceled for the upcoming weeks, following the start of the Israel-Hamas War.\n\n Fall is traditionally the fashion world’s busiest season, but the devastating Israel–Hamas War has changed all that, with a slew of beauty and fashion events being canceled for the upcoming weeks. However, some insiders feel that the industry’s muted response has been a result of companies valuing profits in the increasingly important Middle Eastern market over taking a strong moral stance.\n\nAccording to Women’s Wear Daily, as of Oct. 12, beauty’s biggest players, including L’Oréal, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Estée Lauder Cos., Kering and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton have failed to make any statements on the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel or the humanitarian crises unfolding on the Gaza Strip. \n\n “I have always been proud that the beauty industry has been at the forefront of social justice and activism,” said Blushington CEO Natasha Cornstein, whose company released a statement in support of Israel. “As a human being, I’m disappointed by the overwhelming silence about the terrorist attacks, and I hope the beauty industry will speak up.”\n\nGlobal fashion and beauty brands are also grappling with a diverse, multinational workforce with differing beliefs, along with fear of political reprisals. “Some people might be concerned about speaking up after everything that happened with Anheuser-Busch, Target and Disney. They don’t want to put themselves into that position,” Wendy Liebmann, founder of WSL Strategic Retail told WWD. “Or they could be so stunned by it they don’t know what to say. But for an industry that has been much more engaged in social, economic and political issues, the quiet is a little surprising.”\n\nThey may fear backlash, like that aimed at Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the French fashion industry’s governing body, which was criticized by insiders after releasing a statement condemning the Hamas attacks, while ignoring the death of Palestinians at the hands of Israel.\n\nHowever, some fashion players have spoken out. American Eagle posted an image of the Israeli Flag on their flagship billboard in Times Square. Stella McCartney, Victoria Beckham and Gwyneth Paltrow’s GOOP have all released statements expressing sympathy for the suffering of the Israeli and Palestinian people. The Council of Fashion Designers of America issued a statement reading: “The CFDA condemns Saturday’s attack on Israel and stands with those determined to fight terrorism. We mourn the loss of life and pray for the cycle of violence to end for a lasting peace.”\n\nCompanies have rushed to protect their employees within the conflict zone. Fashion company Inditex, which owns Zara, shuttered stores in Israel, as did H&M and Spanish retailer Mango. According to WWD, Chanel’s global executive chairman Alain Wertheimer sent an email expressing horror over the terrorist attacks and the unfolding humanitarian crises. He also stated that the company’s priority was to ensure the safety of all Chanel employees in Israel and that the company would donate $4 million to humanitarian aid.\n\n An increasing number of events around the world have also been canceled or postponed in the wake of the conflict. Vogue Arabia, Chopard and Italian jeweler Pomellato have canceled upcoming events in the Middle East. We Design Beirut, a 4-day design festival scheduled for the end of October in Lebanon, was postponed for the safety of all participants. \n\nThe 2023 Fashion Trust of Arabia Awards, originally scheduled to be held on Oct. 25 in Dubai, has also been postponed. “At FTA, our purpose has always been to support the talent of designers in the MENA region,” Fashion Trust Arabia said in a released statement. “However, we believe that, given the current situation in the region, it would be inconsiderate to proceed with our event.”\n\nEvents in New York have been postponed as well. SoHo Commando canceled their Soho Green opening slated for Oct. 19 “in light of the heartbreaking world events that continue to unfold.”\n\nIsraeli designers Pnina Tornai and Galia Lahav both canceled showings of their new collections at NYC Bridal Fashion Week in solidarity with their country. “Our hearts are heavy, and our thoughts are with all those affected by this devastating conflict,” Lahav stated. “We hope for a future where we can come together to celebrate the beauty and creativity that define our brand.”",

        "authors": "Rosie Knight",
        "date": "2023-12-27",
        "articleBody": "Heart, humanity, and horror in equal measure.\n\nTo many, Godzilla films have become the stuff of hilarious memes and terrifyingly popular creepypastas, which can make it easy to forget that the original 1954 Japanese cinematic masterpiece was actually a somber reckoning with the cost of nuclear war and the horrors of the atomic bomb. While the fantastic creature work by Teizo Toshimitsu and Akira Watanabe — along with the actors inside the suits, Haruo Nakajima and Katsumi Tezuka — crafted one of the most legendary on-screen monsters of all time and launched a decades-long franchise. It was the human story at its heart, with a thoughtful thematic resonance that made it transcend the other monster movies of the era. In 2023, both of the new Godzilla projects, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters and Godzilla Minus One, have returned to that human heart, giving us two of the best entries to the franchise in years. \n\nBoth Monarch and Godzilla Minus One return to the origins of Godzilla, both figuratively and literally. Each project takes us back to the earliest days of the monster and its creation while adding context and color to both the past and the present of the legendary creature. It's interesting that both an American prestige TV show from the Legendary MonsterVerse and a Toho feature film both veered so closely back to the oft-forgotten soul of Godzilla in the same year. One of the biggest critiques of the American Godzilla films is that they are simple monster mashups and the human characters do nothing but distract from the action. In contrast, the contemporary Japanese Godzilla features have focused more on humans in the wake of Godzilla's destruction, but even the critically lauded Shin Godzilla didn't come close to the global success of Minus One, which has captured North American audiences' attention and dollars to record-breaking effect, cementing a renaissance for the King of the Monsters.\n\nThroughout Godzilla's cinematic history in the original Toho franchise, human stories have been key. Monarch represents the first time that an American adaptation has managed to capture the vitality of those relationships. In Japan it's a tradition as old as the monster itself, who in the 1954 classic wrought havoc on star-crossed lovers Hideto Ogata (Akira Takarada) and Emiko Yamane (Momoko Kochi), setting the stage for the importance of the human drama under the shadow of the monster. In the Heisei era entry Godzilla vs. Biollante, a scientist's grief and love for his daughter are key to the creation of the famous monster's new foe. Even in more maligned entries — and I write this as someone with a Minilla tattoo — like Son of Godzilla, the relationship between kaiju and human becomes even more important with Minilla telepathically communicating with a young child who has been kidnapped and dreams of the creature. All of that is to say that the importance of humanity in the face of Godzilla is a key tenant of the lore that both Minus One and Monarch excel at bringing to the screen in entirely different ways.\n\nIn Episode 6 of Monarch, there's a moment so human, so beautiful, and so brief that the audience might almost think they've imagined it. As Keiko and Bill reel from Lee's shocking arrival in Japan, Godzilla reveals itself from the depths of the water, proving that it wasn't killed by the US government's earlier attack. While Lee is horrified at the realization, Keiko looks up as Godzilla swims away and, for a moment, a smile of pure joy and relief flickers across her face. Though Keiko has made her position clear on the fact she thinks Monarch is being too aggressive, we learn so much about her character in this brief, quiet moment. It's a fantastic example of what the new Monarch series excels at: this is a human eye view of monsters. This isn't Godzilla looking down on us, it's us looking up at him. In Keiko, we get a new view of how humans feel about monsters. This isn't the screaming fear of the masses, it's the curiosity and respect for nature that comes from an inquisitive, scientific mind and empathetic heart. \n\nGodzilla Minus One takes a similar approach. But rather than the lens of wonder, it explores the human cost of war through the eyes of those who've survived both conflict and monsters. Continuing the storied tradition of science fiction and genre storytelling, Minus One uses the horror of Godzilla's attacks to explore trauma and PTSD, as well as exploring the impact of war and the nature of sacrifice. Koichi Shikishima (Kamiki Ryunosuke) has never forgiven himself for falsifying a fault on his plane to avoid his fate as a kamikaze pilot. But it was that very choice which put him in both the path of Godzilla and, later, an unexpected partner in survival and healing in Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe). While there are stunning moments of action and a terrifying Godzilla, much of our time is spent with Shikishima as he tries to find his way in the world. To him, Godzilla represents a failure of courage, a figure of revenge, and a potential redemption.\n\nMonarch is so aware of its focus on humanity that even its subtitle \"Legacy of Monsters\" holds a double meaning as the more we learn about Monarch and its origins the more they seem like the highly-militarized organization might be the true monsters of the Legendary franchise and the series. That also represents one of the smartest ways that the series challenges the films that came before. Godzilla (2014) recontextualized the monster in a post-9/11 framework that, like pretty much every franchise film in the 2010s, featured a heavily militarized squad of \"heroes\" who shot their way to victory. In that case it was Monarch, and many viewers wondered why the films centered around a group whose sole aim seemed to be killing the titular monster. Monarch builds a rich and at times heartbreaking history for the organization, from its beginnings as an idealistic science project started by friends Lee, Keiko, and Bill to its role as a secret black ops group that has predominantly dedicated itself to the destruction of Titans. It's a fantastic approach to expanding the world and lore in a meaningful way that's in conversation with its audience while also looking at the franchise as it exists nearly 10 years after Godzilla (2014) debuted. \n\nGodzilla Minus One Gallery\n\nThe focus on the human characters in these projects is so pronounced that if you actually count up the amount of time we spend with the monsters, the lack of it will surprise you. Yet Godzilla Minus One is the most successful live-action Japanese film in North American history, and Monarch has been a critical smash with viewers all over the globe falling for Godzilla once again. That is, of course, down to the skill of the craftspeople who created these stories: Minus One director Takashi Yamazaki and Monarch's creative minds of Chris Black, Matt Fraction, and Matt Shakman. Their restraint in choosing to only use Godzilla for impact — the exclamation mark to the human drama at the center of these stories — is admirable and effective. Neither Minus One or Monarch lacks monster action. It's just that the humans are equally if not more important driving the story just as much as the monsters that threaten their existence. Our viewing experience and the future of Godzilla is all the better for it.",

These are central to Linux’s success and, indeed, all successful software projects.\nWorking with the Linux community\n\n“People seem to think that open source is all about programming,” Torvalds stresses, “but a lot of it is about communication.” For a demographic sometimes characterized as geeky hermits more comfortable with ones and zeroes than social engagement, this is an interesting insight. “People are hard,” he says, but “code is easy.”\n\nNo software—and certainly no open source software—is ever just a lone programmer in front of a computer. In the case of Linux, “We rely on literally thousands of people every single release,” says Torvalds. Complicating things, “We have a thousand people involved and they’re not the same thousand people.” Maybe half of those people will “send just one patch, and a lot of them never show up again.” Managing those thousands who return, as well as welcoming the thousands who “have something small they wanted to fix that they cared about,” takes a great deal of social skill.\n\nTo do this well requires more than just software development talent, Torvalds goes on. “Maintainers are the ones who translate,” by which he means “the context, the reason for the code.” It’s hard because “people relationships are hard.” Maintaining parts of the Linux kernel, or any significant software, requires “a certain amount of good taste to judge other people’s code,” which can be partially “innate,” he says, “but a lot of it just takes practice…[over] many years.”\n\nFor these reasons, “It’s hard to find maintainers [and] it’s much easier to find developers.” Writing software isn’t as hard as incorporating software into larger, functional systems. That takes people skills, not just coding. So how have Torvalds and the Linux kernel community managed to interweave younger developers and their ideas with more established people and practices?\nRust never sleeps\n\nDespite the seeming perpetual youth of Linux adoption, the Linux kernel community hit AARP status a while back. During the next few years, some within the Linux kernel community will be 60 years old. A few will be 70. That’s a demographic you’d expect to be maintaining Cobol, not an operating system that continues to be the heart of modern application development. With that age also comes experience and adeptness at separating hype from substance and consistently delivering exceptional code.\n\nIt’s not just the gray-haired set that ensures Linux marches on. As Torvalds tells it, “One of the things I liked about the Rust side of the kernel was that there was one maintainer who was clearly much younger than most of the maintainers.” Certain areas of the kernel, like Rust, help attract new, younger talent. “We can clearly see that certain areas in the kernel bring in more young people,” he continues. Drivers are another prominent example.\n\nTorvalds isn’t swayed by some of the hype around Rust (“Rust has not really shown itself as the next great big thing”), but he’s still a fan, and not just for its technical merits. “Rust was one of those things that made technical sense, but to me personally, even more important was that we need to not stagnate as a kernel and as developers.” Rust has challenged Torvalds and the Linux kernel community to consider new approaches to old problems (and new approaches to new problems). It’s a way of feeding Linux’s fountain of youth and relevance.\n\nThis approach has worked for Torvalds for more than 30 years with the Linux kernel. Here’s to another 30 years of figuring out the social interactions that fuel great software systems, and how to encourage younger developers to bring their insights to evolving systems.",

        "title": "A first look at Windows AI Studio",
        "authors": "Simon Bisson",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "Available in an early preview, Microsoft’s AI development environment for the desktop lets you build small language models that run on PCs and mobile devices.\n\nMicrosoft used the developer-focused parts of its Ignite 2023 event to introduce a series of AI development tools. Azure AI Studio supports large-scale AI development for cloud-hosted applications, using Azure OpenAI models or others, while Copilot Studio extends the older Power Virtual Agents low-code AI tools with OpenAI-powered “boosts.”\n\nMicrosoft also announced a third tool, but it has taken a while for it to arrive on developer’s PCs. That tool is Windows AI Studio, now available in a preview. Let’s take a look.\nIntroducing Windows AI Studio\n\nWindows AI Studio is intended to bring Microsoft and its partners’ library of AI models to PCs, using GPUs now but eventually also on-board AI accelerators, like the Arm and Intel NPUs in Microsoft’s latest Surface hardware. These NPUs were first delivered in the Surface Laptop Studio 2 that I’m writing this column on. With DirectML support for the integrated Intel NPUs in these and other devices due early in 2024, this option should prove to be attractive for developers and for other users.\n\nWindows AI Studio is designed to help you train and customize models, getting them ready for use in your code. Once trained, you can convert models to run using the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) cross-platform runtime for use in desktop and mobile applications. Delivered as a Visual Studio Code extension, Windows AI Studio will allow you to bring many different tools and AI models into one place, working alongside the rest of your tools, so you can refine models at the same time as build them into .NET applications.\n\nWindows AI Studio offers an interesting hybrid of Windows and Linux tools, working across both your CPU and GPU, using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to host and run models. It’s an approach that does demand capable hardware, with plenty of memory and a recent GPU. You won’t be able to use Windows AI Studio without a discrete GPU, which can be either a workstation-grade card or an external GPU working over a Thunderbolt connection.\nWindows AI Studio installation and prerequisites\n\nWindows AI Studio is simple enough to install. You download it from the Visual Studio Marketplace, where you will also find quick start instructions. Note that by default the Visual Studio Marketplace view in Visual Studio Code is set to install release versions, so you may need to switch the view to pre-release versions. Once you’ve made that change the download is quick and easy.\n\nThere are some important prerequisites. You need an Nvidia GPU and WSL running at least the Ubuntu 18.4 release as its default Linux. Once installed Windows AI Studio then checks for Conda and CUDA support in your WSL environment, so it can use the GPU. If those aren’t installed, Windows AI Studio offers a one-click option for ensuring that all the prerequisite libraries are in place.\n\nThis uses Visual Studio Code’s remote server options to load and run an installation script. If you want to see it in operation, open Visual Studio Code’s built-in terminal and switch to its Output view. The installation can take a while, as it will download and install the relevant libraries. Expect it to take at least five minutes, and much more if you have an older PC. Windows AI Studio documentation is currently only on GitHub; Microsoft Learn only shows a placeholder page.\nYour first model in Windows AI Studio\n\nOnce installed, Windows AI Studio adds a new chip-like icon in the Visual Studio Code extensions sidebar. Tap this to launch the Windows AI Studio development environment. At launch it will check that your development environment still meets the necessary prerequisites. Once the checks have been passed, and any updates have been made to your WSL configuration, the extension loads a What’s New page and populates its actions pane with its current set of features. Four different actions are visible in the latest preview release, and more are planned. However, only one currently works, the model fine-tuning action.\n\nAdditional planned options include Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a playground for working with Microsoft’s Phi-2 foundation models, and access to a library of ready-to-use models from services like Hugging Face. Working with Phi-2 will allow you to build and train your own small language models, without needing to rely on cloud-hosted services like Azure OpenAI.\n\nRAG support will allow you to take an existing large language model and use it as a foundation for your own custom LLM without completely retraining it on your own data. RAG uses prompt engineering techniques to provide a more comprehensive context for the LLM to elicit more accurate answers. Using RAG, you can push more domain-specific or more up-to-date data into the LLM as part of a prompt, working with external data sources including your own business-specific information.\n\nAdding tooling for RAG into Windows AI Studio should help you build and test vector indexes and embeddings for your data. Once you have this, you can start to develop search-driven pipelines that will ground your LLM applications, restricting their responses to your own domain using tools like TypeChat, Prompt Flow, and Semantic Kernel.\nQuantizing a model with QLoRA\n\nFor now, however, this early preview release is focused on fine-tuning existing AI models, ready for conversion to ONNX and embedding in WinML projects. It’s worth using this feature alone, as it’s a key requirement for any custom machine learning product, where you want your model running on local hardware, not in the cloud.\n\nTo set up a model tuning environment, you start by choosing a local folder, then you pick a model. The initial selection is small, with five open-source text generation models available from Microsoft, Hugging Face, Mistral AI, and Meta. Here Microsoft is using the QLoRA tuning methodology: Quantized Low Rank Adapters, an approach that was developed at the University of Washington and has shown impressive results. The initial paper describes a model family that offers 99.3% of the performance of ChatGPT with only 24 hours of tuning on a single GPU.\n\nIf we’re to bring generative AI to our computers and handheld devices, this is the type of approach we need. We don’t need the complexity (or size) of a large language model; instead we need the same performance on our own data, in a small language model. QLoRA and similar techniques are a way to build these custom AIs on top of open-source foundational models.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen your model, click Configure project to begin setting up the project in both Windows and WSL. You may need to input an access token for Hugging Face or sign up for access before you can use a model. Windows AI Studio presents you with a set of tuning parameters that you will use to refine your model’s performance. For an initial test, simply accept the defaults and wait for the model to generate. There’s also the option to use additional datasets to improve tuning.\nFine-tuning a model using Olive\n\nOnce the model has been generated, you’re prompted to relaunch the Visual Studio Code window in a Windows AI Studio workspace. This switches you from Windows to WSL, ready to use the tools installed during setup. As part of the initial setup of your workspace, Windows AI Studio will install a Prompt Flow extension.\n\nWith the model workspace open, you can then use the Visual Studio Code terminal to start the Conda environment used to tune your model. You can now run Olive, using QLoRA on the default content or on your own dataset. This can take some time, so be prepared to wait. Even on a relatively high-end graphics card, tuning will take several hours.\n\nWhen the tuning process is complete you can use a simple Gradio web interface to test your trained model, before packaging it and using it in your applications. This is a fun little tool, and worth running before and after tuning so you can see how the process affects interactions.\n\nIt’s important to remember that this is a very early release of what is a complex tool. Microsoft has done a lot to simplify working with AI models and tuning tools, but you do still need to know what you want out of the language model you’re building. There are a lot of variables that you can tweak as part of the turning process, and it pays to understand what each one controls, and how they affect the resulting model.\n\nFor now, Windows AI Studio may well be a tool for the AI experts. However, it shows a lot of promise. As it evolves, and adds more features, it could easily become an essential part of the Windows development workflow—especially if AI accelerators become a common component in the next generation of PCs.",

        "articleBody": "If you are among the millions of people in Southern California celebrating Christmas this year, let me say that I truly love your holiday. The colorful lights strung across your yards bring me joy each winter. I love your festive foods — tamales, roasts and all those cookies — and I’ve been singing along to Christmas music in the car for nearly a month now.\n\nBut as a Jewish person, I will always think of Christmas as your holiday, not mine. Nothing looks cozier than a Christmas tree glowing in a darkened living room, but I’m not going to put one up, hang lights around my house or put a wreath on my door. Instead, my family already observed our winter holiday — lighting the menorah and frying latkes in an ungodly amount of oil.\n\nStill, not celebrating Christmas is hard when it persistently permeates the culture — and that’s especially true for kids. When my son was in elementary school, he was very blue on Christmas. “It’s not fair,” I remember him saying. “Everyone else gets to celebrate except us.”\n\nBut, of course, it’s not “just us.” Here in Los Angeles, we are blessed to live in the most religiously diverse city in the world, where Jewish families like mine are joined by Muslims, Bahais, Hindus, Jehovah’s Witnesses and others who either don’t celebrate Christmas at all or who have devised their own ways of honoring what some have come to see as a secular or American holiday. (Many Buddhists celebrate Christmas without the Jesus part.)\n\nOver the years, my family has developed our own rituals on Dec. 25 — many of them established to chase my son’s melancholy away. In the morning, we watch a YouTube playlist of some of our favorite holiday sketches from “Saturday Night Live,” including Robert Smigel’s claymation classic “Christmastime for the Jews” and Adam Sandler’s first performance of “The Hanukkah Song.” (He looks so young.) We usually go on a hike (nature is always open), and if we can’t score an invite to someone’s Christmas dinner, we’ll make our own feast while listening to what my husband calls “acceptable Christmas music.’’ (“Up on the House Top” by the Jackson 5 tops his list.)\n\nOver the last month, I interviewed five families from different faith backgrounds about their experiences not celebrating traditional Christmas. Some felt proud of being outside the mainstream at this time of year; others admitted yearning, especially when they were younger, to celebrate a holiday that centered kids so fully. But most agree that Christmas — with its values of love, peace, family and the joy of giving and receiving gifts — is pretty beautiful. And some talked about holidays with similar themes in their own traditions.\n\nIt’s OK to be different\n\nSitting at their dining room table in El Sereno while their kids watch Elmo on TV, Melody and Nariman Tashakor agree that they didn’t mind not celebrating Christmas when they were growing up in Canada in the ’80s and ’90s.\n\n“We were always the darkest house on the street,” says Nariman, who, like Melody, is the child of immigrants who fled Iran after being persecuted for their Bahai faith. “And there were no other religions in my town. It was Christian or us.”\n\nMelanie’s hometown was more culturally diverse, but she remembers bringing home Christmas crafts from elementary school and singing in the Christmas concert (she still loves Christmas music). “It was very Christmas centered,” she says. “But I don’t remember feeling embarrassed. I enjoyed it all, honestly. I think it’s such a beautiful holiday.”\n\nLooking back at it now, they both remember thinking it was kind of cool that they didn’t celebrate the same holiday as everyone else. “I remember when I was in first or second grade, I was like, ‘I have information that you don’t have,’” Nariman says. “‘Santa’s not real.’”\n\n“I thought it was cool too,” Melody says. “It made us unique.”\n\nWhether their two kids, ages 4½ and 2, will feel the same way is unclear. Their daughter Naia started transitional kindergarten in the fall and has been asking a lot of questions about Christmas.\n\n“I don’t want them to think that we just do everything because other people do it.”\n\n“We talked about it, and I said that in our family, we have other traditions that are our cultural traditions,” Melody says. “I don’t want them to think that we just do everything because other people do it. I want them to know it’s OK to be different.”\n\nShe also talks up the Bahai holiday Ayyam-i-ha, which is celebrated in February and marks the end of the Bahá’í year. Like Christmas, it’s a time for friends and families to give gifts, spend time together and do service for others.\n\n“Christmas is such a strong force at this time of year,” Melody says. “I keep saying to her, ‘Just wait until Ayyam-i-ha.’”\n\nThey make their own holidays ‘really fun’\n\nThere’s a lot of Christmas decor surrounding the Tustin home of Sara and Sameer Ahmed and their three young children. Lights twinkle in the bushes in their neighbors’ yards and wreaths decorate their front doors. Blue and white light icicles drip from one garage, while a string of ornaments hangs from another. But the Ahmeds’ decorating will come later, when they put up strings of moon and star lights to celebrate Ramadan, a holy month in the Islamic calendar.\n\nImran, 7, has friends who celebrate Christmas, but he doesn’t think it’s a big deal that his family doesn’t. Instead, he looks forward to Eid al-Fitr, the first day after Ramadan, which he says is kind of like Christmas. \n\n“In the morning, you have to wake up pretty early to do Eid prayers, and then you meet family and get gifts from them and you give to charity and then you go home and get gifts from your family,” he says, surrounded by pillows on a fluffy couch.\n\nHis dad, Sameer, whose parents immigrated from India and who grew up in Bakersfield, remembers watching his friends celebrate Christmas and thinking that it all looked like a lot of fun — the reindeer, the presents, the songs that he’d somehow memorized without even trying. Now that he has kids, he wants to make Muslim holidays just as exciting for them.\n\n“It’s hard to replicate Christmas when it’s something the entire society does,” he says. “But we’ve kind of taken it on ourselves, as a lot of parents our generation in the Islamic faith here have, to try to make our holidays really fun.”\n\nWhile the Ahmeds don’t celebrate Christmas themselves, they do support the celebrations of their friends. They cheered their neighbors on when they won second place in their community’s Christmas decorating contest, and as physicians, they often pick up the Christmas shift at the hospital so their colleagues can be with their families.\n\n“We want them to enjoy it,” Sara says. “And for us, it’s just another day.”",

        "articleBody": "For the month of December, some residents of a South Torrance neighborhood can’t order a pizza or Thai food from DoorDash or UberEats and it’s not because of budget constraints.\n\nIt’s because of their neighborhood tradition of elaborate residential holiday light displays on more than 300 houses and lawns that thousands of families across the city travel to each year to enjoy.\n\nEvery year for the last 39 years, hundreds of houses in the Seaside Ranchos community of Torrance participate in the Seaside Holiday Lights event by putting up string lights, and inflatable and homemade decorations to celebrate the winter season.\n\nThe upscale neighborhood, home to multimillion-dollar single-family houses, looks like something out of a Christmas movie. Lines of visiting cars playing “Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays” and “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” can be heard from several blocks away. The crowds start to grow after sunset, when the lights can be seen from a few neighborhoods over. Traffic police set up cones and direct the minivans filled with families through the neighborhood. One resident described living in the neighborhood as being similar to “ Cinderella’s castle at Disney,” where everyone is outside looking in.\n\nIn front of their home with a U-shaped driveway, the Franco family strung lights all over their trees and decorated their lawn with several reindeer, a giant inflatable Frosty the Snowman and Santa Claus. Peeking out of a tree in their frontyard is a Grinch with presents and a wreath.\n\nThe Francos have lived on Doris Way, one of at least six streets that make up the hilly figure-eight neighborhood, for the last nine years. Decorating their house usually takes four people three days.\n\n“We think ours is the most beautiful house,” said Rosie Franco, noting how blessed her family is to have the resources to be able to put the decorations out each year.\n\nEach December, the Francos’ electric bill can be roughly $2,500, double their typical $1,200 monthly bill. Other homeowners in the neighborhood noted they spend hundreds of dollars on their electric bills in December, ranging from $500 to $1,200. Many residents said seeing the kids and families enjoy the decorations is priceless.\n\nSeveral homeowners switched to LED lights to lower their electricity usage. Some hire outside help to get the lights strung up on the tall trees in their yards and in the community. One homeowner turned to EBay to score a deal on a $700 15-foot snowman after the holiday season.\n\nThe neighborhood doesn’t require anyone to put lights or decorations up, but most houses in the community put up some string lights or some small decorations from after Thanksgiving until New Year’s Day. Some homeowners in the community put out little benches so families can pose for photos and many residents sit outside to watch the joy being spread.\n\nSeveral generations of families walking with their SoCal winter gear and hot chocolate stop to take photos in front of their favorite displays. For some, it has been a holiday tradition to walk the lights. Nicole and Ryan Villasin came with their 3-year-old daughter, Serena, on a rainy Monday in December along with hundreds of other L.A. residents to take in the Christmas spirit in the Torrance Seaside community. The two grew up in Carson and have come to Torrance each December since they were in high school.\n\nOther homeowners grew up with the tradition. Suzie Montoya grew up in the house that she now lives in with her husband, Andrew. She was a freshman in high school when they started the tradition in the neighborhood. Since then, the number of streets that decorate has grown from just one or two to six. She said she and her husband have to be organized when they leave the house and sort of plan around the lights since the traffic can wrap around for several streets. Some residents have a “secret” route to avoid the traffic, and others just use December evenings to stay home.\n\n“I would be sad if it went away,” Montoya said. “It’s fun to see all of the little kids enjoying the decorations and seeing people we know.”\nSeveral blocks of the Torrance neighborhood are covered in festive string lights. \n\nThe Montoyas and many of their neighbors use long sticks with a hook to quickly wrap string lights around their trees. Some residents, when moving away from the neighborhood, pass down their decorating stick to the new homeowners.\n\nThat was the case with the Leach family, who found a pool stick in their house when they moved in. Kristen and Daniel Leach put up homemade Christmas trees made from wood pallets in their frontyard and, for each year they have lived in the house, they hide a Mickey Mouse amid their lawn decorations. This year there are six Mickeys.\n\n“It’s a good tradition that brings the community together,” said Kristen Leach.",

        "date": "2023-02-02",
        "articleBody": "Apple is ready to launch an updated iPad Air with the first brand-new model in years. Here's everything we know about the upcoming launch. \n\nThe iPad Air was last updated in March 2022 and rumors suggest that the arrival of a new model (or two!) could be coming soon. Here’s all we know so far about the 6th generation iPad Air. The most recent Apple event took place on October 30, but there were no new iPads at that event, but we expect one in early 2024. Here’s everything you need to know about the new model.\n2024 iPad Air release date: When will the new model arrive?\n\n    Expected: Spring 2024\n\nApple’s event on October 30 saw the company only launch new Macs, and 2023 passed without a single iPad update for the first time since Apple’s late CEO and founder Steve Jobs introduced the category in 2010. The past three generations of iPad Air arrived about 18 months apart, and since the 5th generation arrived in March 2022, we are overdue for an update.\n\nBut we might not have much longer to wait. In early December 2023, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release new iPads and an M3 MacBook Air by the end of March 2024. He repeated that claim in January 2024, reporting that new iPads had gone into production ahead of a March launch.\n\nThe iPad Air is unlikely to be the only iPad getting an update in 2024. In November 2023, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote that Apple will refresh all four iPad lines—standard, mini, Air, and Pro—in 2024. Gurman believes that a new iPad Pro will also launch at the March event.\n\nRoss Young, an analyst who specializes in the displays industry, tweeted that shipments of the display panels for a new 12.9-inch Air began in December, which indicates a spring release.\n\n2024 iPad Air sizes: Is Apple preparing to release a larger model?\n\n    Rumored: The standard 10.9-inch model and a new 12.9-inch option.\n\nAn October 2023 9to5Mac report claimed, not only that “there are multiple new iPads on track for the coming months,” but that this includes two new iPad Air models. The site indicates that Apple “may be considering introducing a larger version of the iPad Air, or a more expensive model with better specs.” This theory seems to be based on the fact that there are two codenames associated with the new iPad Air: J507 and J508, with the only other iPad having two codenames being the iPad Pro, which also comes in two sizes.\n\nIn November Ming-Chi Kuo discussed the additional iPad Air size, saying that the iPad Air line will be split into two sizes: 10.9-inch and a new 12.9-inch model. And the tweet above from Young also confirms the existence of a new iPad Air display size.\n\n2024 iPad Air price: How much will the new model cost?\n\n    Expected: Starting at $599 for the 10.9-inch model; $699 for the 12.9-inch model.\n    International price drop? Outside the U.S. Apple shoppers are hoping Apple will reverse the price hikes of the past few years, as they did with the iPhone.\n\nRegarding the potential pricing of the iPad Air 6, we can look at the generations that have preceded it as a clue for what you’ll have to pay when it finally does arrive.\n\niPad Air (5th Generation)\n\n    64GB, Wi-Fi – $599 / £669\n    256GB, Wi-Fi – $749 / £849\n    64GB, Cellular – $749 / £849\n    256GB, Cellular – $899 / £1,029\n\niPad Air (4th Generation)\n\n    64GB, Wi-Fi – $599 / £579\n    256GB, Wi-Fi – $749 / £729\n    64GB, Cellular – $729 /£709\n    256GB, Cellular – $879 / £859\n\nAs you can see, Apple kept most of the pricing roughly the same for its U.S. customers when moving between the last few generations, while outside the U.S. buyers got hit with aggressive price hikes (a trend that happened across all Apple products). However, Apple reversed these price hikes in 2023 when it introduced the iPhone 15, so we are hopeful that outside the U.S. Apple shoppers may see iPad prices decrease.\n\nIf Apple does introduce a higher spec or larger iPad Air to accompany the current size, we could see lower prices for the entry-level model and higher prices at the top of the range. But with the iPad mini costing $499, it’s more likely that Apple adds $100 or $150 for the larger model. This would be similar pricing as the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus and create some distance between the Air and Pro lines.\n\n\n2024 iPad Air features: How will the new model be better?\n\nFor a device whose release could be imminent, there are a ton of rumors about the iPad Air 6. This might be a case of Apple tightening up any leaks that were appearing in its production chain, or that any updates to the iPad Air will be minimal. Here’s what we do know:\nA new M2 processor\n\nThe most obvious area where the iPad Air 6 will be superior to the iPad Air 5 is in the processor. The iPad Air 5 already boasts a pretty nifty M1 chip, but the iPad Pro has been sporting M2 silicon for over a year, and it’s likely to get an update to the new M3 chipset in 2024. So it’s likely that Apple will keep the iPad Air on the older M2 generation to make the iPad Pro more attractive to high-end users. Gurman and others have reported that Apple’s plan is indeed to put an M2 chip in the iPad Air.\n\nA bigger and better display\n\nWhile the iPad Pro is rumored to gain an OLED display for the first time, it’s likely that the iPad gets the same treatment. Rather, Apple is planning on introducing a larger iPad Air at the same 12.9 inches as the iPad Pro, but without slightly different tech, according to Ming-Chi Kuo: “The 12.9-inch iPad Air is an all-new model, and while it lacks mini-LED, it benefits from an Oxide backplane (the same spec as the existing mini-LED iPad Pros), offering better display performance than the 10.9-inch iPad Air with an a-Si backplane.”\n\nThe same design with new colors\n\nUnfortunately, the iPad Air is unlikely to get a new design to with the new model. Leaked renders of the new device show a design that’s nearly identical to the current model, including the placement of the front camera on the short edge. We had hoped Apple might change the placement to landscape after the 10th-gen iPad changed the position. It appears not to be, however.\n\nThe only design change to speak of is a slight tweak to the rear camera. While we don’t expect it to gain a second camera, Apple will apparently put the flash inside a new oval camera well. We also expect new colors, either brighter to match the 10th-gen iPad or more muted to match the iPhone 15.\nMore storage options\n\nSince the release of the iPhone 13, Apple has offered a baseline storage capacity of 128GB. Sadly, this hasn’t been the case with the iPad line, which currently starts at a rather paltry 64GB unless you opt for a Pro model. Could the iPad Air 6 finally see this change? We hope rather than know that when the iPad Air 6 turns up, it will be endowed with a roomy 128GB so it can become a laptop replacement without paying extra for the 256GB model. With a larger screen, there have also been reports of higher storage options like the iPad Pro.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the latest news and rumors surrounding the 2024 iPad Air, so be sure to check back regularly to see what we can find. In the meantime, here’s a selection of the best deals for the iPad Air 5.",

        "articleBody": "If you are concerned about your privacy and security online using a VPN could give you some reassurance. Apple provides various measures in macOS that make Macs more secure, but if you want to ensure that the connection between your Mac and the internet is protected, rather than the computer itself, you need a VPN.\n\nUsing a VPN essentially makes you invisible on the web–your data is encrypted, your IP address is hidden, and you can even make it look like you are surfing from another country. This latter reason is the key motive many people using a VPN have: they want to access services that are locked to a particular region, such as accessing U.S. Netflix from the U.K or HBO Max from the U.K., or BBC iPlayer from the U.S.\n\nWhile accessing locked content is a bit of a gray area, due to licensing agreements, we don’t blame anyone who is desperate to watch the latest season of their favorite program when it airs in the U.S. rather than waiting for it to come to their country. Paying to watch a streaming service that’s not available in your country has to be less morally wrong than actual piracy!\n\nIf you are looking for a VPN to protect your privacy and security online, and to grant you a way to access content as if you are in a different country, we are here to help. There are a lot of VPN providers vying for your business, which can make finding the best one to suit your needs difficult. To help you sort out the right provider for you, we’ve committed to extensive research and testing of VPN services that cater to Mac owners in our guide to the top VPN services for Mac.\n\nDo Macs need a VPN?\n\nBefore we list our recommendations, there is a big question. Do Mac users even need a VPN? Since Apple introduced iOS 15 and macOS Monterey in 2021 the company has offered a handy private relay service. iCloud Private Relay acts a bit like a VPN because it encrypts your web-browsing traffic and sends it through a relay to hide your location, IP, and any information about what you were browsing. iCloud Private Relay solves part of the problem that Mac users have used VPNs for in the past–it means that companies cannot build a clear picture of you on the web, thereby protecting your privacy.\n\niCloud Private Relay has some disadvantages: it only works when you are using Safari, you have to be a subscriber to iCloud, and you can’t use it to pretend to be surfing from another country in order to access content that is locked to a particular region. Read more here: iCloud+ \n\nPrivate Relay explained.\n\nIf you are a subscriber to iCloud, and only use Safari, then iCloud Private Relay will provide you with some anonymity when you are surfing the web. You may therefore be thinking that this means you don’t need a VPN to hide your location and identity. However, iCloud Private Relay does not allow you to choose an IP address or a region, and you won’t be able to make it look like you’re coming from another location. So you can’t watch geographically locked Netflix content, for example.\n\nIssues with VPNs on Mac\n\nOne feature of VPNs is the ability to use Split Tunnelling to choose which apps go via a VPN and which don’t. However recent versions of macOS and the M-series Macs generally do not support this feature. Only Hide.me (reviewed below) supports Split Tunnelling on new versions of macOS and the M-series Macs.\n \nBest VPN for Mac\n\nOur current favorite service is NordVPN. But below you will find the top VPN services for Mac.\n\n    Most features: NordVPN\n    Best all-rounder: Surfshark\n    Most servers: Private Internet Access\n    Best premium: ExpressVPN\n    Most countries: PureVPN\n\nMost of these will cost less than $5/£5 per month, with some less than $3/£3. However, once your first year is over the price often jumps, so it’s worth setting a reminder to shop around 11 months after you subscribe so you can search for a better deal, alternatively, you could cancel and sign up with another email address. There are also a number of free VPNs available, but beware that some severely restrict which servers (and therefore countries) you can connect to and the amount of data you can download through those servers. You may be able to save money if you take a look at our round-up of VPN deals.\n\nIt’s also important to read the terms and conditions before using a free VPN, as in rare cases they sell your data to third parties to offset the cost of you using it without paying. It’s a bigger problem on iPhones and Android where unscrupulous companies try to cash in on the VPN ‘gold rush’ and offer up poorly put together apps. Stick with our recommendations and you’ll be safe from these, though.\n\nVPN apps very easy to install and use but for a step-by-step guide, read how to set up a VPN on a Mac.\n\nAll of these VPNs will also work on your iPhone and iPad as well, but you might want to check out our separate guides to the best VPNs for iPhone and best VPNs for iPad.\n\nBest VPNs for Mac 2023: Reviewed & Ranked\n\n1. NordVPN \n\n\n\nNordVPN is one of the biggest and best-known VPN services. It’s one of the easiest VPNs to use and has an up-to-date independent audit. It also has specialty servers for specific purposes. There are cheaper options, with unlimited connections and more in-depth VPN features, but NordVPN is our top choice right now because it stands out in so many areas, from speed and privacy to unblocking and ease of use.\n\nThere are more than 5,300 servers (none of which are virtual) available across 60 countries, which sounds great. You probably only care about the servers where you want to unblock content, but the more servers the better as it means you have a better chance of finding one that’s not overloaded. You won’t have to figure out which one to choose thanks to the handy ‘Quick connect’ feature that picks the server best suited to your needs.\n\nConnections are fast and reliable, and NordVPN unblocks popular streaming services around the world including Netflix, HBO Max, and BBC iPlayer. You can connect up to six devices simultaneously.\n\nNord has added support for the faster WireGuard protocol in NordLynx, making it one of the fastest VPN services out there. However, it’s only available on the ‘IKE’ version of the app, which only offers a permanently enabled kill switch. To have more control, you’ll need to download the ‘OpenVPN’ version, albeit with slightly slower speeds.\n\n    5,300 servers\n    6 simultaneous connections\n    24/7 tech support\n    Kill Switch\n    Works with Netflix & other streaming services\n\nNord frequently has deals on offer that save money on the usual monthly price if you take advantage of the two-year plan. NordVPN offers three tiers: Standard, Plus and Complete. Plus adds Nord’s Password Manager and Data Breach Scanner, while Complete also comes with 1TB of encrypted cloud storage. See all prices and plans at NordVPN.com.\n\n2. Surfshark \n\nSurfshark is a great-value VPN that offers quite a lot features beyond the core VPN service for a low monthly price.\n\nIts apps are easy to use and it reliably unblocks streaming services such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer. It’s missing the specialty servers offered by rivals such as NordVPN, who shares the same parent company, though.\n\nConnection speeds are very impressive, and that’s thanks to the use of the WireGuard protocol. You really won’t notice any slowdown in your internet speed when Surfshark is running, so long as you have WireGuard selected and aren’t using servers the other side of the globe.\n\nThe company has upgraded all its servers so they run entirely in RAM, just like NordVPN and ExpressVPN. Running servers on RAM is better for privacy as data isn’t written to a hard drive. It’s also a member of the VPN Trust Initiative, while two-factor authentication (2FA) is a feature few VPN services offer. Being run from the Netherlands also means this is a privacy-friendly option.\n\nThe other reason to consider Surfshark is because it undercuts almost all of its rivals on price, yet doesn’t place any limit on the number of devices you can use simultaneously. Unfortunately, it can be pricy to renew once your initial contract runs out.\n\nYou can install and use it across many devices including your Mac, PC, Android and iOS devices, as well as browsers.\n\nThere’s a kill switch, a strict no-logs policy and a Multi-Hop feature which routes your connection via two VPN servers for an extra layer of protection. However, there’s no GPS spoofing or split tunnelling on the Mac (the latter being very uncommon on Macs anyway). \n\n    3,200+ RAM-based servers (some are virtual)\n    Multi-Hop connections\n    Unlimited simultaneous connections\n    24/7 customer service\n    Two-factor authentication\n\nIn addition to the VPN there are Alert, Search or Antivirus packages, that are available for an extra cost. \n\n3. CyberGhost\n\n\n\nCyberGhost is one of the biggest names in the VPN industry. It’s affordable and user-friendly, so is perfect for anyone using a VPN on their Mac for the first time.\n\nLike certain rivals, it is constantly adding new servers and the current tally of over 7,000 in 90 countries means you should always be able to get a fast connection. And in our tests, we’ve always seen great speeds from CyberGhost, especially following the introduction of the WireGuard protocol.\n\nCyberGhost is based in Romania, which is good for privacy. Deloitte has audited CyberGhost’s privacy claims and found no issues.\n\nIt was able to unblock every streaming service we tried including Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer and ITV X (another UK-based service). You can use the service on up to seven devices at the same time\n\nIt works with phones, tablets, browsers and of course your Mac.\n\n    7,000+ servers in 90 countries\n    7 simultaneous connections\n    24/7 customer service\n    Kill switch\n\nThere are tempting deals on two- or three-year subscriptions–such as this 3-year deal, which currently gives you three months extra free. It is a capable VPN that represents very good value for money.\n\n\n4. Private Internet Access\n\n\n\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) is a compelling VPN at a relatively affordable price, making it a decent option for the Mac. Since 2019 it’s been owned by the same people as CyberGhost and Express VPN.\n\nIt has an incredible 33,665 servers across 73 countries–that’s far higher than almost any consumer VPN service. Many of the servers are in the U.S. but you’ll find all the most popular locations. There are also virtual servers, so for example you can choose a virtual server in India, while an actual server in India would have to log user data.\n\nEarlier in 2023 PIA removed its 10-device limit on subscriptions, meaning that there’s now no limit on the number of devices you can connect. \n\nSpeeds are excellent, thanks to the WireGuard protocol. PIA also benefits from a kill switch, a feature that is sometimes left out of Mac VPN services.\n\nSplit tunneling, a feature that allows you to choose which apps are routed outside the VPN tunnel, is available. This is one of the few VPNS that offers this feature for macOS.\n\nIt allows you to access international versions of Netflix, as well as BBC iPlayer while outside the U.K. \n\nThe service doesn’t log any of your details or activity, so even though it is based in the U.S., there’s no data to hand over should the authorities order PIA to do so. It now has had a reassuring Deloitte audit, which should make its U.S. location a non-issue.\n\n    33,000+ servers (RAM only)\n    Unlimited connections\n    24/7 customer service\n    Kill switch enabled by default\n    Split Tunneling\n\nPIA for macOS offers a large number of features that are the same as the Windows version, including a kill switch, advanced split tunneling, an ad- and malware blocker, multi-hop, and support for OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols. It’s so often the case that the macOS version of a VPN has fewer features than the Windows version.\n\nHowever, it’s not perfect. PIA doesn’t support IPv6 connections, which will be frustrating for some, but not a deal-breaker for the great majority of VPN users.\n\nNonetheless, PIA is a solid VPN service at an affordable price. A  two-year subscription works out at only $2.91/£2.37 per month. You also currently get two months extra for free.\n\n5. ExpressVPN \n\nExpressVPN is one of the most accomplished VPN services you can buy. Everything you’d expect from a modern VPN is here, including an effective kill switch, and impressive device support. There was split tunneling for app-by-app protection, but, as with most VPNs, that hasn’t worked since macOS Big Sur. It is extremely easy to set up, with quick access via the menu bar one of the highlights.\n\nExpressVPN has often led the way when it comes to security, but other providers are quickly catching up. It’s no longer the only one with RAM-based servers, while solid device and tech support are the norm whichever service you use. The company carried out almost a dozen audits in 2022, covering its apps and privacy policy\n\nThe Lightway protocol brings big increases to the speeds ExpressVPN is capable of, but its open-source technology many similar services will be able to make use of it. Many of these are significantly more affordable though, with ExpressVPN being one of the more expensive options here.\n\n    5 simultaneous connections\n    24/7 customer service\n    Works with Netflix & other streaming services\n\n6. PureVPN\n\nPureVPN is a service to consider if you need to connect to one or more of the countries which aren’t covered by its rivals.\n\nPureVPN is now registered in the British Virgin Islands, which is much more privacy friendly than Hong Kong, where it operated previously. There are more than 2,000 servers available across 141 countries (the most of all services listed here).\n\nHowever, some of those are achieved using virtual server locations. Virtual servers are usually rented from a datacentre, which means the VPN company may have less control over them. PureVPN is transparent about which servers are virtual and which are physical – you can see a small ‘v’ next to each virtual server on the PureVPN website. Unfortunately, Mac users do not see this information in the app though, while their PC counterparts to.\n\nVirtual servers will still unblock content as you’d expect. You can also take advantage of the following:\n\n    Kill switch in macOS app\n    140+ countries covered\n    5 simultaneous connections\n    24/7 customer service\n    Works with Netflix & other streaming services\n\nPureVPN used to log session information but these days operates a strict no-logs policy.\n\nStandard monthly pricing isn’t that attractive for any VPN service, but like its rivals PureVPN always offers great deals if you’re happy to sign up for multiple years.\n\nYou can find out more in our full PureVPN review, and see PureVPN offers here\n\n7. ProtonVPN \n\n\n\nProtonVPN is an impressive VPN. It starts with a free tier with very limited features, is easy to understand, offers a collection of interesting features and great speeds.\n\nThe free tier has restrictions on the number of servers you can choose, and the speeds on offer though. You just get a choice of three countries (U.S., Netherlands and Japan) and speeds aren’t as good as the paid-for version. The free version may be enough if you just want an extra layer of privacy, for which iCloud Private Relay may be sufficient. If you want more than that, say to unblock Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer and others, you will need to pay for it.\n\nThose who pay for ProtonVPN get access to excellent speeds and can also use ‘Secure Core servers’ which route a connection through multiple servers improving privacy. As well as the standard options for connecting to the fastest server and a random server, you can create your own.\n\nProtonVPN is based in Switzerland, which has favorable privacy laws. Swiss law doesn’t require the saving of any logs, and won’t force ProtonVPN to spy on any specific users. The results of an independent audit by Securitum have been published online. ProtonVPN uses its own DNS servers to increase privacy. Proton’s also offers anonymous email addresses for signing up privately.\n\nOther extras include NetShield with DNS filtering to offer protection from malware-infested websites, ads and trackers.\n\n    1900+ servers in 65+ countries\n    Use 10 devices at the same time\n    Includes NetShield malware and tracker blocker\n    Internet kill switch\n    One of the fastest VPN we’ve tested on macOS\n\nProtonVPN is an excellent service with fast speeds, the right privacy promises, a good amount of features including support for streaming services, and fair pricing. It’s well worth a look. Alongside the free tier are Plus (just the VPN) and Unlimited (a bundle that adds email, calendar and 500GB of cloud storage.)\n\nIf you aren’t a power user requiring a VPN for privacy and security, there are plenty of VPNs that will do what you need for less though. The high price is a big disadvantage here and the free version is too limited to be useful.\n\n\n8. FastestVPN \n\n\nThis easy-to-use, attractive, and uncomplicated app is a great option for VPN newbs. In addition to its straightforward and uncluttered design, FastestVPN also offers good speeds and a sufficiently expansive network. It’s icing on the cake that its privacy policy is easy to understand and makes all the right promises.\n\nIn our tests, FastestVPN maintained about 30 percent of the base speed across five locations on multiple test days, although there were some weak spots in Asia and Australia.\n\n    Supports 10 simultaneous connections\n    32 country connections with more than 250 servers\n    Internet kill switch blocks all online traffic if VPN connection drops\n\nDespite it’s name it’s not the fastest VPN, but FastestVPN does make the right privacy promises in a way that’s easy to understand.\n\n9. Hide.me \n\n\n\nHide.me is another VPN service that has improved considerably in recent years.\n\nAs well as offering a completely free version (which none of its rivals here do), it has also added WireGuard, which is considerably faster than other encryption protocols.\n\nOther key features include a customizable kill switch and split tunneling. Hide.me is the only VPN to offer Split Tunnelling in macOS. They state on their website: “hide.me VPN for macOS supports split tunneling. You can configure it in the client’s settings.”\n\nHide.me also offers Stealth Guard, which stops selected apps from running without the security of a VPN connection.\n\nIt can unblock Netflix and allows you to access BBC iPlayer from outside the UK. There’s also solid device support, with up to 10 simultaneous connections permitted.\n\n    1900+ servers in 47 countries\n    Kill switch\n    Split tunneling\n    24/7 live chat\n    10 simultaneous connections\n    Free version\n\nMalaysia-based, in recent years it has expanded the number of servers and doubled the number of countries it covers. Unfortunately the third-party audit hasn’t been updated since 2015\n\nHowever, the user interface on Mac is a bit clunky, and we’re still waiting for an update to the 2015 no-logs policy certification.\n\n\n10. VyprVPN \n\nVyprVPN offers everything most people are looking for in a VPN, without needing to spend much money.\n\nYou get fast WireGuard speeds, alongside separate protocols focused on reliability, anti-censorship and ease of use. It’s also excellent at unblocking geo-restricted content, whether that’s local versions of Netflix or BBC iPlayer & ITV Hub from outside the UK. Premium features such as split tunneling and a kill switch are here too, even if the latter can’t be customised. \n\nVyprVPN’s no-logs policy has been independently audited, and the service adheres to a strict Privacy Policy from parent company Golden Frog. More than 700 servers in over 70 countries should be plenty for most people, although there’s often only one per country. It’s also not clear which of these are physical and virtual.\n\n    Kill switch and split tunneling\n    WireGuard protocol means fast speeds\n    30 simultaneous connections\n    Works with Netflix & other streaming services\n\nNonetheless, it’s still speedy, reliable and affordable – especially if you don’t mind subscribing for three years. That 36-month plan will set you back just $1.81/£1.36 per month, representing excellent value for money.\n\n11. Malwarebytes Privacy VPN (Mac)\n\n\n\nMalwarebytes, probably best known for antivirus software and advice, also offers a standalone VPN service called Malwarebytes Privacy. It’s an easy to use app with the right kind of privacy promises – as you’d expect from a respected name in security based in the U.S.\n\n    Offers 32 country locations\n    More than 245 servers\n\nIn our tests Malwarebytes was a mid-tier performer in terms of speeds, but it should be good enough for most casual users.\n\nMalwarebytes Privacy VPN does a good job and, starting at $3.33/£2.50 a month for one device, the price is right.\n\n\n12. Ivacy \n\n\n\nIvacy doesn’t have as many servers as some of the options here, but it is a well-established VPN service which offers apps for macOS, iOS alongside other devices you may own. Its network isn’t the largest, but still offers servers in all the countries you are likely to want to pretend to be located in.\n\nWireGuard support is apparently coming, but for now the best speeds are via OpenVPN. It is headquartered in Singapore and hasn’t had its privacy policy independently audited.\n\n    Over 3,500 servers in over 100 countries\n    5 simultaneous connections\n    Unblocks local versions of Netflix and BBC iPlayer\n\nSpeeds are decent, and support is responsive via 24/7 live chat. And with amazingly low prices, it’s a solid choice. However, the Mac app is a pale imitation of the Windows version, with only one protocol available on Mac, plus you miss out on split tunneling and a kill switch.\n\n\n13. Atlas VPN\n\n\n\nAtlasVPN is actually owned by Nord Security (which also owns NordVPN and Surfshark). Atlas is the cheapest Nord-owned option, it also offers a completely free plan. Free users get access to servers in the US and Europe, but the speeds you’ll get won’t be as fast as paid customers. Everyone else gets access to a small number of servers in popular countries.\n\n    1,900+ servers in 67 countries\n    10 simultaneous connections\n    Unblocked Netflix, Amazon, iPlayer, Disney+ and more\n    24/7 live chat support\n    Kill switch\n\nBeing based in the U.S. means it suffers from the unfavorable privacy laws there. Atlas VPN claims not to log any data though.\n\nAtlas VPN supports IPv6 (unlike most VPNs). It also allows unlimited connections, so it can be used on multiple devices.\n\nUnfortunately, while it’ll let us watch Netflix, HBO Max and other big names, it didn’t unblock BBC iPlayer, and some other services.\n\n\n14. Hidden24\n\n\n\nHidden24 is designed from the ground up to offer the ultimate in privacy.\n\nThere are seven server locations to choose from: U.S., U.K., Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden. Those servers run custom code, unlike most VPN servers which use open source software on top of Linux. Not even Hidden24’s staff can access those servers. Hidden24 also logs nothing. This is all great for privacy, one drawback is that you’re restricted to using just one device at a time. To get around that you could configure a compatible router with Hidden24 and connect all your devices to that router.\n\nIn our tests Hidden24 reliably unblocked Netflix, iPlayer and other streaming services which are available in the seven countries it supports.\n\n    7 servers in 7 countries\n    1 simultaneous connection\n    Unblocked Netflix, iPlayer and more\n\nIt’s a good cheap option if your priority is privacy over other features.\n\nTo test upload and download speeds, we close down all background internet processes on the Mac, using TripMode. The only traffic on the system able to upload or download any data is Ookla. We use this setup to ensure that the numbers that Ookla produced were not stymied by anything else that the computer may have been doing at the time. The speeds Ookla captured were then averaged, providing us with a final numeric score.\n\nWe then use those scores to calculate a percentage of difference in speeds, which is what you’ll see in our reviews. Since internet speeds change constantly based on server load, how fast your connection is, and a gazillion other factors, we feel this provides a better picture of what you can expect from a service, on the whole, than merely quoting the exact upload/download speeds we encountered during testing.\n\nSpeed isn’t the only quantifiable metric that we look at. The number of countries that a VPN offers servers in, total number of servers worldwide, and how much it’ll cost you to connect to those servers on a monthly or annual basis are also taken into consideration when recommending a \nVPN service to you.\n\nAdditionally, we conduct hours of research into the VPN providers to find out who owns them, where they’re based, what they do with subscriber information, and whether the provider has a track record of questionable business practices.\n\nA VPN creates an encrypted digital tunnel between your computer and the server of the VPN service you choose to use. Once this tunnel has been established, your web searches, the sites you access, and the information you submit online will be hidden from prying eyes. This means that your ISP can’t log or sell your information and hackers using the same network as you will find it difficult to initiate an attack on you. Almost no one will have any idea of what information you’re accessing.\n\nWhat a VPN can’t do\n\nA VPN can’t protect you from viruses, malware, or ransomware attacks if you choose to download an infected file, or a visit site designed to inject your computer with malignant code. It won’t keep spoofed sites from stealing your personal information, if you happen to visit one. So, you’ll want to bone up on online security best practices.\n\nYou should know that while using a VPN will allow you to anonymously engage in peer-to-peer file-sharing/torrenting, some service providers may cancel your VPN subscription or turn over your information to the authorities if they catch you trading copyrighted material with others.\n\nWhat to look for in a VPN\n\nA clear privacy policy. A good VPN should offer an easy-to-understand privacy policy that outlines what, if any, information the company collects from its users. It’s important that this policy details what they do with this information. Some VPN providers, especially those that offer their services for free, sell their user information to advertisers and other interested parties, just like an ISP does. Choose a provider that offers a level of privacy that suits you.\n\nKnow where the provider is based. Many countries have no laws demanding that VPN providers maintain logs of their users’ activity. This makes maintaining your privacy more assurable than it would be if you use a VPN located in a country that requires that user-activity records be maintained. Some companies, in an effort to make their network of servers look bigger or more varied than it actually is, spoof the locations of their servers.\n\nThe more servers, the merrier. Choosing a VPN provider with a ton of servers around the world is important for a couple of reasons. First, having a multitude of servers to choose from means that you won’t be forced to connect to an overpopulated server where the data flows like mud.\n\nSecond, having a wealth of servers to choose from both at home and internationally means more opportunities for spoofing your location, allowing you to hide where you are or access region-locked content with ease.\n\nMultiple payment options. It’s a vicious circle. Paying for a VPN with a credit card online before you have access to a VPN could allow your financial information to fall into the wrong hands. Look for providers that offer alternative payment options such as PayPal, Bitcoin, AliPay, or via the Mac App Store.\n\nAn easy-to-use interface. It takes a lot of digital wizardry to connect to a VPN. Some people want to see how their VPN operates, behind the scenes. Using an open source VPN client like Tunnelblick is great for this. Most folks, however, just want their VPN to work with minimal frustration. Look for a VPN service that offers a Mac client with an easy-to-use interface.\n\nProtection for all of your devices. A good VPN service will offer licenses for multiple devices to protect your loved ones’ computers as well as your personal smartphone and tablet. To this end, before investing in a VPN subscription, make sure that it provides software clients for all of the devices you own.What’s a VPN?\n\nVPN stands for virtual private network. If you’re not using a VPN, when your computer connects to the internet, it does so through the local gateway provided by your internet service provider (ISP). Doing this allows you to connect to all of the online services you use everyday.\n\nHowever, connecting this way also allows an ISP to know your physical location based on where you access the internet—be it at home, at work, in a cafe, or at a public Wi-Fi hotspot. This information is often sold to marketers and other parties interested in getting to know more about you and your browsing habits.\n\nWorse still, if you connect to the internet through an access point with weak security, such as at an airport, mall, or local library, hackers connected to the same network could intercept personal information like your social media passwords or banking credentials through what’s called a man-in-the-middle attack. A VPN service can help prevent all of that.\n\nHow we tested VPNs\n\nFor each VPN service we review, we conduct tests at three different times of the day: morning, afternoon, and evening, using Ookla Speedtest. We start by measuring the speed of our unprotected internet connection before testing the upload/download speeds of the VPN service. These tests are conducted to servers located in North America, the UK, Europe, Oceana, and Asia over an ethernet connection with a service provision of 100Mbps.\n\nTo test upload and download speeds, we close down all background internet processes on the Mac, using TripMode. The only traffic on the system able to upload or download any data is Ookla. We use this setup to ensure that the numbers that Ookla produced were not stymied by anything else that the computer may have been doing at the time. The speeds Ookla captured were then averaged, providing us with a final numeric score.\n\nWe then use those scores to calculate a percentage of difference in speeds, which is what you’ll see in our reviews. Since internet speeds change constantly based on server load, how fast your connection is, and a gazillion other factors, we feel this provides a better picture of what you can expect from a service, on the whole, than merely quoting the exact upload/download speeds we encountered during testing.\n\nSpeed isn’t the only quantifiable metric that we look at. The number of countries that a VPN offers servers in, total number of servers worldwide, and how much it’ll cost you to connect to those servers on a monthly or annual basis are also taken into consideration when recommending a VPN service to you.\n\nAdditionally, we conduct hours of research into the VPN providers to find out who owns them, where they’re based, what they do with subscriber information, and whether the provider has a track record of questionable business practices.\n \nWhat’s a VPN?\n\nVPN stands for virtual private network. If you’re not using a VPN, when your computer connects to the internet, it does so through the local gateway provided by your internet service provider (ISP). Doing this allows you to connect to all of the online services you use everyday.\n\nHowever, connecting this way also allows an ISP to know your physical location based on where you access the internet—be it at home, at work, in a cafe, or at a public Wi-Fi hotspot. This information is often sold to marketers and other parties interested in getting to know more about you and your browsing habits.\n\nWorse still, if you connect to the internet through an access point with weak security, such as at an airport, mall, or local library, hackers connected to the same network could intercept personal information like your social media passwords or banking credentials through what’s called a man-in-the-middle attack. A VPN service can help prevent all of that.\n\nA VPN creates an encrypted digital tunnel between your computer and the server of the VPN service you choose to use. Once this tunnel has been established, your web searches, the sites you access, and the information you submit online will be hidden from prying eyes. This means that your ISP can’t log or sell your information and hackers using the same network as you will find it difficult to initiate an attack on you. Almost no one will have any idea of what information you’re accessing.\n\nWhat a VPN can’t do\n\nA VPN can’t protect you from viruses, malware, or ransomware attacks if you choose to download an infected file, or a visit site designed to inject your computer with malignant code. It won’t keep spoofed sites from stealing your personal information, if you happen to visit one. So, you’ll want to bone up on online security best practices.\n\nYou should know that while using a VPN will allow you to anonymously engage in peer-to-peer file-sharing/torrenting, some service providers may cancel your VPN subscription or turn over your information to the authorities if they catch you trading copyrighted material with others.\n\nWhat to look for in a VPN\n\nA clear privacy policy. A good VPN should offer an easy-to-understand privacy policy that outlines what, if any, information the company collects from its users. It’s important that this policy details what they do with this information. Some VPN providers, especially those that offer their services for free, sell their user information to advertisers and other interested parties, just like an ISP does. Choose a provider that offers a level of privacy that suits you.\n\nKnow where the provider is based. Many countries have no laws demanding that VPN providers maintain logs of their users’ activity. This makes maintaining your privacy more assurable than it would be if you use a VPN located in a country that requires that user-activity records be maintained. Some companies, in an effort to make their network of servers look bigger or more varied than it actually is, spoof the locations of their servers.\n\nThe more servers, the merrier. Choosing a VPN provider with a ton of servers around the world is important for a couple of reasons. First, having a multitude of servers to choose from means that you won’t be forced to connect to an overpopulated server where the data flows like mud.\n\nSecond, having a wealth of servers to choose from both at home and internationally means more opportunities for spoofing your location, allowing you to hide where you are or access region-locked content with ease.\n\nMultiple payment options. It’s a vicious circle. Paying for a VPN with a credit card online before you have access to a VPN could allow your financial information to fall into the wrong hands. Look for providers that offer alternative payment options such as PayPal, Bitcoin, AliPay, or via the Mac App Store.\n\nAn easy-to-use interface. It takes a lot of digital wizardry to connect to a VPN. Some people want to see how their VPN operates, behind the scenes. Using an open source VPN client like Tunnelblick is great for this. Most folks, however, just want their VPN to work with minimal frustration. Look for a VPN service that offers a Mac client with an easy-to-use interface.\n\nProtection for all of your devices. A good VPN service will offer licenses for multiple devices to protect your loved ones’ computers as well as your personal smartphone and tablet. To this end, before investing in a VPN subscription, make sure that it provides software clients for all of the devices you own.",

        "articleBody": "Interest rates will still rule stocks in 2024, according to DataTrek Research. \n\nWall Street seems to agree that U.S. stocks will climb to fresh record highs in 2024. But the most important question for investors may still be the direction and speed of interest-rate moves. \n\nRate-sensitive groups of stocks with lackluster fundamentals, such as financials, utilities, staples, “may be able to outperform, at least early in the year,” if one expects interest rates “to come down quickly and permanently,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\nBut if “one expects a bumpier ride on the rate front,” then stronger groups, like technology and tech-adjacent sectors “should do better,” Colas said in a Monday client note.\n\nThe S&P 500’s utilities, consumer staples and energy sectors have been the worst performing parts of the large-cap benchmark index so far in 2023, according to FactSet data.\n\nWith an over 10% year-to-date decline, the S&P 500’s utilities sector XX:SP500.55 has significantly underperformed the broader index’s SPX 23.6% advance.\n\nThe S&P 500’s best performing information technology sector XX:SP500.45 was up 56.5% for the same period. But its consumer staples XX:SP500.30 and energy XX:SP500.10 sectors have slumped by 2.6% and 4.1% so far this year, respectively, according to FactSet data.\n\nUtilities and consumer staples are usually considered defensive investment sectors, or “bond proxies,” because they can help investors minimize stock-market losses in any economic downturn. Companies in these sectors usually provide electricity, water and gas, or they sell products and services that consumers regularly purchase, regardless of economic conditions.\n\nHowever, utilities and consumer staples stocks were under a lot of pressure this year. A relentless climb in U.S. Treasury yields in October made defensive stocks less attractive compared with government-issued bonds, or money-market funds offering 5%, especially as the economy remained strong, pushing recession expectations out further.\n\nColas expects “weaker groups” to catch a stronger tailwind if rates continue to decline.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y last week booked its biggest weekly decline in a year after the Federal Reserve signaled a pivot to rate cuts in 2024, which helped the S&P 500 score its longest weekly winning streak since 2017.\n\nThe S&P 500’s utilities and consumer staples sectors rose 0.9% and 1.6% last week, respectively, compared with the information technology sector’s 2.5% advance and communication services sector’s XX:SP500.50 0.1% decline, according to FactSet data.\n\nEarnings growth expectations for each S&P 500 sector in 2024 are indicated below. Sectors to the left of the dotted black line are expected to show better bottom-line results than the S&P 500 as a whole, while those to the right are expected to show weaker earnings growth. \n\nWall Street expects next year to see 11.5% growth in S&P 500 earnings-per-share (EPS), to $244, and 5.5% revenue growth, according to FactSet data.\n\nHowever, there is a wide dispersion across S&P 500 sectors. The range goes from 2% revenue and 3% earnings growth for the energy sector, to 9% revenue and 17% earnings growth for the information technology sector, according to data compiled by DataTrek Research.\n\n“Playing fundamentally weaker sectors therefore assumes even more good news on the rate front,” Colas said, adding that it still is riskier than sticking with “tried and true groups” like technology.\n\nMoreover, sectors such as utilities, financials and consumer staples are not expected to show 10% earnings growth next year, while health care and big tech-dominated groups like communication services, technology and consumer discretionary, are expected to show much better than average revenue and earnings growth in 2024, said Colas, citing FactSet data. \n\nU.S. stocks closed higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA building on its all-time high set last week. The S&P 500 gained 0.5% and the Dow Industrials closed fractionally higher. The Nasdaq Composite COMP finished up 0.6%, according to FactSet data.",

        "articleBody": "From a fruit-forward expression from Metallica’s Blackened label to a whiskey collab with Jean-Michel Basquiat’s estate.\n\nSo far this week we’ve covered the best in rye and American single malts for 2023, crowning two best-in-category bottles along the way. Today we turn our attention to double barrels, or second finishes, one of the more interesting and diverse ways whiskey magicians can play with their spells—tweaking flavor notes with a bit of port wood here, or some months in extra añejo tequila casks there. As these experimentation methods advance, truly innovative distillers are imagining even more creative barrels to modify flavors with—including some entries below where we find barrels that held oolong tea, ginja berry liquor, maple syrup and more. \n\nBest Double-Barrel of 2023: Rabbit Hole ‘Dareringer’ Founder’s Collection\n\nThe latest incarnation of Rabbit Hole’s highly coveted Founder’s Collection is the whiskey equivalent of a long walk in the woods. Those woods being, specifically, the Pedro Ximénez sherry casks in which founder Kaveh Zamanian aged his impeccably crafted whiskey: a 60-year-old American white oak with historic provenance.\n\nFor six decades this wood held and aged a succession of PX sherry, brandy and sherry wines, soaking in complex flavors that would one day be used by Zamanian to age what would become his fourth Founder’s Collection. The barrels, coopered by the Cabello family of the Casknolia Cooperage in Córdoba, Spain, bid their time in the houses of three of Spain’s most venerable and revered vintners.\n\n2XO ‘The Phoenix Blend’ Bourbon\n\nDixon Dedman made his name in the whiskey world resurrecting the Kentucky Owl label in 2014, sourcing award-winning juice and selling it only in Kentucky. It grew like wildfire, Stoli came in and invested, and soon Dedman moved on to new endeavors. To whit he introduces his new label 2XO (aka “Two Times Oak”) — a literal explanation of its ethos, which will be to use double-barrel bourbons in every expression. His first, aptly dubbed 2XO The Phoenix Blend, looked to mirror the path he walked with Kentucky Owl in crafting a coveted, immaculately blended bourbon. As Dedman told us: “That’s my jam—blending.”\n\nHe starts with two bourbons from different distilleries, each with different mash bills: the first a very high rye mash bill architected by renowned whiskey genius Jim Rutledge, the other with more moderate rye count—blended and then re-barreled into new charred American oak barrels to highlight traditional bourbon flavors like caramel, vanilla and red apple. The Phoenix Blend excels sensually with its deep amber color, oily mouthfeel and bulls-eye bourbon notes. $100. \n\nGreat Jones x Jean Michel Basquiat Pineau de Charentes Wine Cask Finished Bourbon\n\nBeing the first legal distillery in Manhattan since Prohibition, Great Jones Distilling Co. takes great pride in its NYC roots. So while it’s not surprising they’d want to collaborate with the estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat, one of the city’s—and 20th century’s—greatest artists. Basquiat’s estate lends his work to three bottles of Great Jones Straight Bourbon, one each with his famed “Pez Dispenser” Dinosaur, Skull (“Untitled, 1982”) and Crown (“Untitled, 1982”).\n\nGreat Jones started with their signature mash bill of locally-grown New York rye, malted barley and corn, aged no less than seven years, then finished the juice in Pineau de Charentes casks—a rare fortified wine that blends fresh-pressed grape juice with Cognac eau-de-vie. The wine-soaked wood lends Great Jones’ bourbon autumnal flavors of red apple, cinnamon and allspice. With a price point of only $45, these bourbons might also be the most affordable thing you’ll likely ever find featuring Basquiat’s artwork.\n\nBlackened x Rabbit Hole ‘Masters of Whiskey Series’ Bourbon Finished in Calvados Casks\n\nBlackened Master Distiller and Blender, Rob Dietrich, and the Metallica boys team up with Kaveh Zamanian and his Rabbit Hole crew to create the latest in Blackened’s “Masters of Whiskey Series.” The project began with a sourced 13-year-old straight Tennessee bourbon (64% corn / 36% rye) married with Zamanian’s own Rabbit Hole Heigold High Rye Double Malt Kentucky Straight bourbon (70% corn / 25% malted rye / 5% malted barley). \n\nThe blend was then finished in ex-Calvados casks, adding particular notes (e.g. ripe pear, cinnamon, field clover, honey and black walnut) that appealed to Dietrich and Zamanian, both known for their out-of-the-box thinking and eagerness to explore new territories in flavor. Since it’s a Blackened release the Calvados casks were blasted with Metallica tracks while resting to instigate sonic-enhancement, aka dynamic aging from the heavy vibes (and soundwaves).\n\nBlackened x Rabbit Hole “Masters of Whiskey Series” Bourbon Finished in Calvados Casks was then bottled at cask strength, non-chill filtered of course, with an SRP of $160.\n\nBreckenridge Distillery ‘Pedro Ximenez’ Bourbon\n\nRecognized as the “World’s Highest Distillery” (located some 9,600 feet up in the Rockies), Colorado’s own Breckenridge Distillery is best known for its bourbon—a four-time World Whiskies Awards “Best American Blended” winner (2016 through 2019), and the IWSC’s Bourbon of the Year in 2011.\n\nFor 2023 Breckenridge dropped a duo of new cask-finished experiments: one soaking up the wood of their own aged Colorado Rum casks, the other centuries-old Spanish solera Pedro Ximenez barrels. While the rum had its moment, the Breckenridge Distillery “Pedro Ximenez” Bourbon bottled at 45% ABV continues the Colorado distillery’s excellence in bourbon experimentations. $60.\n\nWoodinville ‘Ginja’ Straight Bourbon Whiskey\n\nEver year Woodinville drops a blazingly popular “Harvest Release”—a distillery-only whiskey sold only from the shelves of their Woodinville Tasting Room. Launched in November of 2011, the annual release has become a high holiday for #whiskeynerds everywhere. \n\nRecent drops include the 2017 Woodinville Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished with Toasted Applewood Staves, and more recently their 2021 Harvest Release bourbon finished in 200-gallon Moscatel De Setúbal barrels—a rare fortified wine produced in Portugal’s Setúbal Peninsula.\n\nNow for 2023 the Washington state distillery—named “Craft Whiskey of the Year” by the American Distilling Institute—gets even freakier. Starting with their flagship bourbon (72% corn / 22% rye / 6% malted barley), always aged a minimum of five years, they then dump the juice into ultra-rare freshly emptied ginjinha barrels. A Portuguese liquor made of sour cherries called ginja berries, unsurprisingly the ginjinha barrels adds strong notes of boysenberry jam and dark cherry along with cinnamon to the overall palate. \n\nWhile you could only find the “Ginja” Straight Bourbon at the official Woodinville Tasting Room in Washington state, it sold out instantly so you’ll have to scour the gray market for this rare find. \n\nJ Henry & Sons Wisconsin Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished In Maple Syrup Barrels\n\nA couple things make J Henry’s one of the more unique whiskeys out there—the most fundamental arguably being their chosen strain of corn: an heirloom red first grown by Joe Henry’s father on their small family farm in Dane, Wisconsin, way back in the 1940s. That strain was thought to be extinct until they found out UW-Madison had preserved it, so the family reintroduced it to their soil—where the Henrys also grow all their own rye and wheat.\n\nThe family’s 5-Year Bourbon is the flagship brown, but Joe, Liz and sons also do a great job of experimenting with second cask finishes—such as with their La Flamme Reserve from a couple years back, a blend of their five- and six-year-old whiskey finished for 13 months in Armagnac casks. Now the fam are back at it, this time finishing their Wisconsin Straight Bourbon (64% J Henry heirloom red corn / 14% spooner rye / 14% winter wheat / 8% malted barley) in barrels they had previously lent maple syrup producers they partnered with from Wisconsin’s Northwoods. \n\nSo the maple farmers got ex-bourbon barrels to age their syrup, and J Henry & Sons received in return pure maple-soaked wood to influence their whiskey—a win-win. “That process helps to impart that delicious maple flavor into the wood,” Head Blender Joe Z Henry (one of the Sons) explains. “Then we finished select barrels of bourbon in these maple bourbon casks, infusing the rich sweetness of pure Wisconsin maple syrup into our luxurious, Wisconsin bourbon whiskey.” \n\nWhistlePig x Alfa Romeo F1 Team Wind Tunnel-Trialed Rye Whiskey\n\nWhistlePig’s collaboration with Alfa Romeo’s F1 team was a project we could not ignore. The efficiently named WhistlePig x Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake Wind Tunnel-Trialed Rye Whiskey incorporates elements inspired from both of Alfa F1’s drivers. First, it tips a cap to the sport’s first Chinese F1 driver, Zhou Guanyu, by finishing the rye in barrels seasoned with two very unique Asian-inspired elements: lychee and oolong tea. Second, WhistlePig then bottled the stuff at 96.77 proof, a reference to superb Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas’ “77” racing number.\n\nBut the most eye-catching nod to the apex motorsport is the fact WhistlePig ran barrels in the same Alfa Romeo F1 team’s wind tunnel in Hinwil, Switzerland where they test their C43 racecar. Select barrels filled with whiskey then “endured varying levels of g-forces at the WhistlePig farm and distillery” for the final touch. How exactly was this accomplished, you may be wondering? According to WhistlePig, by “rolling a barrel through the rye fields, tying it to the back of a tractor while doing donuts around the farm, and racing it around on the back of a barrel-mobile.” Sounds like a fun weekend in Shoreham, Vermont.\n\nMuch like their Roadstock Rye we covered exactly two years ago—a rye that criss-crossed America twice, traveling 6,000 miles in WhistlePig’s Rolling Rickhouse semi-truck—it seems the WhistlePig team share a soft spot for #hooniganism. Whether it’s doing donuts in a whiskey-fueled Hellcat or rolling barrels through their rye fields for dynamic aging, WhistlePig clearly gets a lot of thrills from burnt rubber. $50.\n\nChicken Cock ‘Red Stave’ Bourbon\n\nRelaunched in 2012 under the watchful eye of Master Distiller Gregg Snyder, Chicken Cock is a whiskey maker with roots that date all the way back to 1856 in Paris, Kentucky. They craft a great core Kentucky Straight Bourbon and Straight Rye via a collaborative distilling program with Bardstown Bourbon Company, and then make some fun LTOs with their creative finishing program. Last year’s Island Rooster Rum Barrel Rye finished their rye in Caribbean rum casks. Now, new for 2023, Chicken Cock took their aforementioned bourbon and poured it into J. Wilkes Petite Sirah barrels sourced from the Miller Family Wine Company.\n\nAptly dubbed Chicken Cock Red Stave Bourbon, the Petite Sirah crafted in the storied California winemaking region of the Paso Robles Highlands is among Cali’s most famous. The second finishing allows the wine-soaked wood to gift Chicken Cock’s Bourbon both a crimson tint on top of a plum and cherry flavor influence. Chicken Cock “Red Stave” Bourbon comes bottled at 51.2% ABV (102.4 proof) with a $200 SRP.\n\nAngel’s Envy Cask Strength Straight Bourbon Finished in Port Wine Barrels 2023\n\nFor a dozen straight years, Angel’s Envy has released a thirstily anticipated Cask Strength Kentucky Straight Bourbon Finished in Port Wine Barrels, much to the joy of discriminating bourbon fans worldwide. While this happens annually, each year’s expression is a unique vintage, meaning Angel’s Envy aficionados will hunt them to extinction. New for 2023 the Louisville, Kentucky distillery added their first-ever limited-edition Straight Rye Whiskey captured at cask strength, aged in both Sauternes and toasted oak barrels.\n\nTheir Cask Strength Straight Bourbon Finished in Port Wine Barrels continues Angel’s Envy’s proud bourbon and port heritage by once again hand-picking the very best honey barrels from their rick houses and adding an extra (and unspecified) maturation in barrels imported from Portugal. For 2023 all 22,656 bottles of the bourbon come bottled at 59.1% ABV (118.2-proof). While each expression is different year-to-year, they all share one thing in common: accolades. 2022’s release captured Platinum and Innovation Awards from the SIP Awards, Double Gold from SFWSC and Gold at the ASCOT Awards.\n\nGarrison Brothers Guadalupe 2023 Port Cask Finished Bourbon\n\nWe’ve sung the praises of Garrison Brothers many a time on these pages, and there’s good reason. Outside of Kentucky, Texas has an argument to producing some of the best whiskeys in America—and Garrison Brothers  continuously aim to be amongst the best. They’ve made a big impression by focusing on LTOs like Balmorhea, Laguna Madre and HoneyDew to keep fans lining up at their Hye distillery, and now you can add Guadalupe to the list.\n\nLast year’s inaugural expression scored Double Gold, Best of Class and Best Straight Bourbon at the 2022 Craft Distillers Competition; Gold at the 2022 International Spirits Competition; Double Gold at the 2022 New York International Spirits Competition and many more awards. This year should be as acclaimed, as Garrison Bros founder Dan Garrison and his Master Distiller Donnis Todd have perfected their Guadalupe formula: Start with their award winning bourbon (a sweet mash of food-grade corn, local soft red winter wheat and two-row barley), age it four years in white American oak casks, and then follow that up with two more years in Portugal-sourced tawny port casks. Done and done. \n\nGarrison and Todd think of Guadalupe as a dessert bourbon—its notes of strawberry preserve, ripe plums, honey and blueberry complementing your favorite post-dinner indulgence. Only a little over 15,000 bottles were released after their initial sold-out distillery sale, with an SRP of $150. \n\n15 Stars ‘Sherry Cask Finish’ Bourbon\n\nFather/son 15 Stars founders Rick and Ricky Johnson came out of the gate with the top-shelf Timeless Reserve, a 14-year old whiskey that immediately grabbed bourbon aficionados’ attention. For their second release they blended in some slightly younger (seven-year) bourbon and proofed down just to make their juice more affordable. \n\nThis year they push the aging back up with their Sherry Cask Finish. They take twin bourbons, aged 13 and 10 years, marry them and then finish the blend in casks that held sherry wine. As they named their label after Kentucky (the 15th American state, therefore the 15th star on the flag), it’s clear the Johnson clan wants to do their home state proud. They’ve been awarded in kind, scoring Best Bourbon of 2023, Best Finished Bourbon of 2023, and Double Gold at the 2023 NYWSC with this expression. As always proofed for flavor (57.5% ABV), 15 Stars “Sherry Cask Finish” Bourbon lands with a $180 SRP.  \n\nMichter’s Toasted Barrel Finish Sour Mash Bourbon\n\nMichter’s “Sour Mash” labeling is a bit confusing, as almost all whiskeys on the market are made with sour mash (as sweet mash requires a lot more labor with different taste profiles). Still, it’s an homage to the renowned Sour Mash of the first iteration of Michter’s before it was revived in the late 90s.\n\nWhat sets this expression apart is Michter’s use of a toasted barrels— never charred like most barrels, air-dried for over a year and a half then toasted—to finish the aging. While the beloved Kentucky distillery has been experimenting with such barrels since 2014, they’ve only once publicly released a Toasted Barrel Finish Sour Mash bottle, and that was back in 2019. The 2022 vintage which dropped late last year might become even more popular, as the toasted barrels add eucalyptus, toasted almond and a touch of oak notes to Michter’s signature vanilla, butterscotch and toffee base. Expect to pay triple the $100 SRP.",

For their 10th Edition the Vermont distillery went Biblical. \n\nIts Boss Hog X: The Commandments takes inspiration from the New Testament, specifically from the birth of Christ and the legend of the 3 Wise Men. \n\nThe whiskey starts with WhistlePig’s traditional Straight Rye Whiskey aged in new American Oak, but then gets weird via two additional finishes. The first re-cask is in barrels seasoned with an experimental rye and whey spirit WhistlePig created, which was infused with frankincense and myrrh resins—two of the three gifts the Wise Men brought for little baby Jesus (the third being gold). \n\n“We’d been interested in exploring resins for some time as a new way to harness the flavor of trees through wood,” explains Meghan Ireland, WhistlePig’s Whiskey Blender, of the inspiration to play with resins in the finishing process.\n\n“After many trials around specific resins and how exactly to capture those flavors in the secondary aging process, we landed on two of the most famous ones: frankincense and myrrh.\n\n“These brought incredible notes of crème brûlée, lemongrass and rosemary to the final whiskey, and fueled a disruptive story to help bring to life the whiskey journey under the theme of The Commandments.”\n\nAfter being blessed by these holy resins, the rye was then transferred to casks that held craft mead, which conjured its own magic by adding notes of red berries and freshly crushed black pepper, as well as rounding out the body of the potent rye (bottled at proof between 52.6-53.5% ABV/105.3-107 proof). \n\nTurns out playing with resins isn’t be easy, as the gooey and sticky consistency could prove challenging. \n\n“After the initial trials with resins, I began to doubt whether it was possible to harness them for maturation,” Ireland reveals when asked about the obstacles her Whistlepig team faced. “Our rye itself packs a mighty, herbaceous punch, so it always takes a lot of experimentation to get the exact complement. Any direct contact with the resins ended up on the ‘whiskey lab floor’ so to speak. \n\n“Our breakthrough was in crafting the whey/rye spirit to carry the resins as a previous fill to the barrels—a discovery well worth the wait,” Ireland continues. “Finally, the pop of honey character from the mead in the final finish really balances it all out.”\n\nUnderstandably the legend of Whistlepig’s crown jewel Boss Hog line only grows, as this latest batch sold out in a mere two hours. Boss Hog X: The Commandments comes packaged in an elaborate revolving door box, replete with a handmade pewter topper of Mortimer Jr.—Whistlepig’s Chief Pig, Lawmaker and Rule Breaker of Rye Whiskey—with a SRP of $600.",

        "authors": "Aaron Klotz",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "Streacom has announced an all-new passively cooled PC chassis called the SG10, capable of cooling up to 600W worth of thermal power. The case was originally unveiled at Computex 2023 as a prototype but is now a finished product ready for production. Pre-orders will begin shortly, with shipping dates of the first SG10 batches estimated to go out as soon as May 2024. Streacom will build two variants: a standard variant featuring an aluminum heatsink and a Copper Edition variant that will be available first to backers of the project. Only 500 Copper Editions units will be produced.\n\nThe SG10 is the most aggressive case Streacom has ever made performance-wise, dissipating an impressive 600W of power without the aid of cooling fans. To do this, Streacom invented a new solid-state heat-pipe cooling system that it claims is more efficient than traditional heatpipe designs. The first part of the system is a uniquely designed loop heat pipe system that enables phase changes to occur in a continuous flow around the loop. This differs from traditional heatpipe designs, where phase changes occur in opposite directions within the tube.\n\nNext is the Evaporator component, which helps boost the heat pipe's cooling capability. It features a patented solid-state capillary pump that pressurizes gasses going into the condenser. The pressurized effect is similar to turbocharging an engine, only in this case, it is improving the heat extraction of the cooling loop instead of making horsepower.\n\nCooling is split into two cooling units (or condensers); the first condenser is dedicated to the CPU, while the other is dedicated entirely to the GPU. Alternatively, if you're building a dual-PC system in this case, the GPU condenser can be re-purposed to cool the CPU in the second system. If the 600W of cooling power is still insufficient, Streacom has gone the extra mile and added an optional rail system that allows 120mm fans to be mounted to the bottom of each condenser — boosting the SG10's cooling capabilities beyond 600W.\n\nSpeaking of build options, another highlight of the SG10 is its modularity. The SG10 features a fully modular bracket system that allows the motherboard(s) and/or graphics card to be moved up or down on rails to accommodate the needs of different builds. The case officially supports Full ATX, Standard ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX motherboards.\n\nDue to its huge passive cooling system and the addition of its rail system, the SG10 features a unique layout that doesn't feature a mid-plate at all. Every single component in the chassis is effectively visible from all sides of the case, including the right side. The motherboard and graphics card are mounted in an angled position, with the motherboard facing the left side panel and the graphics card facing the right direction. This design enables the condensers at the top to grab as much cool air as possible from the chassis down below without much obstruction. The front and rear of the case have virtually no solid panels to speak of. The only material making up the front and rear \"panels\" is a series of metal pillars that support the chassis.\n\nThe SG10 is a case designed for extremely high-end builds and for enthusiasts who love the idea of a completely silent system. The Copper Edition (if you can get your hands on one) will cost a whopping £1200 ($1,300 USD), while the standard version will cost £1000 ($1,100 USD). Again, availability won't be ready until 2024.",

        "articleBody": "Still brown, naturally.\n\nNoctua has yet to create a Noctua-themed version of the Nvidia RTX 4090 (the best GPU you can buy today). So Noctua enthusiasts have been forced to build their own Noctua-themed RTX 4090s, and one such enthusiast has shared photos of their DIY RTX 4090: Noctua Edition on Reddit. This extremely exclusive GPU was created using an Inno3d RTX 4090 iCHILL GPU, Noctua NF-A9 fans, and a 3D printer. \n\nThe mod replaces the stock fans and the shroud on the Inno3d RTX 4090 with Noctua's 92mm NF-A9 fans and a bespoke 3D-printed shroud capable of housing the higher-performance 92mm fans. The results turned out to be pretty good, according to the modder, who reported temperatures were running about 8C cooler with the new configuration.\n\nOne aspect that seems to have helped make the mod so effective is the way the modified shroud was designed by Reddit user ZaME19. Unlike the shrouds you see on most OEM RTX 4090s, this modified shroud doesn't restrict airflow going in or out of the RTX 4090's heatsink. This improves efficiency, giving the air an easy way to travel through the heatsink — a shroud that covers most of the heatsink for aesthetic purposes hurts cooling performance to some degree. \n\nThe fans used for the mod also play a role in improving cooling performance. The NF-A9 PWM fans used are high-performance 92mm fans optimized for air coolers — what Noctua is known for — and have a maximum speed of 2,000 RPM and an airflow rating of 46.4 cubic feet per minute (CFM). They're much wider than normal GPU fans, so they push more air over the heatsink at similar RPMs. \n\nThis RTX 4090 Noctua mod showcases what's possible with 3D printing and higher-performing air cooling fans. While this mod was printed using PLA, some commenters noted that perhaps a different material might be better because PLA starts to warp at relatively low temperatures (60C), while materials like PETG are more robust at higher temperatures. \n\nAnyway, if your RTX 4090 has lackluster stock cooling performance, or you're just looking for a better air cooling experience for overclocking, 3D-printing your own cooling solution seems like a sensible way to boost performance (as for material, our best filaments page can point you in the right direction).",

        "authors": "Jay Weaver",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A former Colombian soldier who attended a strategic meeting just before the assassination of Haiti’s president and joined in the deadly assault pleaded guilty Friday, making him the fifth of 11 defendants in the FBI’s case to accept responsibility and assist U.S. authorities.\n\nMario Antonio Palacios Palacios, 45, had fled to Jamaica more than two months after the July 7, 2021 assassination and became the first suspect to surrender to FBI agents in January of last year after initially confessing to FBI agents at a Kingston hotel — {a confession that he and his lawyers later claimed was given under duress.} But Palacios chose to accept responsibility for his supporting role in the murder conspiracy targeting Haitian President Jovenel Moïse before a judge could rule on his bid to throw out the confession.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Palacios admitted during a nearly six-hour video-recorded interview with federal agents in October 2021 that he took a necklace, two watches, $2,060 cash and other personal items belonging to Moïse, and his wife, Martine, when he was killed and she was injured in the assault at their hillside home outside Port-au-Prince.\nAt Friday’s hearing, Palacios pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to kill Haiti’s president, providing that support himself, and conspiring to kill a person outside the United States. He faces up to a life sentence before U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez on March 1.\n\nHowever, unlike four other defendants who have pleaded guilty so far, Palacios played a “minor role,” federal prosecutors Andrea Goldbarg and Monica Castro said, because he was not involved in making strategic decisions about the assassination plot. That factor, along with his cooperation, might help him ultimately receive less than a life sentence in the future.\nCiting a factual statement filed with his plea agreement, Goldbarg said Palacios retired from the Colombian military in June 2021 and was recruited by a Miami-area security company, CTU, to provide protection for an aspiring politician who wanted to replace Moïse as Haiti’s president.\n\nGoldbarg said Palacios was recruited along with more than 20 former Colombian soldiers by CTU and met with its president Antonio Intriago in Haiti in the weeks before the assassination plot was carried out. Intriago, who is being held at a federal lockup, has pleaded not guilty to the conspiracy and other charges in the high-profile case.\n\nGoldbarg said that initially Palacios understood that the goal was to capture Haiti’s president and arrest him. Palacios and the other Colombians conducted training sessions while CTU provided them with security equipment, including armored vests.\nPalacios was led in the mission by a retired Colombian army officer, Germán {Alejandro Rivera Garcia, aka “Colonel Mike,” who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges }and was sentenced to life in prison this fall.\n\nGoldbarg described Palacios as a “line security soldier” who took orders from Rivera and other Colombian commando leaders, noting that Palacios “did not have the authority to make decisions nor did he take part in planning of any operation.”\n\nCiting the factual statement, she said the day before the assassination, Palacios “was informed that the Colombian contractors would be conducting an operation at the presidential residence. Before the beginning of the operation, the defendant was also told that the president was going to die.”\nShe said the Colombian commandos took money and jewelry from the president’s home, and that Palacios kept some of the cash and jewels.\n\nIn the aftermath of the assault, three Colombians died during a shootout with Haitian national police outside the president’s residence.\n\nAt Friday’s hearing, Martinez, the judge, asked Palacios if the facts read by the prosecutor were true.\n“Yes, your honor,” he said.\n\nAfter the hearing, his defense attorney, Alfredo Izaguirre, stressed to reporters that Palacios had a minor role in the operation — though he was at the president’s residence during the deadly assault. Had Palacios not been informed of the plot to kill the president just before the raid, he added, “we’d probably be going to trial” instead of cutting a plea deal.\n\nIzaguirre said he plans to ask the judge to give Palacios less than a life sentence.\n\n“He wasn’t part of the plan” to kill Moïse, he said. “When he left Colombia, he didn’t know what he was going to get into.”\n\nThe U.S. government’s prosecution of the 11 original defendants has moved quickly with successive plea deals and sentencings.\n\nThis week, a former senator in Haiti’s parliament was sentenced to life in prison after he had previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill his country’s leader — but at a court hearing the ex-politician told a federal judge that his intention was only to arrest Moïse, not assassinate him. The former senator, Joseph Joël John, 52, who also is known as John Joël Joseph to his countrymen, was the third defendant to be given the maximum sentence by Martinez in the Haiti assassination case.\nJohn was also present at meetings in Haiti where the operation to kill the country’s leader was discussed, including one gathering at the home of a Haitian businessman the day before the assassination. Among those attending that critical meeting: Rodolphe Jaar, who hosted the gathering; Rivera, the Colombian commando leader; James Solages, a Haitian American; Joseph Vincent, a Haitian American who previously worked as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration; and Palacios, the ex-Colombian soldier.\n\nEarlier this month, Vincent, 58, pleaded guilty to the murder conspiracy and related charges and now faces life in prison.\n\nRivera, 45, aka “Colonel Mike,” admitted that he met with several co-conspirators from Haiti and South Florida before leading a group of former Colombian soldiers to the Haitian president’s home to kill him. He was sentenced in October to life in prison.\nJaar, 51, admitted to providing weapons, lodging and money in the conspiracy to assassinate Haiti’s president. A dual Haitian and Chilean citizen, Jaar was sentenced in June to life in prison. Previously, he was also convicted of drug trafficking in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, the Haiti national police have continued a parallel probe, which has resulted in the arrests of about 40 suspects — but no one has been formally charged in Haiti with the president’s assassination. According to sources familiar with Haiti’s probe, investigators are particularly interested in Palacios because he spent more than two months hiding in Haiti after Moïse’s death, before he fled to Jamaica.\n\nHaiti investigators, frustrated by the lack of assistance from the FBI, have had no access to Palacios since he surrendered to U.S. authorities. He was part of the first group of deployed Colombian commandos tasked with accessing the president’s bedroom on the night of the assault.\n\nHaiti authorities have expressed a keen interest in finding out who helped Palacios hide in Haiti and travel to Jamaica. To get there, Palacios had to go through gang-controlled territory at the southern edge of Port-au-Prince to the southern region of Haiti, where he then took a boat to Jamaica along a well-known drug trafficking route.",

        "articleBody": "Merry Christmas, Inter Miami fans.\n\nThe FC Barcelona Fab Four Reunion is complete. As expected, Inter Miami announced on Friday the long-awaited signing of Uruguayan star forward Luis Suarez, a former Barcelona teammate and close friend of Lionel Messi’s who also played alongside Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba at the Spanish club.\n\nSuarez, who turns 37 in January, is one of the world’s most prolific scorers with more than 500 goals for club and country during his career. \nHe signed a one-year deal for the 2024 Inter Miami season, which kicks off Feb. 21 at home against Real Salt Lake. Suarez was in Miami this week to finalize the deal and will now go on vacation with his wife, Sofia Balbi, and their three children.\n\n“I’m very happy and excited to take on this new challenge with Inter Miami,” Suarez said in a club-released statement. “I can’t wait to get started, and I’m ready to work to make the dream of winning more titles with this great Club a reality. I’m optimistic about what we can achieve together with our shared ambition. I will give my all to bring joy to these great fans I’ve heard so much about while I wear Inter Miami colors, and look forward to reuniting with great friends and players. I’m also eager to meet my new teammates and coaches.”\nIn addition to getting the opportunity to once again play with Messi, Busquets and Alba, Suarez reportedly was motivated to move to Inter Miami because the 2024 Copa America will be held in the United States over the summer, and it may be the final major tournament Suarez plays for Uruguay. Playing in MLS will get him acclimated to the country and several of the stadiums that will serve as tournament venues.\n\nIt remains to be determined whether he will occupy one of the club’s three allowed Designated Player spots or whether the team will use Targeted Allocation Money (TAM) to keep his salary below the DP threshold.\n\nHe joins Miami after a memorable season with Brazilian club Gremio. Although he was battling chronic knee issues, Suarez played a total of 52 games and 4,557 minutes this season. He scored 15 goals in 32 league games for Gremio and contributed 24 goals and 17 assists this year during all competitions. He was named Best Player and Best Striker in the Brazilian league and led Grêmio to win the Campeonato Gaúcho and Recopa Gaúcha. \n\nUruguayan forward Luis Suarez, who scored 15 goals in 32 league games for Brazilian club Gremio this season, signed with Inter Miami and will reunite with former FC Barcelona teammate and close friend Lionel Messi, as well as Barca teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. Inter Miami CF  \n\nHe received an emotional farewell ceremony from Gremio fans after his final game a few weeks ago. His off-field impact was massive.\n\nGremio’s club membership (season tickets) spiked from 60,000 at the start of the season to more than 100,000. Merchandise sales also got a huge boost.\n\n“We are happy to welcome world class striker Luis Suarez to our club,” said Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas. “Luis is a fierce competitor whose winning drive embodies what we want out of our players. We promised our fans we would pursue the world’s best players to build a squad that can compete at the highest echelons in the America’s. Coming off an award-winning season in Brazil, Luis will be a key addition to our roster. We will continue to be ambitious and always strive to pursue the Freedom to Dream.\n\nCo-owner David Beckham added: “We are delighted to have a player of Luis’ quality and passion for the game join our Club. He joins a squad that is inspiring the next generation and we look forward to seeing him take to the field with both former teammates and young players from our Academy.”\n\nSuarez, one of the sport’s most clinical finishers, is nicknamed “El Pistolero” (The Gunman) for his signature goal celebration. He points both index fingers and pretends to fire two pistols. He also has made international headlines after being banned three times for biting opponents during matches. The last time was during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, when Suarez bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in a four-month suspension by FIFA.\n\nSuarez joined Gremio in 2023 on a two-year deal, but once Messi signed with Miami in July, rumors intensified that Suarez would leave Brazil and join Messi. He negotiated a deal with Gremio to let him out of his contract a year early.\n\nSuarez and Messi played at Barcelona together from 2014 to 2020 and formed one of the most dangerous duos in recent memory. He scored 198 goals in six seasons for the Spanish team and became close friends with Messi. Their families also forged a bond.\n\nAlong with Alba and Busquets they won the UEFA Champions League and Club World Cup in 2015 and won four league titles. Before joining Barcelona, Suarez had won the European Golden Shoe with Liverpool.\nHe also has been one of the most important players in Uruguay’s rich soccer history. He led Uruguay to the World Cup semifinals in 2010 and a year later helped Uruguay win its 15th Copa America title and was named the tournament’s top player.\n\n“Luis is an outstanding striker with a track record of excellence at the very top levels of the sport. He has proven himself to be a singular talent in every league he’s played in over the course of his career thus far,” said Inter Miami sporting director Chris Henderson. “We’re looking to build on the successes of last season in 2024 and think Luis will be an important addition for us as we prepare to compete in several top competitions.”\n\nHe joins an Inter Miami team that had a sensational summer, going on a 12-game unbeaten streak to win the inaugural Leagues Cup, but Messi and Alba got injured and the team faltered late and failed to make the MLS playoffs.\n\nMLS training camp opens Jan. 10. Inter Miami has six preseason games scheduled, five of them out of the country. The team will play against El Salvador’s national team in San Salvador Jan. 19. It will travel to Saudi Arabia in late-January to face Al-Hilal Jan. 29 and Al-Nassr (against Cristiano Ronaldo) Feb. 1 in the Riyadh Season Cup.\n\nThen, it’s off to Hong Kong for a Feb. 4 game against an all-star team from the Hong Kong league, followed by a Feb. 7 game in Tokyo against Vissel Kobe. The one home preseason game so far is Feb. 15 against Newell’s Old Boys, the hometown team of Messi and Inter Miami coach Tata Martino.\n\nTicket information for the MLS games and the Newell’s preseason game is available on the club website intermiamicf.com",

The man's body had been wrapped in heavy tire chains and anchored to the bottom of the lake with a hydraulic jack.\n\nInvestigators at the time were unable to identify the man using investigative techniques and profiling methods available to them at the time. Then, in 2016, the victim's body was exhumed in the hopes that further investigation combined with an advancement in DNA technology and identification techniques could help give the man a name.\n\nDespite extensive efforts using the DNA technology available at the time along with dental examinations, forensic pathology and other advanced forensic testing, the man remained nameless. A profile was created for the John Doe on the National Missing and Unidentified Person System.\n\nMore details were provided, including the fact he was measured at 6ft 3ins and weighed an estimated 225lbs with brown hair and eyes. The body found floating in the lake was wearing a white 'No Fear' t-shirt, a nylon Dallas Cowboys jacket, a light green nylon Reebok jacket, blue jeans, a black leather belt and white socks.\n\nHe was also found with an XL maroon sport shirt and towels \"all wrapped around [the] neck\". He had gold crowns and a permanent bridge and was wearing size 10 and-a-half-wide Voit tennis shoes.\n\nBut then in early 2023, Kentucky State Police began working with Othram Inc., a private forensic lab specialising in forensic genealogy. Through advanced genealogy DNA testing of the remains, a relative of the unidentified man was discovered.\n\nEventually, police were able to name the man found at the bottom of the lake as Roger Dale Parham. But as investigators began to dig deeper into who the man at the bottom of the lake really was, some shocking revelations came to light. \n\nParham was living in Fort Smith, Arkansas, in 1999. At the time, he was waiting trial on various criminal charges having been arrested in late 1998 on a charge of rape involving a minor and released on bond.\n\nThe 52-year-old labourer, who often preferred to be paid in cash, was known to be a charming odd-job man with an interest in antiques. But soon, he was gone, \"thought to have left the area to flee prosecution\", according to police.\n\nThe state court issued a warrant for Parham's arrest, and he was later charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. As the early stages of the manhunt unfolded, another investigation was getting underway, two states away, on a lake known for its wildlife, boating and hiking trails.\n\nThe body found in Lake Barkley was almost certainly never meant to be found, having been wrapped in \"heavy tire chains\" and \"anchored with a hydraulic jack\". So as police in the Kentucky area tried to determine the identity of their drowned John Doe, law enforcement in Arkansas kept hunting for Roger Dale Parham.\n\nAlmost 25 years later, both mysteries have finally been solved. However, Parham's cause of death remains unknown. Given the \"suspicious circumstances in which the remains were located\" his death is \"being investigated as a homicide\".",

His daughter Scout shared a video to Instagram last month as she spent quality time with her dad - showing them holding hands at a table.\n\nHis family announced last March that he had to step away from acting and earlier this year, they confirmed a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. As the family celebrated Thanksgiving together, Bruce's wife Emma Heming Willis shared a throwback photo of the whole family, including her and Bruce's daughters Mabel and Evelyn, and his ex-wife Demi Moore and their daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah. \n\nExpressing her gratitude for her blended family, she wrote: \"I'm grateful and thankful to know this kind of love.\" After revealing that Bruce had been diagnosed with language disorder aphasia in March 2022, the family confirmed in February that he had progressed to a frontotemporal dementia diagnosis. The disease has a typical life expectancy of between six and eight years, but can be as low as two years in some cases.\n\nThe US star is now largely unable to communicate, according to Glenn Gordon Caron, who created Bruce's 1980's ABC series, Moonlighting. He kept in contact with the star and his ex-wife, along with their three children. Caron told the Post that Bruce \"now sees life through a screen door.\"\n\nHowever he believes Bruce can still recognise him in the first couple of minutes of meeting and says that deep down, he is still the man everyone knows and loves. \"He's not totally verbal; he used to be a voracious reader - he didn't want anyone to know that - and he's not reading now,\" he added. \"All those language skills are no longer available to him, and yet he's still Bruce... you're grateful that he's there, but the joie de vivre is gone.\"\n\nA source close to the family claimed that Emma, 45, Demi, 61, Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29, have been spending as much time as possible by his side alongside the younger girls Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, nine. They told US Weekly: \"Bruce has good days and bad days, but in the last two months, there are many more bad days than good.\n\n\"This experience has brought the whole family even closer together. No one knows how much time Bruce has left, so they're soaking up every moment they get with him. Bruce has around-the-clock care, but at least one family member is always with him.\"\n\nA further source then confirmed that the whole family is so determined to be with Bruce as much as possible that they are pretty much living together. They said: \"They’re all there all the time. Once Bruce was diagnosed, everyone came together to keep his memory of the family intact and to be there as a constant reminder they love him. Everything revolves around him.\"\n\nMeanwhile Rumer, who has always had a very close personal relationship with her father, reportedly brings her eight-month-old daughter Louetta to spend time with Bruce. The second source revealed: \"Rumer wants to make sure Louetta knows Bruce. She wants him to be actively involved in Louetta’s life. It’s a very special bond.\n\n\"Rumer and her sisters love their dad so much. They are very conscious that any day could be his last.” On Father’s Day, Rumer shared a photo of Bruce holding Louetta to her Instagram account saying: \"Papa I’m so lucky to have you and so is Lou.\"",

        "articleBody": "Jordan Montgomery is now a free agent. MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding the left-handed starting pitcher.\n\nFeb. 8: Montgomery 'most likely' will sign by next week\nThe free agent market has been moving slowly this offseason, but according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand and Jon Paul Morosi, we may have some action soon, particularly with one of the top starting pitchers remaining.\n\nFeinsand writes that \"the [free agent] that seems most likely [to sign] by next week is Montgomery.\" Morosi added that he believes Montgomery will sign by next Thursday, when each club's pitchers and catchers have reported for Spring Training. Both feel that the most likely destination for the star left-hander is back in Texas, where he helped the Rangers win their first World Series title last fall.\n\nJan. 11: Red Sox, Giants among clubs reportedly vying for Montgomery\nThursday brought significant news on three of the most high-profile starting pitchers in free agency: Shota Imanaga officially signed with the Cubs, and the Yankees reportedly made a contract offer to Blake Snell before agreeing to terms with Marcus Stroman.\n\nConversely, there hasn't been much buzz surrounding Montgomery as of late. But on Thursday, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman mentioned five teams that are interested in the left-hander.\n\nThe list includes the Red Sox, Giants, Phillies, Angels and Yankees, and Heyman writes that others are also involved. It's unclear if the Yankees remain interested in Montgomery after adding Stroman, but it's also unclear if Montgomery would seriously consider a return to the Bronx. Even before the Stroman signing, the Yankees were \"starting to believe Montgomery prefers to return to Texas or go somewhere else\" rather than play in pinstripes again, per Heyman.\n\nMontgomery spent his first five MLB seasons with the Bronx Bombers before being traded to St. Louis prior to the 2022 Trade Deadline. In July, the Cardinals shipped Montgomery to the Rangers, for whom he was a postseason hero during the club's run to its first World Series title.\n\nThe Rangers have been linked to Montgomery frequently this offseason, and Heyman described them last week as \"the most likely team\" to get the 31-year-old southpaw.",

        "articleBody": "Just for a night, the Los Angeles Rams' home of SoFi Stadium became ShoFi. \n\nYou already know all about Shohei Ohtani being a two-way superstar. But bear with us and just imagine -- for a brief, magical moment -- the possibility of Ohtani as a two-sport superstar. \n\nNever going to happen, of course, but there was a glimpse of what Ohtani might look like on the gridiron when he was given the Hollywood treatment before the Rams' Thursday Night Football game against the Saints. The new Dodgers star got to roam the sidelines and was gifted a No. 17 blue-and-gold jersey, a week after trying on the blue and white for the first time.\n\nOhtani -- who was greeted by Rams players and their mascot, Rampage -- was also spotted on the sidelines with a football in hand, trying to find the right grip on the laces. Not exactly the same as the grip on his wicked sweeper, but Ohtani seemed to be picking it up quickly, with what looked like a few pointers from his agent, Nez Balelo.\n\nUnfortunately there's no footage of Ohtani actually taking a shot at throwing the football, but we can only imagine how far he can chuck it. Certainly Rams QB Matthew Stafford -- a childhood friend and teammate of Dodgers great Clayton Kershaw -- would be thrilled to give Ohtani a tutorial.\n\nAfter the pregame festivities, Ohtani headed up to a suite to take in the game and was shown on the broadcast wearing the new Rams jersey underneath his suave leather jacket.\n\n\"How excited is Los Angeles to have him?\" color analyst Kirk Herbstreit said. \"He's been in Anaheim, and now he's a Dodger.\"\n\n\"Well they are more excited if you're a Dodger fan than if you're an Angel fan,\" play-by-play man Al Michaels quipped. \n\nThe excitement only built for Dodgers fans later in the night, when the team agreed to a massive deal for Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a teammate of Ohtani's on the 2023 World Baseball Classic championship team. The Rams are clearly ready to welcome Yamamoto to SoFi next, tweeting out a video of a jersey with his name on it hanging from the uprights.\n\n\nThe Shohei starpower in the house may have been a good luck charm for the Rams, who beat the Saints, 30-22, and then welcomed Ohtani into the locker room after the game. He had some words with head coach Sean McVay and shook hands with Stafford, who threw for over 300 yards on the night. So how about that passing lesson?",

The Eastern Conference club won their first-ever Supporters’ Shield, completing their turnaround from three straight last-place finishes (2019-21) upon joining MLS to being the league’s top regular-season team.\n\nUnder Noonan’s direction, Cincy tied for the fourth-most points (69) in a single MLS season and carved out a 13W-2L-2D home record at TQL Stadium. They also became just the ninth team in league history to win at least 20 games in a single season (excluding the shootout era).\n\nFC Cincinnati excelled during close games in 2023, leading MLS with 14 wins in one-goal games – the third-highest single-season total in league history. Additionally, they closed matches better than any other team in MLS this season, capturing the most points after the 75th minute (12) while being the only team not to drop any points after the 75th minute.\n\nThe 2023 MLS Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year award honors the best head coach in MLS during the 2023 regular season.\n\nThe award was voted on by MLS club technical staff, media and current MLS players.

        "title": "Who Can Best Manage Your Investments?",
        "authors": "Sheryl Rowling",
        "date": "2023-11-27",
        "articleBody": "Using an advisor can help investors avoid trying to time the market.\n\nIndividual investors manage their accounts differently from institutional and advisor-managed investors. To quantify that difference, Morningstar recently released its annual Mind the Gap study, which examined actual returns earned by investors versus returns of funds. In this article, we’ll look at the statistics, what they mean, and how investors optimize their results.\n\nThe Mind the Gap Study\n\nAccording to the study, “investors earned about 6% per year on the average dollar they invested in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2022. This is about 1.7 percentage points less than the total returns their fund investments generated over the same period. This shortfall, or gap, stems from poorly timed purchases and sales of fund shares, which cost investors roughly one fifth the return they would have earned if they had simply bought and held.”\n\nIn other words, when individual investors move in and out of the market, they end up hurting their returns.\n\nTo put this shortfall in perspective, let’s say an investor started with $100,000 as of Jan. 1, 2013. Earning an average annual return of 7.7% would result in a total of about $210,000 after 10 years. By lowering the return to 6%, the total drops to approximately $179,000. The reduction of 1.7% per year reduced the investment balance by more than $30,000 after 10 years.\n\nThe recent study showed that the 1.7% gap is consistent with previous rolling 10-year results. It should also be noted that gaps vary according to type of fund. Funds with smaller gaps include U.S. equity funds, taxable-bond funds, and asset-allocation funds. Funds with wider return gaps include sector and nontraditional equity funds.\n\nThe bottom line is that buying and holding funds will generally produce higher returns than attempting to time the market. In fact, the authors recommend that investors use asset-allocation funds and hold them for the long term. Based on this study, would simply buying and holding asset-allocation funds make more sense than using an advisor?\n\nValue of an Advisor\n\nIn a recent article by Vanguard, “Putting a Value on Your Value: Quantifying Vanguard Advisor’s Alpha,” the value of “behavioral coaching” by advisors added as much as 200 basis points (or 2%) per year. This figure is similar to the 1.7% gap in the Morningstar study!\n\nWhether 1.7% or 2%, if this was the only value provided by advisors, then an investor with resolve to stay the course would not benefit from an advisor. However, according to the Vanguard analysis, advisors can add up to 2% or more in net returns from other factors:\n\n    Low-Cost Funds: 30 basis points\n    Rebalancing: 35 basis points\n    Asset Location: Up to 75 basis points\n    Spending Strategy: Up to 120 basis points\n\nIn “An Empirical Evaluation of Tax-Loss-Harvesting Alpha (Summary),” the CFA Institute determined the benefit after costs from ongoing tax-loss harvesting was 69 basis points annually.\n\nThus, if we add in the value of tax-loss harvesting, the advisor benefit—without behavioral coaching—can potentially be 2.7% or more per year. Even with an average fee of 1%, clients who think they don’t need coaching would benefit by about 1.7% per year by using a tax-aware advisor.\n\nWhat Investors Should Do\n\nIn a perfect world, investors would not react emotionally to market events; they would stay invested and stick to their strategies. In reality, individual investors fall short. According to Morningstar, they fall short by 1.7% per year. To counteract the tendency to stray, investors can use advisors.\n\nBut an advisor’s value cannot be measured solely by the behavioral coaching component. Advisors also add value through other means such as rebalancing, spending strategies, and tax savings. Thus, to avoid a performance gap and to take advantage of other benefits, investors should consider using highly qualified advisors.\n\nNote that all advisors are not alike. A fee-only advisor will put the clients’ interests first (as fiduciary registered investment advisors) and not sell products. From there, investors should evaluate advisors based on the 4 C’s:\n\n    Competence: Experience, education, and reputation\n    Compensation: Fee-only\n    Credentials: Such as a certified financial planner or a certified public accountant/personal financial specialist.\n    Comfort: Comfort in sharing your financial and personal information as well as feeling like your advisor really listens to you\n\nSummary\n\n    Investors should not attempt to time the market.\n    Holding diversified, low-cost investments is key to maximizing long-term returns.\n    Using an advisor can help avoid trying to time the market.\n    A tax-savvy advisor can add value above and beyond annual fees.",

        "title": "Why We Expect Inflation to Fall in 2024",
        "authors": "Preston Caldwell",
        "date": "2023-01-29",
        "articleBody": "For now, it looks like inflation will return to normal without a recession.\n\nAs we had expected, inflation fell sharply in 2023 after reaching its highest level in over 40 years in 2022. In 2024, we project inflation to return to normal levels, in line with the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target.\n\nIn our latest Economic Outlook, we detail that the drop in inflation has been driven principally by the unwinding of price spikes owing to supply chain resolutions and by the slowing pace of economic growth because of the Fed’s tightening.\n\nWe expect inflation to average 1.8% from 2024 to 2028—falling just under the Fed’s 2.0% inflation target.\n\nIf inflation proves stickier than expected, the Fed stands ready to do whatever’s necessary—including inducing a recession—to bring inflation down to 2%. But our base case is a soft landing, with inflation returning to normal despite only a modest and temporary deceleration in gross domestic product growth.\n\nHeadline Inflation Has Plunged Since Mid-2022\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE Index, which is our (and the Fed’s) preferred inflation measure, fell from a peak of 7.1% year-over-year growth in June 2022 to just 2.6% as of December 2023.\n\nConsumer Price Index inflation, which has some methodological differences with PCE, has fallen even more dramatically year over year. It had peaked at a higher rate (8.9%) owing to a higher weighting in energy. CPI inflation was 3.3% year over year in December 2023.\n\nCore inflation has also been on a gradual downtrend since early 2022, though its decline is less impressive compared with headline inflation. Because core inflation strips out the impact of volatile food and energy prices, economists often use it as a cleaner measure of inflation’s underlying trend. Core PCE inflation was 2.9% year over year in December 2023, slightly higher than the overall inflation rate. Core CPI inflation is running a bit higher at 3.9% year over year, owing to a higher weighting in housing.\n\nCategories That Have Played an Outsize Role in Excess Inflation\n\nThe postpandemic jump in inflation began with only a handful of spending categories.\n\nExcess inflation (the difference between cumulative inflation versus its prepandemic average) was only 5.7 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022. At that time, durable goods, energy, and food at home accounted for nearly 70% of that excess inflation, despite being only 20% of total consumption.\n\nSince then, inflation has spread to several other categories. These other categories, which include housing, vehicles, and more, now account for about half of excess inflation. Still, the partial deflation in these categories has helped slow the overall inflation rate substantially. And, we see the inflation in these categories as more of a one-time catch-up effect.\n\nWhere We Expect Inflation to Fall the Most Over 2024-28\n\nGiven the role of industry-specific supply shocks in driving historically high inflation, we take a bottom-up approach to forecasting inflation for the next five years. That is, we start by examining the underlying components and work toward macro trends.\n\nHere’s where we expect the greatest drop in inflation (and sometimes outright deflation) between 2024 and 2028:\n\n    Durables: Major supply constraints are lifting. In particular, the semiconductor market is likely to flip from shortage to glut over the next few years. The normalization of spending patterns (shifting back to services) is also easing pricing pressure on goods. We expect about one third of the excess inflation in durables to unwind by 2027.\n    Food and energy: We expect prices to subside as the industry adjusts to disruption from factors such as the Ukraine war, and one-off events such as the outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in 2022, which especially elevated egg and poultry prices.\n    Housing: Housing inflation has accelerated markedly over the past year, but we don’t expect this to last. Assuming market rent growth doesn’t reaccelerate, it’s inevitable that housing inflation will fall back to normal.\n\nIn all other components of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, we expect moderate wage growth and the absence of any long-lasting supply disruptions to keep inflation at restrained levels. And the economy growing well below potential through 2024 will cause widespread deflationary pressure.\n\nSupply Chain Healing Will Bring Goods Prices Down\n\nNumerous production and logistical disruptions have contributed to inflation in durables and other parts of the economy. But supply chains are healing as demand normalizes and capacity catches up: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index is showing supply chain conditions about in line with prepandemic levels.\n\nThere’s more help on the way. One indicator on the logistics side is that there are enough container ships set to be delivered over the next several years to expand the current fleet by 30%. And manufacturing capacity is expanding in the United States and other major economies, such as China.\n\nOther key takeaways about supply chains include:\n\n    Supply chain improvement won’t be fully reflected in lower prices right away, just as core goods prices didn’t peak until about a year after supply chain paralysis set in.\n    Producer prices for transport have fallen compared with a year ago, as have import prices.\n    Elevated retailers’ gross margins are still propping up high consumer prices.\n\nHousing Market Inflation in 2024 and Beyond\n\nBecause price indexes capture the cost of living, and most people don’t sign a new lease or buy a new house every year, it takes time for housing prices in price indexes to capture changing market conditions. For this reason, CPI inflation is still running fairly hot owing to the accumulated runup in market rents since 2021.\n\nThat said, here’s where the housing market currently stands:\n\n    Market rents are now decelerating sharply in response to falling housing demand and expanding apartment supply. Rent growth fell to only about 2.8% year over year as of October 2023, from about 15.0% as of April 2022. This is causing CPI shelter to finally decelerate, which we expect to persist over the next year until housing inflation returns to normal.\n    We expect home prices to fall as weak home demand will continue to weigh on housing prices. After a 1.5% drop in 2024, we expect home prices to remain flat and eventually converge most of the way back to the prepandemic trend. This will return the CPI shelter index to normal.\n    Lower housing prices will also aid in returning housing affordability to more reasonable levels. From a cost perspective, lower home prices should become more palatable for builders as easing supply constraints reduce the cost of construction inputs.\n\nA Soft Landing Is Our Base Case for Inflation in 2024\n\nOur base case is that inflation will return to normal in 2024, even as real GDP growth remains positive in year-over-year terms—a “soft landing.”\n\nOver the past year, inflation has fallen around 300 basis points even as real GDP growth has accelerated. That performance has defied the predictions of those in the stagflation camp who thought that a deep economic slump would be needed to root out entrenched inflation. Instead, the inflation-GDP trade-off has been very kind, thanks to the loosening of supply constraints, as we had long anticipated.\n\nStill, we’ve been surprised by the resiliency of economic growth in the face of aggressive rate hikes from the Fed. This means the “overheating” scenario has increased in probability, where the economy grows at a rollicking pace and inflation remains in the 3%-4% range.\n\nWe still think that the Fed’s rate hikes executed thus far will eventually slow GDP growth sufficiently and that inflation will drop to 2% (while avoiding an outright recession). The effects of these rate hikes are still accumulating throughout the economy as borrowers roll over to higher interest rates and exhaust their financial cushions.",

        "title": "An Apollo 8 Christmas Dinner Surprise: Turkey and Gravy Make Space History",
        "authors": "Jennifer Ross-Nazzal",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "On Christmas Day in 1968, the three-man Apollo 8 crew of Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders found a surprise in their food locker: a specially packed Christmas dinner wrapped in foil and decorated with red and green ribbons. Something as simple as a “home-cooked meal,” or as close as NASA could get for a spaceflight at the time, greatly improved the crew’s morale and appetite. More importantly, the meal marked a turning point in space food history.\n\nOn their way to the Moon, the Apollo 8 crew was not very hungry. Food scientist Malcolm Smith later documented just how little the crew ate. Borman ate the least of the three, eating only 881 calories on day two, which concerned flight surgeon Chuck Berry. Most of the food, Borman later explained, was “unappetizing.” The crew ate few of the compressed, bite-sized items, and when they rehydrated their meals, the food took on the flavor of their wrappings instead of the actual food in the container. “If that doesn’t sound like a rousing endorsement, it isn’t,” he told viewers watching the Apollo 8 crew in space ahead of their surprise meal. As Anders demonstrated to the television audience how the astronauts prepared a meal and ate in space, Borman announced his wish, that folks back on Earth would “have better Christmas dinners” than the one the flight crew would be consuming that day.\n\nIf that doesn’t sound like a rousing endorsement, it isn’t.\n\nOver the 1960s, there were many complaints about the food from astronauts and others working at the Manned Spacecraft Center (now NASA’s Johnson Space Center). After evaluating the food that the Apollo 8 crew would be consuming onboard their upcoming flight, Apollo 9 astronaut Jim McDivitt penciled a note to the food lab about his in-flight preferences. Using the back of the Apollo 8 crew menu, he directed them to decrease the number of compressed bite-sized items “to a bare minimum” and to include more meat and potato items. “I get awfully hungry,” he wrote, “and I’m afraid I’m going to starve to death on that menu.”2\n\nIn 1969, Rita Rapp, a physiologist who led the Apollo Food System team, asked Donald Arabian, head of the Mission Evaluation Room, to evaluate a four-day food supply used for the Apollo missions. Arabian identified himself as someone who “would eat almost anything. … you might say [I am] somewhat of a human garbage can.” But even he found the food lacked the flavor, aroma, appearance, texture, and taste he was accustomed to. At the end of his four-day assessment he concluded that “the pleasures of eating were lost to the point where interest in eating was essentially curtailed.”\n\nApollo 8 commander Frank Borman concurred with Arabian’s assessment of the Apollo food. The one item Borman enjoyed? It was the contents of the Christmas meal wrapped in ribbons: turkey and gravy. The Christmas dinner was so delicious that the crew contacted Houston to inform them of their good fortune. “It appears that we did a great injustice to the food people,” Lovell told capsule communicator (CAPCOM) Mike Collins. “Just after our TV show, Santa Claus brought us a TV dinner each; it was delicious. Turkey and gravy, cranberry sauce, grape punch; [it was] outstanding.” In response, Collins expressed delight in hearing the good news but shared that the flight control team was not as lucky. Instead, they were “eating cold coffee and baloney sandwiches.”\n\nThe Apollo 8 meal was a “breakthrough.” Until that mission, the food choices for Apollo crews were limited to freeze dried foods that required water to be added before they could be consumed, and ready-to-eat compressed foods formed into cubes. Most space food was highly processed. On this mission NASA introduced the “wetpack”: a thermostabilized package of turkey and gravy that retained its normal water content and could be eaten with a spoon. Astronauts had consumed thermostabilized pureed food on the Project Mercury missions in the early 1960s, but never chunks of meat like turkey. For the Project Gemini and Apollo 7 spaceflights, astronauts used their fingers to pop bite-sized cubes of food into their mouths and zero-G feeder tubes to consume rehydrated food. The inclusion of the wetpack for the Apollo 8 crew was years in the making. The U.S. Army Natick Labs in Massachusetts developed the packaging, and the U.S. Air Force conducted numerous parabolic flights to test eating from the package with a spoon.\n\nSmith called the meal a real “morale booster.” He noted several reasons for its appeal: the new packaging allowed the astronauts to see and smell the turkey and gravy; the meat’s texture and flavor were not altered by adding water from the spacecraft or the rehydration process; and finally, the crew did not have to go through the process of adding water, kneading the package, and then waiting to consume their meal. Smith concluded that the Christmas dinner demonstrated “the importance of the methods of presentation and serving of food.” Eating from a spoon instead of the zero-G feeder improved the inflight feeding experience, mimicking the way people eat on Earth: using utensils, not squirting pureed food out of a pouch into their mouths. Using a spoon also simplified eating and meal preparation. NASA added more wetpacks onboard Apollo 9, and the crew experimented eating other foods, including a rehydrated meal item, with the spoon.\n\nood was one of the few creature comforts the crew had on the Apollo 8 flight, and this meal demonstrated the psychological importance of being able to smell, taste, and see the turkey prior to consuming their meal, something that was lacking in the first four days of the flight. Seeing appetizing food triggers hunger and encourages eating. In other words, if food looks and smells good, then it must taste good. Little things like this improvement to the Apollo Food System made a huge difference to the crews who simply wanted some of the same eating experiences in orbit and on the Moon that they enjoyed on Earth.",

        "articleBody": "A NASA technology experiment on the International Space Station completed its first laser link with an in-orbit laser relay system on Dec. 5, 2023. Together, they complete NASA’s first two-way, end-to-end laser relay system.\n\nNASA’s LCRD (Laser Communications Relay Demonstration) and the new space station demonstration, ILLUMA-T (Integrated LCRD Low Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal), successfully exchanged data for the first time. LCRD and ILLUMA-T are demonstrating how a user mission, in this case the space station, can benefit from a laser communications relay located in geosynchronous orbit.\n\nLaser communications, also known known as optical communications, uses infrared light rather than traditional radio waves to send and receive signals. The tighter wavelength of infrared light allows spacecraft to pack more data into each transmission. Using laser communications greatly increases the efficiency of data transfer and can lead to a faster pace of scientific discoveries.\n\nOn Nov. 9, NASA’s SpaceX 29th commercial resupply services mission launched cargo and new science experiments, including ILLUMA-T, to the space station. Following its arrival, the payload was installed onto the station’s Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility.\n\nILLUMA-T and LCRD are a part of the NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program’s effort to demonstrate how laser communications technologies can significantly benefit science and exploration missions.\n\n“ILLUMA-T’s first link with LCRD – known as first light – is the latest demonstration proving that laser communications is the future.” said Dr. Jason Mitchell, director of SCaN’s Advanced Communications and Navigation Technology division. “Laser communications will not only return more data from science missions, but could serve as NASA’s critical, two-way link to keep astronauts connected to Earth as they explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond.”\n\nShortly after space station installation, operation engineers began conducting on-orbit testing to ensure the ILLUMA-T payload operated nominally. Now, it is communicating with LCRD, a relay launched in 2021 that has conducted over 300 experiment configurations to help NASA refine laser communications technologies. LCRD and ILLUMA-T are exchanging data at 1.2 gigabits-per-second.\n\n“We have demonstrated that we can overcome the technical challenges for successful space communications using laser communications. We are now performing operational demonstrations and experiments that will allow us to optimize our infusion of proven technology into our missions to maximize our exploration and science,” said David Israel, a NASA space communications and navigation architect.\n\nThe LCRD experiments are conducted with industry, academia, and other government agencies. ILLUMA-T is now LCRD’s first in-space user experiment. NASA is still accepting experiments to work with LCRD. Interested parties should contact lcrd-experiments@nasa.onmicrosoft.com for more information.\n\nILLUMA-T is funded by NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The payload is managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Partners include the International Space Station program office at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts.",

        "title": "Stage 60 represents ‘targeted effort’ for RFK Racing’s growth, Daytona 500 hopes in 2024",
        "authors": "Zack Albert",
        "date": "2023-12-11",
        "articleBody": "Not long after the curtain closed on a resurgent season for RFK Racing, the organization provided a glimpse into the year ahead with expansion plans. The addition of a part-time third entry on the NASCAR Cup Series circuit is a new wrinkle, but the growth has its fingerprints on some significant nostalgia for the team that Hall of Famer Jack Roush started back in 1988.\n\nRFK outlined its plans for the “Stage 60” project during NASCAR Champion’s Week, tabbing veteran David Ragan for the No. 60 Ford in the season-opening Daytona 500 and indicating that additional 2024 races would be announced later. Ragan last competed full-time in the Cup Series in 2019 but has been a regular in Ford’s testing and development program.\n\nTeam co-owner Brad Keselowski said that the Stage 60 effort marks an initial step toward a more established third team in the future, one that he said he hopes to achieve through measured, thoughtful expansion. In the shorter term, the strength-in-numbers gain plus Ragan’s steady reputation at superspeedways boost RFK’s chances at Daytona, where Keselowski and teammate Chris Buescher excelled last season.\n\n“The principle behind it was, ‘hey, we want to get to a third car,’ but just going out, and even if you were to go buy a charter tomorrow and even if you were to sign the right partners tomorrow, you still would need to have people and have assets,” Keselowski said before the NASCAR Awards in Nashville. “And so we realized that we needed to kind of crawl, walk, and run our way to making that a successful venture. I think the premise behind Daytona is that’s probably one of the actually easier races for us to run, with respect to selling a partner, bringing in a good driver like David, and then the success that we’ve had with our cars at those tracks, we felt really confident that we could go there and be competitive.\n\n“Yeah, we want to have a third car for the 500. The last few years, we’ve been in position to win the race with both of our cars, and for a number of reasons it didn’t come together, and we’d like to think that having a third car would give us some more strength that we’d be able to bring that home. So, to be determined on what the result will be, but the intentions are really good, and the effort’s really good, and that’s what we can control.”\n\nStage 60 bears some resemblance to the advent of similar part-time entries in the Cup Series in recent years — most notably the Project 91 initiative by Trackhouse Racing and the No. 67 ride from the 23XI Racing shop. Those efforts have introduced stars from other walks of motorsports into NASCAR with a focus on superspeedway and road-course events.\n\nKeselowski suggested that a similar blueprint will likely take shape for starters at RFK’s No. 60 car, but he also indicated that the organization has explored IMSA “in the longer term” as a potential avenue for bolstering its road-course program on the Cup Series side.\n\n“I don’t think we’re thinking of it as an R&D effort,” Keselowski said of Stage 60. “We’re thinking of it as a really targeted effort to go out there and learn with new drivers and find new opportunities for new partners and new people within the organization. So I think we’re looking at it with kind of this fresher look of hopefully we’ll be able to sign a few more partners for some of the road-course events and the superspeedway events is really what we have targeted for this year. And if we’re able to do that, we’d like to bring some fresh faces into the sport.”\n\nThe No. 60 itself has a limited pedigree in the Cup Series, with only one long-ago victory by Bill Rexford during his run to the tour’s second-ever championship in 1950. But the number holds special meaning for RFK Racing as a benchmark for its years of success in what is now the NASCAR Xfinity Series.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2015, Roush-owned Fords with No. 60 scored an impressive 94 victories in the series, with luminaries such as Mark Martin, Carl Edwards, and Greg Biffle handling the driving duties. Among those contributing to the victory total is Buescher, who won three times with the number and drove a No. 60 Mustang to the 2015 Xfinity title.\n\nThe reintroduction of the No. 60 under the RFK banner holds sentimental value for Buescher, but so does a reunion with Ragan. Both drivers have been under the employ of Roush and Front Row Motorsports during their careers, but the connection runs all the way back to Buescher’s close ties with the Ragan family upon his move to the Charlotte area as a teenager.\n\n“I owe a tremendous amount of my being here — really simply put — to that entire family,” Buescher said, saying he moved in with them, completed home-schooling there, and working in the Ragan family’s racing shop when he wasn’t volunteering for pit-stop practice with Roush’s group.\n\nNow Buescher says he’s anticipating getting to work alongside Ragan again at Daytona, with the goal of replicating RFK Racing’s dominance there in last season’s regular-season finale — a 1-2 finish with Buescher edging out Keselowski for his third win of the year.\n\n“A lot of history there, a lot of connection, and cool to have a friend in another one of our race cars going to track,” said Buescher, who finished seventh in the Cup Series standings last year — one spot ahead of Keselowski. “It’s exciting because I know the potential we’ve had with our Mustangs at RFK when we come to any track, but superspeedway racing, just to fire off with Daytona, the success we’ve had there with two cars and what we’ve been able to do. We’ve certainly put the rest of the field on notice when it comes to those events that we’re going to be hard to beat, and you add a third competitive car in there with somebody like David, who is extremely smart and ready to go for superspeedway racing, it can certainly just up our chances and figure out how to get more RFK Fords in Victory Lane.”",

        "articleBody": "Season in review: Bubba Wallace, No. 23 23XI Racing Toyota\nCrew Chief: Robert “Bootie” Barker\nFinal 2023 Ranking: 10th\nKey stats: 0 wins, five top fives, 10 top 10s, 285 laps led\n\nHow 2023 ended: Statistically speaking, the 2023 season ended as the strongest in Wallace’s six-year, full-time career in NASCAR’s Cup Series. He qualified for the playoffs for the first time and scored four of his season’s 10 top-10 finishes during the playoff run — advancing to the second round of playoff competition.\n\nBest race: Although Wallace has made a name for himself with his showing on superspeedways, his 2023 season was highlighted by a third-place finish at the 1.5-mile Texas Motor Speedway in the September playoff race, where he led a race-best – and career single-race high — 111 laps.\n\nOther season highlights: Although Wallace did not score a victory this year, he still excelled on track, earning his maiden playoff berth, advancing to the second round, and setting a career-high mark in laps led (285). He was a bona fide contender from the season’s first green flag to its final checkered flag – leading laps and being as competitive at the end of races as at the start. Wallace credits his success this year to tempering his emotions and “keeping my head in the game,” recognizing that some days getting a top 10 with a top-10 car is still a success.\n\nStat to Know: One of the most significant indicators of Wallace’s strong season is that he nearly doubled his single season laps led total (285) compared to a previous best of 150 last year. He led laps in 12 races – a third of the season schedule.\n\nQuotable: “Definitely being talked about a lot more for our performances and race results, not so much in the negative headlines so that’s good and we’ve just got to continue to build on that. Definitely learned a lot about who I am as a driver and trying to be a better team leader and it’s all starting to click more and more. Just have to get the wick lit earlier in the season and get on a hot streak and keep that flame going.”\n\nLooking ahead: Earning his maiden playoff opportunity was a sign of Wallace’s arrival in the sport’s upper echelon. He doubled his laps led total, equaled career-best marks in top fives and top 10s and will be able to look back on the 2023 season as a real turning point. One of the categories Wallace would like to improve on is his stage win tally. He had zero this season despite earning the ninth-most stage points in the series. He’s won races in two of the last three seasons and in 2023 positioned himself to do so multiple times. Wallace should head into next season with confidence, looking to put all his achievements together – winning races, leading laps and taking top-10 finishes on a mediocre day to advance farther in the playoffs.",

At the time, she had already conceived six other children through IVF, making her a mother of 14.\n\nAlthough she previously scored a deal for a reality TV show in the United Kingdom, the star — who goes by the name Natalie Suleman on Instagram — has kept out of the public eye for the most part. However, she does share updates about her big brood every so often on social media.\n\nOn June 15, 2020, she posted several new photos of her kids smiling while spending time together in the kitchen. “Nariyah and Maliyah are slowly taking over as head chefs since they love to cook.”\n\nNoticably absent from the photo was her son Aidan. The star previously spoke out about his developmental disorder on Instagram, revealing that he is on the “Autism spectrum.” Nadya vowed to “never give up on him,” and discussed how she wanted to give him the best life possible.\n\nIn another heartfelt post on the platform, the Fullerton native expressed how grateful she was for the loyal following she’s gained over the past 12 years. Nadya also revealed at the time what she was hoping to accomplish in the year to come.\n\nI will try to share far more frequently with you all this year; and in addition, elucidate misconceptions from my past. 2020 marks the seventh year since escaping the false life I was leading; forging on, building a better life for my family,” she wrote in the caption.\n\nAfter seeing the latest pic of her kids, fans can’t believe how much they have grown up. Nadya previously gushed over what incredible people they are becoming while celebrating their first day of fifth grade back in August 2019.\n\nOn her 47th birthday in July 2022, Nadya showed just how caring her kids are. Not only did she celebrate with all 14 of her kids, but “a few of my youngest ‘chefs’ surprised me with a homemade vegan marble cake, donut balls and lasagna,” she revealed.\n\n“This is all that matters to me, family and the love we have for one another,” she added.\n\nWhen her octuplets turned 14 years old on January 26, 2023, Nadya and the kids celebrated at home with gold mylar birthday balloons and vegan donuts in place of a cake, as all eight teens are vegan. Despite the children weighing between 1 pound 8 ounces and 3 pounds 4 ounces when they were born, the kids are happy and healthy today.",

Despite her sincere apology, Orion took the statement very offensively and admitted he was a “little heated” about the conversation.\n\n“Growing up, you know, what came from my elders and my mom was just, ‘You don’t say that,’ you know?” he explained to his wife. “You just don’t do it because it minimizes who you are. And then, you know, making a joke out of the pain, I would say my cultural background has a very different approach.”\n\nOrion later asked Lauren during the November 22, 2023, episode about the last time she had sex, to which she honestly replied, “Two months probably to the day.”\n\nThe MAFS groom was visibly uncomfortable before admitting the revelation “took sex off the table” for him.\n\nThe conversation would lead to a bigger argument, where Orion admitted he lost all romantic attraction for Lauren and asked for a divorce.\n\nDoes Michael Get Remarried After ‘Runaway Bride’?\n\nFor  the first time in 17 seasons, fans watched as Michael’s bride decided not to get married after meeting him for the first time at the altar.\n\nAs his bride walked down the aisle, she was only seen from behind, with the cameras hiding her identity. “I see her. She’s extremely beautiful,” the senior project manager said as he laid eyes on her.\n\nHowever, after making their first introductions, the never-identified woman says, “I don’t think I can do this,” before the ceremony abruptly ends in everyone’s shock.\n\nWhile his runaway bride’s identity was never shown onscreen, In Touch confirmed that Micheal married Chloe Brown in March 2023, nearly six weeks after the original four MAFS Denver couples were married in late January.\n\nMichael was speculated to have been matched by the MAFS experts to a woman named Chloe; however, it was initially unclear if she was the “runaway bride.”\n\nChloe made her debut during the January 10, 2024, episode and revealed why she signed up for the unusual way of finding love.\n\n“If you asked me in my early 20s what I wanted in a man, what I wanted then and what I want now are two completely different things,” the new bride explained. “I have an opportunity to do something I’ve never imagined in my life doing ever, really thinking about being married at first sight!”",

Click here to create your own NBA ID and download the NBA App to see all the exclusive member benefits and exciting rewards coming throughout the season!\n\nHere are some exhilarating matchups that fans can watch for free through Saturday’s promotion:\n\nMilwaukee Bucks vs. New York Knicks\n\nCatch this preview of a Christmas Day matchup as Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks travel to the Big Apple to face the Knicks.\n\n“The Greek Freak” has been on a tear lately, averaging 36.6 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game in his last 10 games. This stretch also included a career-high game against the Indianapolis Pacers in which Antetokounmpo scored 64 points.\n\nMeanwhile, New York’s duo of Julius Randle and Jalen Brunson are averaging 27+ points per game each in their last 10 games. During this stretch, the Knicks hold a 6-4 record.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves vs. Sacramento Kings\n\nThe Timberwolves have been red-hot this season. Minnesota currently holds the No. 1 seed in the West with a 21-6 record. Anthony Edwards is trending toward superstardom, but the defensive turnaround deserves the most credit.\n\nMinnesota holds a 107.6 defensive rating, the best in the league. They are also the only team that ranks in the top 5 in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint (3rd) and opponent effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (2nd).\n\nDe’Aaron Fox has the potential to cause the defense some problems. The 2022-23 Kia NBA Clutch Player of the Year is one of six players averaging 30+ points or more. Fox has led the Kings to a 16-10 record this season.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nShai Gilgeous Alexander has taken the Thunder to new heights this season, bringing them within reach of the franchise’s first playoff appearance since 2019-20. The defense, led by Chet Holmgren (2.7 blocks per game) and Gilgeous-Alexander (NBA-leading 2.8 steals per game), has propelled the team to a stellar defensive rating of 110.2, ranking third-best in the league.\n\nIt’s been a different story in Hollywood. The Lakers have struggled since winning the 2023 In-Season Tournament with a 1-5 record. Yet, with LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the charge, you can never quite count this team out.\n\nThe big man has been unleashed, averaging 29.8 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks in his last 10 games. An intriguing matchup with one of the league’s best rim protectors awaits.",

        "articleBody": "Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman tracks which players are rising and falling the most in his latest mock draft for 2024.\n\n(B/R) — The top of 2024 NBA draft boards are fuzzier than any in recent memory heading into the holiday break.\n\nThere still isn’t a true No. 1 overall favorite, which means the lottery order and team needs could play a bigger role in who goes first than usual. Right now, our projected first pick could change each mock draft depending on the NBA standings and odds.\n\nWhile several top NCAA prospects have underwhelmed early, the top names overseas have exceeded expectations. At this current rate, three of the top five picks may be international.\n\nThe upcoming draft may be receiving some needed boosts from surprise college freshmen and breakout upperclassmen. But unless one of the high-profile prospects starts to separate from the pack, there could be a lot of trade chatter at No. 1 after the lottery.\n\nDraft order based on standings heading into Wednesday’s games.\n\nBiggest Risers and Fallers Since Last Mock Draft\n\nRisers\n\nReed Sheppard, Kentucky\nRob Dillingham, Kentucky\nTrevon Brazile, Arkansas\nAjay Mitchell, Santa Barbara\nDalton Knecht, Tennessee\nTerrence Shannon Jr., Illinois\n\nFallers\n\nTyrese Proctor, Duke\nJustin Edwards, Kentucky\nAday Mara, UCLA\nCarlton Carrington, Pittsburgh\nAaron Bradshaw, Kentucky\n\nBiggest Risers and Fallers This Season\n\nRisers\n\nNikola Topic, Mega MIS\nCarlton Carrington, Pittsburgh\nReed Sheppard, Kentucky\nRyan Dunn, Virginia\nHunter Sallis, Wake Forest\nKevin McCullar Jr., Kansas\nDalton Knecht, Tennessee\nAjay Mitchell, Santa Barbara\n\nFallers\n\nAaron Bradshaw, Kentucky\nJustin Edwards, Kentucky\nD.J. Wagner, Kentucky\nMark Mitchell, Duke\n\n1. Detroit Pistons: Alexandre Sarr\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 4\n    School/Team: Perth Wildcats\n    Position: PF/C\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 7-foot-1, 216 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\nAlexandre Sarr’s flashes at both ends have created visions of a 7-foot-1 power forward/center who’s a switchable rim protector and 3-point threat, capable of driving past closeouts and scoring with touch around the key.\n\nAnd for an 18-year-old, those visions give Sarr some wiggle room with his consistency and polish. Reminders of his lack of strength, shooting reliability and handle are served regularly. But scouts will be patient due to his coveted archetype and his NBL production as a teenager.\n\nHe’s making an impact at his absolute floor with play-finishing, occasional shotmaking and defensive contests. There may be a wide variety of potential outcomes when dealing with Sarr’s trajectory, but there is top-player-in-the-class upside if a best-case scenario plays out with his development, while Sarr still figures to improve a rotation if he winds up plateauing as an athletic two-way energizer.\n\n2. San Antonio Spurs: Nikola Topic\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 2\n    School/Team: Mega MIS\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 198 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\nPotentially the youngest 2024 draft prospect, Nikola Topic leads the Adriatic League in assists and ranks second in scoring.\n\nQuestions over his athleticism aren’t setting off alarms thanks to his 6-foot-6 size, a 61.6 two-point percentage and surge in NBA star guards (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Brunson, Luka Doncic) who’ve excelled with shiftiness, footwork, IQ and skill over speed and explosion.\n\nHe’s demonstrated a special knack for beating defenders with timely moves, change of speed, surprise bursts and low ball-handling moves. And he’s outstanding off the dribble with his vision, passing feel and finishing craft.\n\nTopic would have a stronger first-pick case if he was shooting better from deep, but he’s still hit 17 threes in 12 games, and historically, he’s always been capable from behind the arc and over 80.0% from the free-throw line.\n\n3. Washington Wizards: Isaiah Collier\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 3\n    School/Team: USC\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 210 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Baron Davis\n\nThe biggest draws to Isaiah Collier right now are his shifty ball-handling and strength for attacking and finishing at the rim, along with his ability to create shots for teammates. These are aspects of his game that seem translatable, given his NBA positional tools/burst and how passing transitionally carries over.\n\nWashington should feel it can bank on Collier for rim pressure and playmaking at the least.\n\nHe’s also shot well early, both off the catch and with his mid-range pull-up. His jump shot still isn’t highly convincing, however, given the low-volume attempts and a borderline set shot that doesn’t seem super conducive for consistent long-range shooting.\n\nCollier’s decision-making is the most discussed flaw. He’s averaging 4.6 turnovers per game, coughing it up 34.4% of the time in ball-screen situations. Despite USC’s talented roster, it has lost three of eight games, and Collier ranks fifth on the team in box plus-minus.\n\nI’s also a difficult draft to nitpick a highly productive freshman, particularly one with outstanding physical tools, valuable creativity, obvious passing vision and a capable shot.\n\n4. Memphis Grizzlies: Zaccharie Risacher\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 5\n    School/Team: JL Bourg\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 204 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Harrison Barnes\n\nIn a class that’s missing convincing All-Star prospects, Zaccharie Risacher is building a case around a high floor.\n\nHe’s been on a heater over the past month, raising his 3-point mark to 45.6% between LNB Pro A and Eurocup. It’s illuminated some exciting shotmaking ability to complement his 6-foot-8 size, explosiveness, open-floor ball-handling and defensive versatility.\n\nThe case against Risacher as a top pick focuses on his current archetype and the unlikelihood he’ll operate as an offensive initiator in the half court. But at 18 years old with plenty of time/room to grow, his three-and-D floor and flashes of passing (at lower levels) should be enough to justify looking at Risacher in the top three of this particular draft.\n\n5. Portland Trail Blazers: Matas Buzelis\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 6\n    School/Team: G League Ignite\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 19\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 209 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Franz Wagner\n\nBack from an ankle injury, Matas Buzelis showcased his jumbo-guard skills and athleticism in two games for Ignite with open-floor ball-handling, fluid slashing, above-the-rim finishing and defensive contests.\n\nHe’s missed six of his first seven threes, but shooting isn’t a concern for Buzelis. He’s a comfortable three-level shot-maker with range, though the upside pops most when he’s creating into smooth drives and mid-range jumpers or fallaways.\n\nHe isn’t tight enough with the ball yet to consistently get to his spots in the half court. He’s looked vulnerable when pressured. A stronger frame and tighter handle should eventually help, and at 19 years old, scouts could think Buzelis can eventually achieve both.\n\n6. Chicago Bulls: Ron Holland\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 1\n    School/Team: G League Ignite\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 204 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Shawn Marion\n\nBack on track after a brief slump in November, Ron Holland has averaged 23.2 points on 52.7% over Ignite’s last five games.\n\nHe’s seemingly activated a different level of focus with his determination to attack defenders and cut down on turnovers. His explosiveness in the open floor is tough to top. And in the half court, he’s turning the corner, playing through contract until he’s gotten to the hoop or he’s putting back his own misses.\n\nThough his self-creation still isn’t great for a potential No. 1 overall wing prospect, he has still delivered some encouraging flashes, changing speeds and directions to shake free.\n\nAt this point, his 23.5 3-point percentage, 57.7 free-throw percentage and decision-making raise the most red flags, particularly for a limited creator and playmaker in the No. 1 overall mix. It’s almost becoming safer for teams to project more of an energizer type than a top option.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that he’s still scoring at a strong clip in the G League at 18 years old—without an advanced bag or jump shot—suggests Holland offers both a high floor and pathway to upside.\n\n7. Charlotte Hornets: Stephon Castle\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 7\n    School/Team: Connecticut\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 215 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Jimmy Butler\n\nStephon Castle’s return from a knee injury against North Carolina was mostly uneventful. Scouts are just pleased he’s back in the lineup, given the draft’s need for more star power and Castle’s promising start in November.\n\nScouts figure to be patient with the freshman, given the missed time, Connecticut’s depth and the long-term appeal of a 6’6? point-wing and strong, versatile defender.\n\nConcerns may pop up around his 3-point shooting and lack of explosion for creating separation. However, Castle plays at his own, slower pace that allows him to control possessions and defenders. And he’s showcased enough three-level shotmaking over the years to give him some wiggle room with his percentages.\n\n8. Utah Jazz: Ja’Kobe Walter\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 8\n    School/Team: Baylor\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 195 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\n\nThough Ja’Kobe Walter has been streaky this season, age, physical tools, obvious shotmaking skill and a weak lottery will earn him a pass.\n\nLimited creativity has been the biggest problem that’s led to difficult shots and no translatable playmaking (seven assists, eight games).\n\nStill, at 6-foot-5 with a strong frame, deep range, a runner/floater and the ability to shoot off movement, he should have the right skill set and body for three-level off-ball scoring.\n\n9. Portland Trail Blazers (via Warriors): Cody Williams\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 9\n    School/Team: Colorado\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 190 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Jerami Grant\n\nDespite performances at the Nike Hoop Summit, McDonalds All-American week and World Cup that painted Cody Williams as raw and unpolished, he’s averaging 14.0 points on 62.3% shooting.\n\nEven without any advanced creation or a high-usage jumper, he’s scoring efficiently, mostly by optimizing his positional height for separating and using footwork and touch around the paint.\n\nFlashes of 3-point shooting (6-of-10) and defensive effort have led to one of the most promising starts among freshmen.\n\nA lack of threes attempted and half-court creation/playmaking does raise some questions, but it’s difficult to nitpick Williams’ highly productive and efficient start.\n\n10. San Antonio Spurs (via Raptors): Ryan Dunn\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 14\n    School/Team: Virginia\n    Position: SF/PF\n    Age: 20, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 216 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Herb Jones\n\nRyan Dunn is making defensive plays at a rate we’ve never seen. And at 6’8? with elite-level explosion and foot speed, scouts are seeing translatable defensive playmaking and court coverage.\n\nThe question is how high it can push him up boards, since he’s just 4-of-19 from three and hasn’t demonstrated any real handle, creation or passing.\n\nIn the mid-first round, however, there aren’t a lot of prospect who offer certainty. And Dunn does with his defensive versatility and play-finishing, a combination that can be valuable in a specific role for a team that gets enough scoring.\n\n11. Atlanta Hawks: Rob Dillingham\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 25\n    School/Team: Kentucky\n    Position: PG/SG\n    Age: 18, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-3, 176 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Bones Hyland\n\nRob Dillingham has surprised scouts with his approach and willingness to move the ball. Averaging 5.4 assists to 1.6 turnovers, he’s sold himself so far as a point guard, rather than an undersized scoring combo.\n\nFor the most part, he’s picked the right times to showcase his self-creation and off-the-dribble shotmaking. And he’s off to a scorching start from three (16-of-32), hitting both pull-ups and rhythm spot-ups.\n\nScouts will be eager to see how he measures, given the questions around his projected finishing and defense. But Dillingham has been gaining more and more support with his new mentality that’s help lead to more efficient scoring and playmaking.\n\n12. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Rockets): Terrence Shannon Jr.\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 51\n    School/Team: Illinois\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 23, Senior\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 215 lbs\n\nTerrence Shannon Jr. moved the needle on his draft stock against Rutgers with 33 points that highlighted his blazing burst with the ball. While his rim pressure has always been well-documented, he showed more ability to slow down and create with deceleration and body control or use his gravity to draw help and find teammates.\n\nSo far this season, he’s also making 44.8% of his pull-ups and 38.7% of his catch-and-shoot chances.\n\nEven if his shooting comes and goes, teams could still see a pro and worthwhile first-round bet on Shannon’s streaky shotmaking when paired with electric driving, strong defensive tools and secondary playmaking.\n\n13. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Clippers): Donovan Clingan\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 13\n    School/Team: Connecticut\n    Position: C\n    Age: 19, Sophomore\n    Size: 7-foot-2, 280 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Walker Kessler\n\nDonovan Clingan didn’t earn any new fans after the Kansas game. Athletic limitations were exposed and held him back on some finishes, and he looked uncomfortable getting out to challenge Hunter Dickinson’s three-ball.\n\nNBA teams should still figure they’ll be able to bank on his 7-foot-2 size and anticipation in rim protection and his soft hands and 280-pound frame for easy baskets and boards. No versatility just may limit his suitors to teams that could use center depth, physicality and a shot-blocking presence.\n\n14. Houston Rockets (via Nets): Trevon Brazile\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 27\n    School/Team: Arkansas\n    Position: PF/C\n    Age: 20, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-10\n\nTrevon Brazile’s 19 points and 11 boards in a win over Duke highlighted the shotmaking and athleticism that are easy to picture fitting onto an NBA floor. His soft, high-arching 3-point stroke has become very convincing, while his tools and bounce around the basket create highly translatable finishing.\n\nContinuous flashes of drives past closeouts, body control off the dribble and touch shots should push Brazile in the first-round mix for most teams. As long as no post-ACL tear issues arise and his shot keeps falling, Arkansas should be sending another forward to the NBA.\n\n15. New Orleans Pelicans: Kevin McCullar Jr.\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 17\n    School/Team: Kansas\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 22, Senior\n    Size: 6-foot-7, 214 lbs\n\nA borderline draft pick in 2023, Kevin McCullar Jr. is altering previous evaluations and scouts’ thoughts with his improved shooting, aggressive slashing, passing/defensive IQ and impact on winning.\n\nElevated aggression has led to more finishes and playmaking, with McCullar now averaging 18.5 points and 5.1 assists. And he’s creating opportunities within Kansas’ offense—not with extra ball screens or isolation—currently generating 1.5 points per possessions out of spot-ups (97th percentile) and consistently making himself available for cuts (13-of-15).\n\nA dangerous transition ball-handler and effective off-ball scorer with strong defensive tools/instincts, McCullar may just need an average/capable catch-and-shoot game to solidify first-round interest. He hit three 3-pointers in the final six minutes to propel Kansas over Connecticut on Friday.\n\n16. Cleveland Cavaliers: Carlton Carrington\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 10\n    School/Team: Pittsburgh\n    Position: PG/SG\n    Age: 18, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 190 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Tyrese Maxey\n\nCarlton Carrington has cooled off, and now scouts are starting question which aspects of his hot start were legitimate.\n\nThe combination of 6’5? size, playmaking IQ and shotmaking versatility remain appealing. He’s still making high-level deliveries off lives dribbles. And despite the fact his jumper isn’t falling at the same rate as earlier, he’s looked comfortable from deep, pulling up and stepping back.\n\nBut the fact that he’s made just four shots at the rim and has three steals and zero blocks (eight games) is raising some worrisome questions about his athleticism and quickness.\n\n17. Miami Heat: Reed Sheppard\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 36\n    School/Team: Kentucky\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-3, 187 lbs\n\nNo player is generating more conversation and debate within scouting circles than Reed Sheppard.\n\nDespite Kentucky’s loss to Miami, he added another gem to the early-season reel with 26 points, nine boards and six assists. He’s now third in the NCAA in box plus-minus, consistently making positives plays while converting 63.0% of his twos, 61.1% of his threes, totaling 31 assists to seven turnovers and registering enormous defensive playmaking rates (6.1 STL percentage, 3.8 BLK percentage).\n\nThe numbers seemingly have to come back to earth at some point, but it’s pretty clear that Sheppard possesses elite shotmaking skill, high-IQ passing and excellent defensive instincts. While scouts will be waiting early to find out his actual height and wingspan, poor physical tools shouldn’t prevent his shooting, passing and reactions from translating in a connector role.\n\n18. Phoenix Suns: Kyle Filipowski\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 11\n    School/Team: Duke\n    Position: PF/C\n    Age: 20, Sophomore\n    Size: 7 feet, 248 lbs\n\nKyle Filipowski has been more effective this year inside the arc (61.5%), using his strength and touch to finish more post-ups, rolls in traffic and putbacks. His passing has continued to pop as well and remains a selling point on the scouting report.\n\nHe hasn’t appeared to make a jump this year with his three-ball, which continues to look capable but unreliable.\n\nThe big question with Filipowski asks whether his perimeter game can translate, which is what can help separate him from other 7-footers and NBA bench players. Filipowski clearly has range and body control handling in the open floor or beating bigs off the arc in space. But his shot has been inconsistent, and a high center of gravity makes it difficult to picture him blowing by NBA defenders.\n\nRegardless, in this draft, teams won’t nitpick too much when considering Filipowski’s size, skill level and NCAA impact/effectiveness.\n\n19. New York Knicks (via Mavs): Kel’el Ware\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 15\n    School/Team: Indiana\n    Position: C\n    Age: 19, Sophomore\n    Size: 7 feet, 242 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: Jarrett Allen\n\nAveraging 17.7 points and 9.6 boards, Kel’el Ware has handled almost every opposing frontcourt, giving them problems with his verticality, post game and touch.\n\nHe did struggle offensively in his only real test against Connecticut’s 280-pound center Donovan Clingan, who helped raise the importance that Ware continues to develop his shooting range to combat the stronger, interior-based centers.\n\nBut as long has he doesn’t drift during conference play, Ware’s combination of finishing, shot-blocking tools and shotmaking skill should prevent him from falling outside the top 20.\n\n20. Atlanta Hawks (via Kings): Dalton Knecht\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 39\n    School/team: Tennessee\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 22, Senior\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 204 lbs\n\nScouts were buzzing about Dalton Knecht’s 37 points against North Carolina. They’ve already started to brainstorm about a pro comparison for the 6-foot-6?, 40.5% 3-point shooter who’s also showcased some extra wiggle attacking the basket and explosion in the open floor.\n\nThere may be some questions about how much of his scoring will translate to the next level. But in a draft where there aren’t as many enticing high-upside teenagers available, Knecht could start to look like a persuasive shotmaker and tough role player in the late first round.\n\n21. Indiana Pacers: Ajay Mitchell\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: Off the board\n    School/Team: Santa Barbara\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 21, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 190 lbs\n\nAveraging 23.3 points and 4.3 assists on 72.3% true shooting, Ajay Mitchell has been getting to his spots, finishing with signature craft/touch and using his gravity to set up teammates.\n\nThe NBA is seeing many point guards succeed without athletic advantages for scouts to write off this shifty ball-handler. Scouts will want to see Mitchell continue creating and efficiently converting inside the arc against more credible opponents. And his 5-for-10 start from three is still small for a career 30.6% 3-point shooter.\n\nBut Mitchell is currently carving up defenses with the type of change of speed, shiftiness, footwork, layup adjustments, IQ and shotmaking for scouts to start looking past questions about separation ability or shooting numbers.\n\n22. New Orleans Pelicans (via Lakers): Bobi Klintman\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 24\n    School/Team: Cairns Taipans\n    Position: SF/PF\n    Age: 20\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 225 lbs\n    Pro Comparison: De’Andre Hunter\n\nBobi Klintman’s minutes and production have fluctuated lately, though the highlights should still outweigh the inconsistency and keep the 6-foot-8 forward in the first-round discussion\n\nThe flashes of open-floor ball-handling and passing, shooting, drives into runners and athletic finishing create appealing potential versatility from both forward spots. While he looked more like a stretch 4 at Wake Forest, Klintman has done a better job selling himself this year as a Swiss Army knife combo.\n\n23. New York Knicks: Caleb Foster\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: Off the board\n    School/Team: Duke\n    Position: PG/SG\n    Age: 19\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 197 lbs\n\nTyrese Proctor’s injury could open a door for Caleb Foster to receive more creation reps and ball screens. With just an 18.7% usage, the freshman has still given Duke an efficient source of bench offense in the form of rim pressure and three-level shotmaking.\n\nHe hasn’t been able to showcase any playmaking, though he’ll have a chance now if Proctor misses extended time.\n\nRegardless, Foster’s signature function is scoring with decisive ball-handling and strength for driving, a mid-range game and spot-up shooting behind the arc.\n\n24. Philadelphia 76ers: Tyrese Proctor\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 12\n    School/Team: Duke\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 19, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 183 lbs\n\nTyrese Proctor has made some marginal improvement this year, mostly with his finishing off drives and playmaking IQ.\n\nUnderwhelming offensive games in highly scouted matchups against Arkansas (3-for-12), Michigan State (4-for-12) and Arizona (3-for-9) have mostly cast a cloud over his better two-point percentage and assist-to-turnover ratio. The bar was also higher coming in this season as a sophomore, so it’s been difficult to get too excited about his 10.3 points and 4.8 dimes on 32.4% shooting from deep.\n\nAnd now he’s in jeopardy of missing an extended period of time with a leg injury.\n\nFlashes of shotmaking versatility, self-creation into jumpers and playmaking will keep interest alive in a 6-foot-5, 19-year-old combo. But a lengthy absence after his start will make it tough for Proctor to win over more NBA teams.\n\n25. Denver Nuggets: D.J. Wagner\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 26\n    School/Team: Kentucky\n    Position: PG/SG\n    Age: 18, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-4, 192 lbs\n\nAfter a forgettable game in a highly scouted matchup against Kansas, D.J. Wagner bounced back the following week to combine for 50 points in wins over Marshall and Saint Joseph’s. An ankle injury suffered against Miami came at an unfortunate time, though it’s not expected to keep the freshman out long.\n\nWagner does have questions to answer, some about his shooting, others about his tools/athleticism for finishing, and more regarding his projected NBA role. Rob Dillingham has been the more effective playmaker and shotmaker in Kentucky’s backcourt, while Wagner has had more success putting pressure on the defense and rim with his driving.\n\nWagner is still likely a better shooter than the early numbers suggest, and despite missing practically every layup attempt against Kansas, he’s converting 61.5% of his attempts around the basket.\n\nAside from attacking off his signature quick-dribble moves, Wagner hasn’t looked highly proficient in any one area, which may make it difficult for lottery teams to fall in love, particularly for a prospect who doesn’t pop physically or athletically.\n\n26. Indiana Pacers (via Thunder): Baba Miller\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 22\n    School/Team: Florida State\n    Position: SF/PF\n    Age: 19, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-11, 204 lbs\n\nWith the idea of a potential breakout coming after Baba Miller’s promising World Cup, the lack of offense and aggression could be seen as a turnoff. But there have been clear signs of progression and elevated confidence, and Florida State’s production is historically spread out.\n\nShooting 42.9% from deep, Miller already has more threes in seven games than he hit in 15 last year. With his long strides and fluidity at 6-foot-11, he’s been effective attacking and finishing in the open floor, and his length and defensive activity have translated to 1.6 steals and 1.3 blocks in 23.0 minutes.\n\n27. Orlando Magic: Justin Edwards\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 18\n    School/Team: Kentucky\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 203 lbs\n\nJustin Edwards has given Kentucky an efficient play-finisher, driving threat and capable spot-up shooter.\n\nScouts are still trying to determine what he’ll give an NBA team, however. A limited ball-handler who’s at 25.9% from three, averaging 1.0 assist per game, Edwards is starting to look like a vulnerable name on draft boards.\n\nBecoming a plus shotmaker seems like a must to justify going in the lottery or even mid-first round. It’s still too early to write off more improvement. He’s made strides over the past year, also showing some ability to pull up inside the arc. A competent jumper would give Edwards enough spot-up scoring skills for a 6-foot-8 wing who can cover defensive ground.\n\n28. Milwaukee Bucks: Tristan da Silva\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 29\n    School/Team: Colorado\n    Position: SF/PF\n    Age: 22, Senior\n    Size: 6-foot-9, 220 lbs\n\nWhile scouts may question how much of Tristan da Silva’s two-point scoring can translate, his shooting remains highly convincing. The 6-foot-9 forward is at 45.5% from three and 84.4% from the line.\n\nThough he may struggle to blow by or separate around the basket, he uses off-ball movement to free himself up, and he remains a threat to make shots out of the post.\n\n29. Boston Celtics: Adem Bona\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 16\n    School/Team: UCLA\n    Position: C\n    Age: 20, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-10, 245 lbs\n\nAdem Bona’s scoring rate is up this year, mostly because he looks more polished and in command playing with his back to the basket.\n\nStill, NBA teams will only be banking on his athleticism for play-finishing and shot-blocking. The question is whether he can create enough of a defensive impact in rim protection (at 6-foot-10 with fouling issues) to offset his lack of creating, shooting or passing.\n\n30. Minnesota Timberwolves: Tidjane Salaun\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 31\n    School/Team: Cholet\n    Position: PF\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 212 lbs\n\nThough Tidjane Salaun has been struggling in Pro A, at 18 years old with an exciting mix of size, athleticism and shotmaking, NBA teams will put more stock into flashes than consistency or overall production. And he delivered some serious flashes on Tuesday with five 3-point makes to score 24 points for Cholet.\n\nHe’s still more of an idea at this point, as he’s shooting just 29.5% in Pro A. But the thought of an explosive 6-foot-8 forward with a jumper may be enough to draw first-round interest from teams willing to gamble on upside.\n\n31. New York Knicks (via Pistons): Tyler Smith\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 32\n    School/Team: G League Ignite\n    Position: SF/PF\n    Age: 19\n    Size: 6-foot-11, 224 lbs\n\nFor a big, Tyler Smith’s shooting has earned him mentions in the first-round conversation. He’s also cooled off lately, and the rest of his game is mostly physical tools-dependent.\n\nThe combination of shooting and finishing should be enough for him to find a spot in the league. Encouraging passing flashes should create more margin for error as well. But he’s not a high-level rim protector, and he doesn’t project as a big who’ll be putting the ball down often.\n\nHe’ll sell teams on his jump shot and stretch-4 potential. As long as he gets back on track from behind the arc, where he’s at 42.4% despite missing 12 of his last 14 attempts, Smith could be in play for teams in the 20s.\n\n32. Detroit Pistons (via Wizards): Oso Ighodaro\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 34\n    School/Team: Marquette\n    Position: C\n    Age: 21, Senior\n    Size: 6-foot-11, 235 lbs\n\nNBA teams interested in Oso Ighodaro will be drawn to his ability to give the lineup a unique look with his ball-handling and passing from the center position. He’s different for his ability to act as a 5 who offense can run through from the foul line or top of the key.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be big scoring or defensive upside, but his push/touch shots around the key should be effective, and his size and mobility should still translate to off-ball shot-blocking.\n\n33. San Antonio Spurs: Wooga Poplar\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 37\n    School/Team: Miami\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 20, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 197 lbs\n\nScouts have started to pick up on Wooga Poplar’s improvement this year with his shooting and overall shotmaking versatility.\n\nThough non-playmaking guards have limited margin for error, his explosiveness, pull-up game (12-for-25) and spot-up threes (11-for-21) suddenly point to some enticing scoring potential.\n\nConsistent athletic defensive plays should continue to help scouts look past the limited creation.\n\n34. Minnesota Timberwolves (via Grizzlies): Kylan Boswell\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 23\n    School/Team: Arizona\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 18, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-2, 195 lbs\n\nKylan Boswell has showcased high-level connector skills with his 54.3% 3-point shooting and passing IQ.\n\nHe just doesn’t put much pressure on the rim, as he’s converted one driving layup and attempted six free throws in seven games.\n\nHowever, NBA teams may still picture a reserve combo who can add value with his transition playmaking, shotmaking, decision-making and strength/low center of gravity defending ball-handlers.\n\n35. Milwaukee Bucks (via Blazers): Yves Missi\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 41\n    School/Team: Baylor\n    Position: C\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 7 feet, 235 lbs\n\nShooting 61.4% with a 19.8 rebounding percentage and 13.0 block percentage, Yves Missi has optimized his physical tools and athleticism around the basket.\n\nThere isn’t anything sexy or versatile about his game, but easy-basket targets and rim protectors like the Baylor player are still coveted by teams looking for frontcourt depth.\n\n36. Boston Celtics (via Bucks): Izan Almansa\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 19\n    School/Team: G League Ignite\n    Position: PF\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 6-foot-10, 216 lbs\n\nThe draw to Izan Almansa stems from his instincts and hands for play-finishing off the ball and rebounding. Occasionally, he surprises with some open-floor ball-handling, drives past closeouts and threes.\n\nThe fear with Almansa is that he doesn’t have any go-to method for scoring, which we’re seeing in the G League. He’s not making jumpers, and a lack of face-up game and athleticism limit him.\n\nAlmansa is ultimately the type of big who’ll make plays without needing any called for him. And at 18 years old, he has time to improve his shot and slim down to become a bit quicker off the bounce and floor.\n\n37. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hornets): KJ Lewis\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 28\n    School/Team: Arizona\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 6-foot-4, 205 lbs\n\nIt may be premature to project KJ Lewis to the 2024 draft, but with Arizona No. 1 in the AP poll, the national spotlight seems bound to start illuminating his athleticism, defense, passing and impact.\n\nStarting to make threes would really jump-start the hype, but he doesn’t project as a player who’ll be valued for scoring. So, while the lack of creation, shotmaking and production does suggest limited upside, it shouldn’t kill NBA interest.\n\nWith quickness, strength and energy, Lewis leads the Wildcats’ rotation in defensive box plus-minus while adding play-finishing and ball-moving.\n\n38. New York Knicks (via Jazz): Trey Alexander\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 21\n    School/Team: Creighton\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 20, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-4, 190 lbs\n\nIronically, the area where Trey Alexander has struggled most this year is what NBA teams should feel most confident in. He’s been off so far from three, but last year’s season and his shooting versatility still point to promising shotmaking potential.\n\nThe increase in assist rate this year has been promising, as teams wanted to see more on-ball creation. There are just questions how effective he’ll be blowing by or separating against NBA defenders.\n\n39. LA Clippers (via Raptors): Hunter Sallis\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 54\n    School/Team: Wake Forest\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 21, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 185 lbs\n\nScouts should start to take Hunter Sallis seriously if he carries November’s flashes of creation, three-level shotmaking and athletic finishing into conference play.\n\nThey’ve seemingly come out of nowhere, given his limited role at Gonzaga the past two seasons. But he is now averaging 19.1 points, shooting 54.5% inside the arc and 44.2% from three.\n\n40. Houston Rockets (via Warriors): Kobe Johnson\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 48\n    School/Team: USC\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 20, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 200 lbs\n\nKobe Johnson continues to give off NBA role-player vibes with his passing, defense and improved shotmaking. Showing he can make threes was a key entering the season, and so far he’s hitting a respectable 1.7 per game.\n\nRegardless, athleticism, instincts and positional tools will remain the key draws to Johnson, who isn’t the highest level creator, scorer or shooter.\n\n41. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Rockets): Melvin Ajinca\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 40\n    School/Team: Saint-Quentin\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 19\n    Size: 6-foot-7\n\nMevlin Ajinca just had his best game of the year on Monday, hitting four-of-five threes and bringing us back to the shotmaking clinic he put on at the U19 World Cup.\n\nHe hasn’t showcased too much outside of shooting this season, but when it’s paired with a strong 6’7? frame at 19 years old, teams could picture a high floor that has room to rise.\n\n42. Los Angeles Lakers (via Clippers): Alex Karaban\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 45\n    School/Team: Connecticut\n    Position: PF\n    Age: 21, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 220 lbs\n\nA recent cold streak has brought down Alex Karaban’s 3-point percentage, but the eye test sees a legit shooter and bonus versatility tied to his passing, floater touch and defensive foot speed.\n\nTeams more interested in finding the right fit than upside could target him as a rotational stretch 4.\n\n43. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hawks): Tyler Kolek\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 49\n    School/Team: Marquette\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 22, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-3, 195 lbs\n\nThere isn’t any mystery of Tyler Kolek’s strengths, weaknesses or projected NBA role. He’s highly advanced in ball-screen situations with his pace and playmaking feel. And the ability to catch-and-shoot (10-of-18) creates some versatility for him to slide off the ball and stretch the floor.\n\nOn the other hand, he struggles to blow by without a screen, and he continues to struggle shooting off the dribble.\n\nKolek should still get looks from teams who could use an extra pick-and-roll ball-handler with some shotmaking appeal.\n\n44. Houston Rockets (via Nets): Aday Mara\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No 20\n    School/Team: UCLA\n    Position: C\n    Age: 18, Freshman\n    Size: 7-foot-3, 240 lbs\n\nAday Mara remains appealing for his size, touch around the key, post skill and shot-blocking tools. But coach Mick Cronin played him six minutes against Maquette, and he picked up three fouls in three minutes against Gonzaga.\n\nSlow feet and an old-school game won’t help teams picture too much upside. He’s starting to look more like an appealing second-round pick who could give a team some more interior help, passing from the center position and a secondary scoring option in the mid-to-short range.\n\n45. New Orleans Pelicans: Judah Mintz\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 43\n    School/Team: Syracuse\n    Position: PG/SG\n    Age: 20, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-4, 185 lbs\n\nFor the most part, the scouting report on Judah Mintz has remained the same, as he’s at his best attacking the rim or using ball screens and gravity to set up teammates.\n\nBut he’s coming off a career-best five made threes against Cornell, raising his mark to 46.7%. More volume shooting and shotmaking will make it easier for scouts to picture a pro.\n\nMintz still relies heavily on penetrating and drawing fouls (8.1 FTA per game), which may generate mixed reactions.\n\n46. LA Clippers (via Cavs): Trentyn Flowers\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 44\n    School/Team: Adelaide 36ers\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 18\n    Size: 6-foot-8, 205 lbs\n\nThe NBL game has slowed down for Trentyn Flowers, as he’s now at 46.5% from the floor and 43.5% from three on the season.\n\nThe point guard experiment didn’t go well, but his shooting stroke is highly convincing, and that combination of 6-foot-8 size, shotmaking and athleticism doesn’t require high-level creation or decision-making for an off-ball scoring role.\n\n47. Miami Heat: Aaron Bradshaw\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No 30\n    School/Team: Kentucky\n    Position: C\n    Age: 19, Freshman\n    Size: 7-foot-1, 226 lbs\n\nBack from a foot injury, Aaron Bradshaw made his debut during Kentucky’s loss to UNC Wilmington. He wasn’t involved much in 13 minutes, and scouts will need time to fairly assess the big man’s rim protection, switchability, shooting and feel.\n\nIdeally, he is able to showcase some of the shotmaking he’s added to his bag over the years while making Kentucky tougher defensively.\n\nAt first glance, though, he didn’t move super gracefully or quickly. And given the Wildcats’ guard-heavy rotation, it’s difficult to picture Bradshaw having much freedom to make plays outside the paint.\n\n48. Washington Wizards (via Suns): Riley Kugel\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 38\n    School/Team: Florida\n    Position: SG\n    Age: 19, Sophomore\n    Size: 6-foot-5, 207 lbs\n\nAfter shooting just 36.2% through five games, Riley Kugel bounced back with 49 points on 8-for-12 shooting from three in losses to Wake Forest and Baylor.\n\nShotmaking consistency and decision-making will be key for his draft stock, as it’s unlikely he’ll offer much outside of scoring. But there can be some tempting potential tied to his slashing athleticism, self-creation and dribble-jumper game.\n\n49. Indiana Pacers: Dillon Jones\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 46\n    School/Team: Weber State\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 22, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-6, 235 lbs\n\nWhile some NBA teams may question Dillon Jones’ position and fit, one is bound to think out of the box and gamble on unique versatility.\n\nConsistently a ball-handling threat, a plus passer, double-digit rebounder and excellent free-throw shooter, he has also started 6-of-15 from three.\n\nThe obvious question asks whether he’s effective enough to use on the ball, and if he’ll have the skill set to play off it on the wing.\n\n50. Sacramento Kings: Reece Beekman\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 52\n    School/Team: Virginia\n    Position: PG\n    Age: 22, Senior\n    Size: 6-foot-3, 194 lbs\n\nMoving up boards will be difficult for Reece Beekman without him showing any noticeable improvement as a shooter.\n\nHe could be a popular second-round target from teams that see a serviceable bench guard who’ll add value with defensive ball pressure and the ability to run offense and pass.\n\n51. Boston Celtics (via Mavs): Zvonimir Ivisic\n\n    Stock Status: Down\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 35\n    School/Team: Kentucky\n    Position: PF/C\n    Age: 20, Freshman\n    Size: 7-foot-2, 234 lbs\n\nScouts and Kentucky are still waiting on the debut of Zvonimir Ivišic, who’s missed time due to sickness after eligibility issues initially caused a delay. The fact that he came out for pregame warmups over the weekend was seen as a positive sign.\n\nThere has been a buildup of anticipation after he averaged 11.4 points, 3.4 blocks and 1.6 threes for Croatia at the U20 European Championship. At 7-foot-2, his flashes of open-floor ball-handling, drives from the arc and shooting point to enticing upside.\n\nScouts just want a better feel for how realistic it is, and how legitimate his range, defensive mobility and feel for the game are.\n\n52. San Antonio Spurs (via Lakers): Zach Edey\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 57\n    School/Team: Purdue\n    Position: C\n    Age: 21, Senior\n    Size: 7-foot-4, 300lbs\n\nAveraging 25.6 points and 11.7 boards over Purdue’s last seven games, Zach Edey has become dominant enough with his size, touch and footwork for teams to see a worthwhile second-round game.\n\nMaking 73.3% of his free-throws should be considered a key plus as well. And he’s blocking a career-best 10.5% of his opponents’ shots.\n\n53. Philadelphia 76ers (via Knicks): Matthew Cleveland\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 42\n    School/Team: Miami\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 21, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-7, 208 lbs\n\nShooting will always be Matthew Cleveland’s key swing skill, given his lack of self-creation and playmaking. Now 8-for-17 from three, he’s off to the best start of his career while continuing to produce off athletic plays, instincts and mid-range shotmaking (70.5% 2PT).\n\n54. Houston Rockets (via Thunder): Nikola Djurisic\n\n    Stock Status: Steady\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: No. 50\n    School/Team: Mega MIS\n    Position: SG/SF\n    Age: 19\n    Size: 6-foot-7, 214 lbs\n\nNikola Djurisic is still struggling with shooting consistency, but there aren’t any questions about his shotmaking capability. And he’s still providing impressive playmaking ability that helps separate him from other 6-foot-8 wings.\n\nThough it would be difficult to draw first-round interest after another season shooting below 30.0% from three, a 19-year-old with potential shoot-dribble-pass connector skills should still seem like an appealing second-round gamble.\n\n55. Orlando Magic: Harrison Ingram\n\n    Stock Status: Up\n    Previous Mock Draft Spot: Off the board\n    School/Team: North Carolina\n    Position: SF\n    Age: 21, Junior\n    Size: 6-foot-7, 235lbs\n\nAfter two years underachieving at Stanford, Harrison Ingram is shooting 48.5% with North Carolina, making 2.1 threes at a 46.3% clip.\n\nVersatility was always the main draw to the wide-framed Ingram, who could handle in pick-and-rolls and play-make with power forward size.\n\nA consistent shot, which he hasn’t shown until now, could be enough to give him connector potential for the next level.\n\n56.

        "articleBody": "“After a courageous and hard fought battle I’m sad to say that Ryan lost his fight with cancer this afternoon,” his twin brother, Damon Minor, posted on X.\n\nRyan Minor, the Baltimore Orioles infielder who replaced Cal Ripken at the end of the Hall of Famer’s record for consecutive games played, died on Friday at the age of 49.\n\n“After a courageous and hard fought battle I’m sad to say that Ryan lost his fight with cancer this afternoon,” his twin brother, Damon Minor, posted on X. “He truly was the best twin brother you can ask for. His family and I want to thank everyone for the prayers and support during this time. BOOMER SOONER.”\n\nDrafted by the Orioles in 1996, Minor made his big league debut late in the 1998 season. Then, a week later — on Sept. 20 — he was thrust into the spotlight. In the team’s final home game of the season, Ripken decided to end his streak at 2,632 consecutive games. Minor started at third base for the first time in his career.\n\n“I had no idea when I was coming to the park,” Minor said at the time.\n\nMinor went on to play parts of four seasons for the Orioles and Montreal Expos, appearing in 142 major league games.\n\n“We are deeply saddened by the passing of former third baseman and longtime minor league manager Ryan Minor, who courageously fought cancer,” the Orioles said in a statement on X. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Ryan’s family and friends at this time.”\n\nThis past summer, the Delmarva Shorebirds — an Orioles minor league affiliate — made his No. 44 the first jersey number in team history to be retired. He hit 24 home runs for Delmarva in 1997 while working his way toward the majors, and he later managed the team from 2010-12 and 2014-17. He also had multiple stints managing the Frederick Keys.\n\nIn a statement, the Shorebirds said the team was “deeply saddened” by his death and offered its condolences to his family and friends.\n\nMinor attended the University of Oklahoma, where he starred in baseball and basketball. At Oklahoma, Minor pitched and played first base. He helped the Sooners win a national title in baseball in 1994, and he was named Big Eight Player of the Year in 1995 on the basketball court. The 6-foot-6 Minor finished with 1,946 points and was drafted in the second round by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1996, the same year the Orioles took him.\n\nThe school’s athletic department remembered Minor as a “two-sport standout.”\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with Ryan’s family,” the Sooners said in a statement. “May he rest in peace.”\n\nThe Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame recently announced that Minor would be part of its 2024 class of inductees.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Allyson, and their two daughters, the University of Oklahoma Athletics Department said.",

        "articleBody": "Apple’s horror series loses sight of the drama and grief at its center.\n\nLast fall, a TV series premiered about a man in New York City whose wife has disappeared without a trace. He searches for her in vain, both longing for his lost love and furious with her for her transgression against him and their children. As he embarks upon this quest, the very cityscape of Manhattan turns itself upside down, a repeated cinematographic trick meant to visually emphasize the degree to which this man’s reality has been unsettled by loss. As viewers, we are so close to his perspective that his anger and his grief are palpable; they are the ground upon which we walk.\n\nBut then, there’s a twist! In the penultimate episode, we see the show’s events from the point of view of the lost wife. In place of this man’s story of abandonment and betrayal, we see a woman’s story of pain disbelieved, of subjectivity unrecognized, of trauma ignored. The man, it turns out, was the source and amplifier of this woman’s anguish rather than the hero seeking to save her from it. The twist comes late enough that we end up spending much more time with that guy anyway, but still: The story you thought you were watching was not the story you were actually watching all along.\n\nThe show I’m talking about, of course, is FX’s Fleishman Is in Trouble, Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s 2022 comedy of manners about wealthy New Yorkers in crisis, but nearly every description I’ve offered—down to the topsy-turvy camera gimmick—might also apply to Apple TV+’s new horror-drama The Changeling. The show is an ambitious, and relatively faithful, adaptation by veteran screenwriter Kelly Marcel of Victor LaValle’s acclaimed 2017 novel of the same name, and it’s characterized by the novel’s signature melting pot of cultural, historical, and mythical references. Nominally the story of a couple going through the turmoil of new parenthood, it’s also, explicitly, a fairy tale, replete with witches and mole people and fairies.\n\nLike Fleishman, the show is centrally concerned with modern parenthood, but The Changeling intermingles the mundanities of child-rearing with the marvelousness of folklore. So, alongside contemporary tales like the hero’s journey of the “good dad” and the almost supernatural, enforced invisibility of women’s pain, we have Scandinavian mythology, urban legend, and even social media typologies. North Brother Island in the East River becomes a locus of sorcery and enchantment; the nurseries and playgrounds of infanthood attain the same level of magic and dread by association.\n\nBut, also like Fleishman, The Changeling tells the story of a woman’s pain by way of her husband. In Fleishman, the real story was always that of a woman erased, not a woman missing. We are meant to be chastened as viewers when we realize how credulously we had believed the man’s version of events. The Changeling’s tale of a woman’s pain is less hidden from us than it is smothered by a television series too busy, too pleased with its own bravado, to give it the time and attention it deserves. Why are we spending so much time inside the Trojan horse?\n\nThe Changeling begins in 1968 with the meet-not-so-cute of white parole officer Brian West (Jared Abrahamson) and recent Ugandan immigrant Lillian Kagwa (played by Alexis Louder in flashback and Adina Porter in the present). Brian asks Lillian out on a date, and she refuses him, but he persists, asking and asking until she finally relents nearly 10 years later. They marry and have a son named Apollo. Thirtysomething years later, Apollo (played by a number of actors at different ages but finally LaKeith Stanfield in the present) has his own chance encounter with the lovely, hard-to-get Emma (Clark Backo). Their early relationship uncannily echoes that of Apollo’s own parents: Emma, like Lillian, agrees to her suitor’s overtures only after multiple rejections; on the first date, Apollo, like Brian, very bluntly declares that his main goal in life is to have children and be a good father; both couples appear to fall instantly in love. You may find these gestures a bit aggressive, though it’s sometimes unclear whether the show finds them romantic, threatening, or some mixture of both.\n\nThe wrinkles in these parallel stories are the source of the show’s main mysteries. In the earlier timeline, the main puzzle is Brian’s abandonment of Lillian and Apollo, as well as the later arrival of a box of his belongings labeled IMPROBABILIA, which contains, among other things, an eerie children’s book about fairies who like eating babies. The wrinkles in the present timeline both focus on Emma. In between her first date with Apollo and their eventual marriage, Emma goes on a months-long journey to Brazil. There, against the advice of locals, she visits a witch who ties a red string around her wrist and grants her three wishes. Upon her return, Emma relays this story to Apollo, who utters his catchphrase—“I am the god Apollo”—and cuts the string from her wrist. “With me, all three of your wishes will come true,” he tells her. Again, it sounds like a threat.\n\nThe two soon marry, and Emma announces she’s pregnant. In a harrowing and surprisingly funny set piece, Emma gives birth in a subway car—a crew of subway dancers provide moral and logistical support—but life after baby is no fairy tale, or at least not a Disney one. After her brief parental leave, Emma begins to exhibit symptoms of postpartum depression, anxiety, and even psychosis. She also begins to receive strange text messages with pictures of her baby that appear to have been taken from a distance, and which disappear from her phone before she can show them to anybody. During this time, Emma comes to believe that her son has been replaced by unseen forces, and that the baby she and Apollo now care for is a changeling.\n\nClark Backo is very simply an electrifying actor. When The Changeling is able to pull off its magical realist gambit, it is almost always because of Backo’s versatile performance. Emma visits a priest and schedules a baptism in the last-ditch hope that maybe the Holy Spirit can intercede in whatever’s going on in her life. We see her pitch the idea to Apollo—a god, but also an atheist—and later we see her meet the priest in flashback. In both scenes, we watch Backo alternate between the scary certainty of a mind possessed and the unnerving chaos of a mind ill-at-ease. These interpretations flit visibly past each other on Backo’s face—both conveying the reality of a woman in the midst of a real-life horror story and making us question what is true.\n\nBut The Changeling is not a show about Emma; it’s a show about her disappearance. And so, after she commits a horrifically violent act (off-screen, thank goodness) and subsequently vanishes, the show follows Apollo on his search for her. He finds a rare book, meets and joins forces with a troll, and he discovers a colony of feminist witches in the East River. Amid these incredibly confusing events, he shows an extraordinary lack of curiosity, rarely asking his captors and interlocutors the questions he—and we as viewers—need answered in order to move forward. His egotism and myopia further blur our view of the larger puzzle. He exudes an unshakable confidence in his own righteousness, whether he is flashing back to Emma telling him what a good father he will be or winning over the witches with his dadly energy. “You’re a good man,” one of them tells him, for seemingly no reason at all other than that he showed up.\n\nOn its own, this might be a keen insight about contemporary parenting, that women have to work three times as hard to be seen as competent parents, while men are greeted as feminist heroes for solo outings with their infant children. But the show doesn’t exactly go in that direction: While The Changeling spends a good amount of time on the various betrayals and complex ethical negotiations that define “good” motherhood, Apollo’s status as a “good father” is relatively unquestioned. The Changeling wants to—and frequently does—use Emma to tell a knotty, empathetic story about the violence and longing inherent in motherhood. Apollo, meanwhile, declares his intention to be a good father in the pilot, and the show simply grants his wish.\n\nIn a great 2018 essay, the critic Lili Loofbourow describes a media environment well aware of the grip “the male gaze” once had on Hollywood. Filmmakers and showrunners might want to avoid the lurid objectification of women, but they have replaced that gaze with what she calls “the male glance.” Instead of being leered at, women are simply ignored, not attended to at all. “Rather than linger lovingly on the parts it wants most to penetrate,” Loofbourow writes, the male glance “looks, assumes, and moves on.” It is a means of dismissing women’s stories as not worth the trouble, “forgetting to zoom in,” as Loofbourow elsewhere writes. Rather than settling into voyeurism, we don’t watch at all.\n\nSometimes, then, narratives about women’s pain—childbirth, routine medical procedures performed without anesthesia, the disbelief and dismissal that greets women suffering from postpartum depression, anxiety, or psychosis—come to us initially through the stories of their husbands or partners. Granted this cultural power of magnetism and capaciousness, a canny writer might wonder if that male magnetism was enough to draw viewers into women’s stories they might not otherwise encounter; what if that capaciousness were enough to hold them? So, up rolls the Trojan horse.\n\nTo The Changeling’s credit, it does not simply sign over Emma’s story to Apollo. We certainly view her own experience earlier and more often than Fleishman allows. But it’s not only Apollo working to avert our eyes from Emma: Her horror story frequently gets lost beneath the spectacle of all this revisionist mythmaking. Though sometimes we encounter a thrilling admixture of myth and reality, each episode calls upon so many different touchstones with such frenetic frequency that it can’t possibly do them all justice. One episode hopscotches between the 1968 New York City garbage strike, a shadow play of the Ugandan genocide, and a mournful fantasy about the early AIDS crisis—all as background for the story of one marriage’s dissolution. The show simply doesn’t have enough time to do more than transform these events into metaphors at best or background scenery at worst. As visually striking as it is, it’s hard to feel that the scene in which two Lena Horne impersonators sing the entirety of “Stormy Weather” to a naked man dying of AIDS is an earned moment, considering that the AIDS crisis has no overt bearing on the rest of the plot, and the man himself is a figment of another character’s imagination.\n\nIn a version of this series that accomplished all it’s trying to do, every one of these fantastical diversions and gritty realities would play into one another, each reinforcing some unexpected other element of the story, producing a sense of organic connection, of historical and spiritual transcendence. As one character explains, “the new fears are the old fears, and the old fears are ancient.” More often, though, the show feels distracted by all of its elements. Their resonances come off as strained or thin rather than revelatory, their invocations neither infectiously playful nor movingly serious.\n\nBoth for its promise and its missteps, then, The Changeling can be a frustrating show to watch. The witch whom Emma eventually meets in the middle of the East River promises her, and all the other women she finds there, “a place where they will be believed.” The show believes Emma, too; it just won’t stay with her, for reasons both fantastical and familiar.",

        "articleBody": "Police received a complaint over the book, so an officer went to hunt it down.\n\nFree speech advocates are slamming a police officer going to a Massachusetts middle school to search for a single book.\n\nOn December 8, an anonymous caller contacted the police department in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, to complain that an obscene book was available to eighth grade students at the W.E.B. Du Bois Regional Middle School. An officer was sent to investigate.\n\nThe book in question is Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe. The memoir does contain sexually explicit illustrations and language, but more importantly, it discusses the writer’s confusion about and understanding of gender.\n\nThe police alerted the school district superintendent and the Du Bois principal, but no one told the teacher accused of having the book. The principal escorted the police officer to the English teacher’s classroom after school let out, catching the teacher by surprise. The book was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union condemned the fact that a police officer was sent to look for a book. The organization said it could not remember this happening before.\n\n“That’s partly what is so concerning,” Ruth A. Bourquin, the senior and managing attorney for the ACLU of Massachusetts, told The Berkshire Eagle. “Police going into schools and searching for books is the sort of thing you hear about in communist China and Russia. What are we doing?”\n\nJustin Silverman, the executive director of the New England First Amendment Coalition, was worried that this won’t be the last time the police are asked to get involved in school literature. “While it might be rare now, it doesn’t mean that it will be rare in the future,” he said.\n\nMore than 100 students and teachers in the state organized a walkout last Friday to protest the police involvement in the incident. Some students said they suspected the larger issue was the LGBTQ themes in the book, not the sexual images.\n\nGender Queer is generally recommended for ages 14 and up, but it really depends on the maturity level of each individual reader. The teacher who had it in her classroom has remained anonymous, but she did initially write about the investigation on social media.\n\nShe noted that she has many years of experience as an English teacher. “How on earth is a cop more qualified to decide what books are OK to be in an educational setting for teens?” she wrote.\n\nThe Du Bois school librarian, Jennifer Guerin, pointed out that the point of having such a book around is “not about forcing a book into students’ hands” but making sure that such a resource is accessible.\n\n“It’s about the freedom to read,” she said. “It’s about providing voluntary access to a well-written, highly acclaimed resource in a safe place for a teenager who might want or need it.”",

        "articleBody": "A viral tweet shaming Pierce Brosnan’s wife’s weight has backfired for an unexpected reason.\n\nA viral tweet attempting to shame model, journalist and producer Keely Shaye Smith has backfired spectacularly.\n\nSmith, 60, is married to actor Pierce Brosnan, 70; the two met in 1994, married in 2001 and have gone on to have two sons together.\n\nThey are one of the rare Hollywood couples who have lasted and the James Bond star has always spoken glowingly about their marriage, recently telling Peoplejust how much he loves his wife.\n\n“I found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good,” he declared.\n\nThe award-winning actor has also referred to Smith as his “best friend” and described her as his “north star.”\n\nDespite their marriage being a long-lasting success, a tweet by an account describing itself as “campaigning against misandrist educational institutions who failed men” reposted photos of the couple taken side-by-side and warned men off getting married.\n\n“Your daily reminder to avoid marriage,” the tweet was captioned.\n\nThe pictures have been taken over a decade apart, and the direct comparison shows how they’ve both aged through the years.\n\nThe tweet was clearly commenting on the fact that Smith has gained weight. Sure, she’s had two children and still looks incredible, but apparently, that is worth talking about.\n\nThe tweet intended to poke fun at Smith’s weight and somehow suggest that women “let themselves go” during marriage.\n\nIt also wasn’t just reaching a quiet corner of the internet; over 43 million people have seen it, and to put that in perspective, Australia’s entire population hovers at around 26 million people. \n\nThere’s no pretending that the tweet wasn’t partly successful in getting people to comment gross things about women, weight and marriage. It is the internet; you’re never going to be short of finding someone with something mean to say.\n\nThe tweet was also hijacked by people defending Smith and the marriage claim the account was trying to make.\n\nIt overwhelmingly became a conversation about how great Smith looks and how wonderful their marriage sounds.\n\nSome people responded, pointing out that she looked “lovely” or “beautiful” in both photos, and another just wrote that she looked “gorgeous” and added whoever tweeted the images should “get over themselves.”\n\nOthers replied to point out the flawed thinking that these pictures could ever be seen as a marriage deterrent.\n\n“Yes, because staying a size two forever is the real meaning behind everlasting love,” someone joked\n\nAnother pointed out that the photos are just a reminder that a “good marriage” can go the distance.\n\nWhile someone else wrote that this tweet goes against everything Brosnan has ever said about his wife.\n\n“This man is happy in his marriage and has spoken openly about how he loves her body and doesn’t want her to change it,” she argued.\n\nOne woman pointed out skinniness doesn’t always make you more attractive.\n\n“Going to just pretend there aren’t guys that prefer this huh?” she asked. \n\nWhile another said men should beware of accounts like this that spew this kind of thinking because it will “ruin their lives” if they listen.\n\nThe tweet went so viral that American television personality and John McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, even commented.\n\n“You know he’s obsessed with her, right? Like absolutely obsessed, talks about it in interviews all the time, and they have been married like 20 years,” she wrote.",

But where did the name come from? Back in the 1800s, ‘Boxing Day’ would be when the affluent would give their servants and staff a day off and bequeath them with a boxed gift they would take home to share with their families. Now the day is widely regarded as one of Australia’s biggest shopping events of the year.\n\nWant more discounts?

        "articleBody": "Former NFL player and scout Bucky Brooks knows the ins and outs of this league, providing keen insight in his notebook. In today's installment, he spotlights players who have positioned themselves to break the bank on the open market ...\n\nAs the 2023 NFL regular season winds down, we are about to completely shift our focus to the postseason tournament. But in the meantime, it is important for personnel folks to update their scouting reports on players who could enter free agency in the offseason.\n\nThe \"contract year\" is always an alluring topic, but not all contract years are created equal. For instance, when established superstars like Chiefs DT Chris Jones and Buccaneers WR Mike Evans -- two Super Bowl champions with four Pro Bowl nods apiece -- entered this season in a walk year, everyone knew they'd eventually get PAID, one way or another. But not everyone came into this campaign with elite earning power. And those are the individuals I'd like to focus on today: The guys who've significantly raised their stock with spectacular play in the final year of their current deal.\n\nWith a few more weeks to put the finishing touches on the résumé, here are 10 players who have truly capitalized on a contract season, presented in alphabetical order.",

        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "We've reached a point in this NFL campaign where we safely can ask: How many great teams are there this season?\n\nThe 49ers and Ravens, the top two teams in my current pecking order, certainly qualify by 2023 standards. The next five on my list -- Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia, Kansas City and Detroit -- all have enjoyed moments of greatness mixed with patches of inconsistency, but I'll push them through.\n\nThings get a little dicey after that. But in the Year of the Backup QB, if there's a team outside the top seven that has the clear potential to join that top tier, it's certainly the Bills. Impressive back-to-back wins over the Chiefs and Cowboys have reminded everyone of what Buffalo's best football looks like, even if the 8-6 record naturally drags the team down. That said, the Bills' six losses were by a combined 26 points. Their eight wins were by 151 points.\n\nThe Bills now find themselves in the unusual situation of being higher in this week's Power Rankings (eighth) than they sit in the AFC playoff standings (ninth). That's a reflection of how well they're playing right now.\n\nThere's a chance they could miss the playoffs. But if the Bills do get in, they might be the most dangerous wild-card team since the 2020 Buccaneers, who won three road playoff games en route to a Super Bowl title.",

        "articleBody": "One of the main themes of HBO’s “Sopranos” is the trauma Tony Soprano’s parents inflicted on the main character during his childhood. Livia and Johnny Soprano certainly did a number on Tony.\n\nNow there’s a toy that will let you try to do a better job. Kind of.\n\nDebonairHeads, an independent artist and toy maker based out of Texas, has created a Tony Soprano Tamagotchi-like toy. A Tonygotchi. The digital handheld toy is shaped like everyone’s favorite New Jersey mob boss and allows you to raise a tiny Tony on the screen. The game allows you to at dinner with the family, feed Tony “gabagool” (capicola), go to the bathroom, hit the strip club, beat up a rival mobster and even go to therapy with Dr. Melfi.\n\nLong before iPhone games and Playstation 5s, Tamagotchis were among the most popular toys in the United States. Kids everywhere in the late 1990s and early 2000s had the little egg-shaped devices that allowed them to raise digital pets. While their popularity has faded, “Sopranos” is as popular as ever despite having been off the air for more than 16 years.\n\nThe bad news? A Tonygotchi will run you $750 dollars. The worse news? DebonairHeads made just five of them, and they already sold out.\n\nTo quote the man the game himself, what ya gonna do?\n\nStill, we’re happy this exists — we think?",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Much of the news in Congress this year had little to do with actual legislation, but lawmakers did manage to send 27 bills to President Biden's desk for a signature. That's a dramatic productivity decline relative to previous years, even when compared to other eras of divided government.\n\nBut they're set to start next year with a slew of legislation, if they can muster it. There are two government funding deadlines, Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, that they can solve by passing the 12 annual federal spending bills.\n\nThere are also ongoing negotiations about a foreign aid and immigration reform package, as Biden calls for military aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific and Republicans push for policy changes to stem the record tide of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWhile all of that percolates, here is a list of everything Congress did pass in 2023 — and what it accomplished.\nKeeping the government open and avoiding default\n\nOn June 3, Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, an agreement to raise the limit on the amount of money the U.S. government is allowed to borrow. It was a protracted fight between House Republicans and the White House.\n\nAs Republicans struggled to reach consensus on full-year government spending bills, Congress passed two short-term government funding measures: the Continuing Appropriations Act on September 30 and the Further Continuing Appropriations Act on November 16.\n\nThe next government funding deadlines are on January 19 and February 2, 2024.\nAddressing the needs of service members and veterans\n\nIn June, Congress passed a cost-of-living adjustment for veterans' disability payments (Veterans' COLA Act) and expanded the eligibility for a military academies' financial aid program (CADETS Act). In July, the authorized the construction of several new Veterans Affairs facilities (VA Major Medical Facility Authorization Act).\n\nThrough the fall, Congress expanded coverage and extended policies around various Veterans Affairs programs, including adding coverage for people with spina bifida who are the children of Vietnam veterans (Bills To Amend Title 38).\n\nAdditional legislation extends benefits eligibility to certain veterans who served in the South Korean army with U.S. troops in Vietnam (Korean American VALOR Act) and mandates an VA online records request portal (Wounded Warrior Access Act).\n\nThe National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act waived some means-testing requirements for some servicemembers and reservists seeking bankruptcy relief.\n\nCongress also named two VA clinics and commissioned a commemorative coin for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps.\nHealth, safety and COVID-19\n\nIn the spring, Congress formally ended the COVID-19 emergency declared by then-President Trump in March 2020 (Relating to a national emergency declared by the President). They also ordered the Director of National Intelligence to declassify all information relating to potential links between a Chinese research institute and the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19 Origin Act).\n\nThe TRANQ Research Act is intended to find ways to curb illicit use of the animal tranquilizer xylazine.\n\nTwo laws aim to improve U.S. air safety (NOTAM Improvement Act) and the organ transplant network (Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act), while another nullified a local Washington D.C. criminal justice reform law (Disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Revised Criminal Code Act).\nHunting education and reform\n\nSchools are now allowed to purchase \"dangerous weapons\" for the purposes of educational instruction or educational enrichment activities including archery and hunting under the Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act.\n\nThe Duck Stamp Modernization Act digitizes some aspects of the bureaucracy associated with federal hunting regulations.\n\nPotpourri\n\nThe Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act requires new federal rules to include links to summaries of the rules, which must be fewer than 100 words.\n\nAnother law, the Pala Band of Mission Indians Land Transfer Act, establishes a federal land trust for the Pala Band of Mission Indians in California.\n\nThe United States-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First Agreement Implementation Act, as you might guess, implements a trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan.\n\nA bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 extends the ability for federal elections regulators to fine campaigns for violating disclosure requirements for ten additional years.\n\nThe 5G SALE Act allows the government to vet applications for use of parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that were auctioned for use in March 2023.\nThe biggest headlines had nothing to do with legislation\n\nKevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was fired by his colleagues as Speaker of the House and ultimately chose to quit Congress.\n\nGeorge Santos, R-N.Y., was expelled by his colleagues after a series of lies about his background and 23 federal criminal charges related to fraud.\n\nSen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., has so far refused to resign after being accused by federal prosecutors of taking bribes in exchange for committing corrupt acts for committing corrupt acts, including providing sensitive information to the government of Egypt.\n\nHouse Republicans formalized their impeachment inquiry into President Biden, despite no direct evidence of wrongdoing. They could vote on articles of impeachment as soon as next month.\n\nFinally, aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan is held up over disagreements about immigration policy – negotiations are ongoing between a select group of Senators, but it is almost certain no deal can be inked until next year.",

        "articleBody": "For many, strolling around neighborhoods to look at the holiday light displays is an annual tradition that brings twinkling cheer.\n\nBut with the rise of LED lights in the last decade, some of the joy is lost. In its place, a slew of unintended consequences — from migraines and eye strain to nausea — have taken root. It can feel like the whole world was vibrating on and off.\n\nThe phenomenon has a name.\n\nFlicker\n\nFlicker is the catch-all term for changes in light output over time.\n\n\"One way to control the LEDs — and especially to dim LEDs — is to turn it on and off rapidly,\" says Naomi Miller, a lighting scientist and designer at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, who earned the nickname \"The Flicker Queen\" for her research on LEDs. \"And it's the fact that it's going from full on to full off for a chunk of time, that makes you see it as flicker.\"\n\nIn these lights, the electronics are everything. They determine how often the LED turns on and off.\n\nFor example, when dimming, the electronics might turn the LED on 50 percent of the time and off 50 percent of the time. \"And your eye will see that is being dimmed down to 50 percent,\" says Miller. \"However, some people may see that on-off operation as being distracting or disturbing.\"\n\nIt's unclear just how many people are bothered by flicker, but it's potentially a big problem because LED lights are the future. The U.S. government has been working for more than a decade to require more efficient light bulbs, and it culminated in a regulation earlier this year that in effect banned the sale of most incandescent light bulbs, because they are hugely inefficient.\n\nThis transition to LEDs is a big win for the environment.\n\"They use about a fifth of the energy that incandescents used to use,\" says Miller.\n\nThe Department of Energy predicts LED lights will cut carbon emissions by more than 200 million metric tons over the next 30 years. Not to mention help people save nearly $3 billion per year on their utility bills.\n\nAnd to be clear, LED technology has come a long way, and many LED lights have solved the flicker problem.\n\n\"We know that this doesn't occur for most LED products because most LED products have better quality electronics built into them that maintain the light output over time, and those products people don't object to,\" says Miller.\n\nBut for LED lights that do flicker, it can come in three forms.\n\nDirect Flicker\n\nDirect flicker (also known as low-frequency flicker) is when the viewer can observe the oscillation or jittering of the light source while looking directly at it. It happens when lighting modulates or changes between 3 and 80 times per second, or 3 and 80 Hertz.\n\n\"This one's an especially bad one,\" says Miller, pointing to the middle of three sets of holiday lights in her lab. They flicker on and off 60 times per second. \"It's producing this very jerky square waveform that is the kind of waveform that your brain was not designed to handle.\"\n\nFortunately, she notes that it's uncommon to use these lights in buildings. It's fortunate because, she says, \"there is a possibility that people who are affected by photosensitive epilepsy may actually have a poor reaction. So we really want to avoid this low frequency stuff.\"\n\nTiny strobe lights\n\nThe second form of flicker is the stroboscopic effect. Miller explains that it happens \"when you have a fixed gaze, but something is moving in the light that makes the uneven light output visible as jerky or unevenly-blurred motion.\" It can happen with lights ranging from 80 to 2000 Hertz.\n\nTo demonstrate, Miller points to a set of LED holiday lights that claim on the box to be flicker free. They are 120 Hertz, so their flicker isn't easily visible by just looking directly at them. But when she waves her finger back and forth in front of the lights, instead of seeing a smooth motion, it looks like little tracers of her finger are scattered in an arc.\n\nThe flicker of the LED lights make them work like super fast strobe lights, illuminating movement in such a way that it looks frozen in place.\n\nAnother way to identify the effect is to record the light source using a phone's slow motion setting and then watch the video. By slowing it down, the phone reveals that the lights strobe on and off rapidly, which is what makes movement like Miller's waving finger look jerky.\n\nThe ghost of lights past\n\nThe third form of flicker is called the \"phantom ray effect,\" or \"ghosting effect.\" It happens when your eyes are moving relative to a light source. The appearance of a repeating pattern — what looks like a zipper or string of lights — is created as the lit object is displaced spatially on the retina as the eyes scan.\n\nThis effect is particularly noticeable while driving at night behind cars with LED tail lights.\n\n\"Suddenly, as your eye moves around the roadway normally, you will see a repeating pattern of lights,\" says Miller. \"So you don't see one tail light anymore. You see a whole string of tail lights spaced at some distance apart.\"\n\nMiller says it can be unnerving because it makes it hard to see where the actual light on a moving car is.\n\nAdvice for avoiding flicker\n\nAs for how to identify which LED lights — not to mention phone screens — are prone to flicker, Miller suggests searching the Internet for flicker-related websites, or using your finger or phone to test for the stroboscopic effect.\n\nWhen purchasing, she recommends avoiding the cheapest bulbs, which she warns means being \"prepared for the fact that you may have to change out your dimmer because not all old dimmers work politely with the new LED technologies.\"\n\nFinally, Miller suggests taking any lights you don't like back to the store. \"The manufacturers need to know that people are unhappy with these products,\" she says. \"I still think it's going to be a subset of products. Even so, take them back.\"",

        "authors": "Tim Balk",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Gov. Hochul, who has often cast herself as a fierce ally of workers, has vetoed major labor legislation that would have banned noncompete agreements in New York State.\n\nThe legislation, passed by lawmakers in June, came as part of a national push to limit the use of noncompete pacts, which block employees from leaving their jobs to work at competing employers. The agreements are believed to depress wages; their defenders say they protect trade secrets.\n\nHochul, who had been caught in a tug-of-war between well-funded labor and business interests over the bill, sought changes to the ban in negotiations with lawmakers this month, fretting that such an expansive measure would hamper New York’s pandemic-challenged business sector.\n\nBut negotiations broke down Friday, a development previously reported by The Wall Street Journal. \n\nHochul had suggested only applying the ban to workers making up to $250,000 a year. Pro-labor interests had hoped Hochul would sign the bill without tweaks, or at least with a higher financial floor carved out for the exceptions to the ban. Negotiations between Hochul and lawmakers failed over whether to include bonuses in calculating the cap, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\n“I’m incredibly disappointed that our final offer was rejected,” Sean Ryan, the Buffalo Democrat who sponsored the bill in the state Senate, said in a Friday statement. “We put forward a compromise proposal to the Executive Chamber that would have ended the use of noncompetes for anyone with a base salary under $250,000, indexed that amount to inflation, and protected all health care workers from being subject to noncompete agreements.”\n\n“Sadly, this common sense offer was rejected,” Ryan added.\n\nIn a memo explaining her veto released by her office early Saturday, Hochul said some New York firms had “legitimate interests that cannot be met with the Legislation’s one-size-fits-all approach.” She said she was open to approving more narrowly tailored legislation in the future.\n\nHochul, a moderate Democrat, often touts her links to labor but has also taken pains to cultivate warm relations with Wall Street. Tens of thousands of dollars flowed to advertising campaigns on both sides of the noncompete issue.\n\nAnd the Federal Trade Commission, which has proposed a rule that would ban noncompetes nationwide, wrote to Hochul last month outlining the negative effect noncompetes have on workers: an estimated loss of at least $250 billion in worker pay a year in the U.S.\n\nHochul said she wished the FTC had already implemented some sort of ban — suggesting that the lack of a federal policy left her in a bind, not wanting to drive away business to the many states that lack bans.\n\nMinnesota banned noncompetes last spring, joining California, Oklahoma and North Dakota in a small club. A larger group of states has instituted rules against subjecting low-wage workers to noncompetes.\n\nCalifornia has had a ban on the measure since the 19th century. But the nation’s most-populous state was long an outlier.\n\nIn an extended reflection on the issue at a Manhattan news conference last month, Hochul said that giving middle- and low- income workers professional mobility was one of her “values” and “priorities.”\n\nAbout 44% of employers statewide subject some workers to noncompete agreements, and about 23% subject all workers to the agreements, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit.\n\nThere is a relatively broad consensus in New York politics that noncompete agreements are inappropriate for low-wage jobs. Noncompetes have proliferated in such jobs; the FTC said a third of American workers making under $40,000 a year have been shackled at some point by noncompete agreements.\n\nBut Kathy Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said a ban affecting high earners would create a mass departure of financial firms that use noncompetes to protect intellectual property and relationships.\n\nThe Partnership for New York City, a powerful business lobby, circulated a memo that suggested an amendment to the bill limiting the ban to workers earning under $250,000 per year.\n\nThe outcome was closely watched. A New York ban would have amounted to a national labor earthquake, according to employment lawyers.\n\nDavid Kappos, a former director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and an opponent of a blanket ban, said earlier this month that a ceiling on the ban would send a “very positive message that enables people like me to advise companies and their boards: ‘Yeah, invest in New York.’”\n\nRyan, the bill sponsor in the Senate, said that even a blanket ban was “pro-business,” arguing that noncompetes stifle entrepreneurship.\n\n“You’ll hear it from people in the tech industry: If they’re under a noncompete, and they’re not happy with their workplace, they often just get a job out of state,” Ryan said in an interview last month.\n\nBut in the end, the plan faltered.\n\n“I have to be cognizant of the fact that we have had an environment in this state for too long that has driven high-net-worth individuals and businesses out,” Hochul told reporters in November.",

        "articleBody": "Laura Lynch, a founding member of The Chicks — formerly The Dixie Chicks — has died in a car accident in Texas. She was 65.\n\nThe musician died following a highway collision outside of El Paso on Friday, her cousin, Mike Lynch, told TMZ.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety later confirmed Lynch’s death to the outlet. Their preliminary investigation shows she was heading east on a two-way portion of Highway 62 when another car heading west attempted to pass a third vehicle in front of it.\n\nLynch’s vehicle was hit head-on by the passing car. The driver of that vehicle was taken to a hospital. Their injuries are reported to be non-life-threatening. Lynch was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe upright bass player-turned-singer co-founded the Dallas-based country group in 1989, alongside Robyn Lynn Macy and sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer (nee Erwin). She left the group in 1995 following the release of three albums, but prior to the band hitting it big. She was then replaced by lead singer Natalie Maines.\n\n“We are shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of Laura Lynch, a founding member of The Chicks,” the band said in a statement on Instagram. “We hold a special place in our hearts for the time we spent playing music, laughing and traveling together. Laura was a bright light…her infectious energy and humor gave a spark to the early days of our band.”\n\nThe Chicks attributed the band’s success to Lynch’s “undeniable talents,” which they said “helped propel us beyond busking on street corners to stages all across Texas and the Midwest.\n\n“Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones at this sad time,” they concluded.\n\nThe name of the band reportedly stemmed from Lynch’s suggestion they refer to themselves as Dixie Chickens, she told Entertainment Tonight in the early 1990s. With the rest of the members hesitant “about being called chickens,” they ultimately settled on The Dixie Chicks.\n\nAt the time of publication, the surviving members of The Chicks have not individually commented on Lynch’s passing.\n\nLynch is survived by husband Mac Tull and the couple’s daughter.",

The TV I remember was a box that sat against a wall that we had to get up and go change the channel,” she told the outlet two months after her medical scare.\n\nDenicola was diagnosed with extensive amnesia, officially transient global amnesia or TGA, but doctors still can not determine the exact cause even after extensive tests and scans, according to the outlet.\n\nFive years after she suffered the migraine that changed her life, the nearly 60-year-old grandmother has still not recovered memories.\n\nDoctors are afraid she will never get her memory back.\n\n“They told me, if by now I haven’t gotten it, then I probably won’t,” she told outlet.\n\nTGA is a “temporary, anterograde amnesia with an acute onset” that mostly affects individuals middle-aged and older, according to the National Library of Medicine, with 5.2-10 people of 10,000 suffering annually with the number rising to 23.5-32/100,000 individuals over the age of 50.\n\nIt often occurs during periods of “particularly strenuous activity, high-stress events, or coitus, but it can be seen with migraines.”\n\nThe memory condition is often a temporary event and can reoccur, but death is very rare.\n\nDenicola has been reading journal entries in a bid to remember her life but says it feels like reading about someone else.\n\nDenicola has rekindled her love for her husband and watched her children grow up through her stories and pictures.",

Truett Cathy.\n\n“This is war,” Graham posted to X in response to an article about the bill. “If this goes forward, I will be introducing legislation withholding federal funds from any city or state that requires @ChickfilA to stay open on Sunday.”\n\n“The founders of Chick-fil-A made a decision early on to close on Sunday, consistent with their faith. For any government to try to reverse this decision flies in the face of who we are as Americans. Chick-fil-A is a great company with thousands of locations serving the public with a quality product and taking care of their employees. New York is off base and their actions will not go unanswered,” Graham added.\n\nThe New York State Assembly bill filed last week would require Chick-fil-A, and other food vendors, operating at rest stops owned by the State Thruway Authority to be open seven days a week.\n\nThe fast-food chain was called out by name in the justification section of the proposed law. \n\n“While there is nothing objectionable about a fast food restaurant closing on a particular day of the week, service areas dedicated to travelers is an inappropriate location for such a restaurant.

        "authors": "Wendee Wendt",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "Here's why a Cardinal might fly into your life (and if that's a good thing).\n\nWidespread and abundant, the cherry red birds called Cardinals can be spotted throughout the United States and as far north as southeastern Canada. They are often observed adding a touch of color to anyone's day, as they stop for a snack every now and then at bird feeders. It's no wonder the Cardinal is an obvious favorite among casual observers and bird watchers, as it is listed as the official state bird for at least seven eastern states.\n\nBut a Cardinal isn't just another pretty little bird. They have been viewed as a sign of hope and a reminder that you can do hard things, because hard things do not last forever. And many believe that the Cardinal's spiritual meaning is a good omen—even indicating that someone is trying to get your attention.\n\nLet's get into this further with animal communicator Ruthy Doolittle. \n\nWhat Does It Mean When You See a Cardinal?\n\nCardinal sightings have a multitude of meanings such as being a sign of hope, wisdom or blessings, or that they are angels with a divine message for you.\n\nAccording to Doolittle, Cardinals are a symbol of change. \"It can mean a huge shift coming in your life which can sometimes be viewed as an ending,\" she explains.\n\nBut an ending isn't necessarily a bad thing. As Doolittle continues, \"[If] one of those appears, new opportunities will present themselves...you are being asked to trust in this process.\"\n\nSo, just like the old saying goes, \"As one door closes, another one opens.\"\n\nIs It a Good Omen To See a Cardinal?\n\nBesides Blue Jays and Owls being good omens to see, it is also a good omen to see a Cardinal. Seeing one may be signaling you to ask yourself if you are feeling safe and secure.\n\nDoolittle tells Parade, \"The deep crimson chest of a Cardinal connects with the red of the root chakra, as your consciousness rises, as you become more aware of the shifts and changes in your life to stay grounded in your body.\"\n\nIf you are feeling kind of off-kilter, grounding activities like walking barefoot on the grass or meditating will help you get your footing.\n\nWhat Does It Mean Spiritually When You See a Cardinal?\n\nIt is quite possible that if you are noticing Cardinals, then someone from the spirit world is trying to reach you.\n\nIf Cardinals are popping into your life often, especially if you do not normally see them, then it is vital that you take notice because, as claimed by Doolittle, \"You are being divinely guided at this time.\"\n\nDoolittle's take is one way to look at what happens when this bird visits you, but what does it mean when God sends us a Cardinal?\n\nThere is no direct language in the Bible referencing the Cardinal. However, to some, the Cardinal's vibrant color represents the blood of Jesus. Therefore, a visit from the crimson beauty is viewed as a direct message from God Himself.\nWhat Do Red Cardinals Symbolize?\n\nAgain, Cardinals can symbolize many things. However, Doolittle tells us, \"Change and transformation is coming.\"\n\nAnd just like the bold red color of the Cardinal, a person should be \"bold and truthful in expressing [themselves].\"\n\nBy paying attention to what is going on around you and in your life, a person can use those signs to move forward in life positively. \"Your body is your greatest intuitive tool, if you only will listen to it,\" Doolittle explains.\n\n2 Red Cardinals: Spiritual Meaning\n\nLife gets quite interesting when you are being visited by two red Cardinals. The spiritual meaning behind seeing two of them is that you should take a closer look at your relationships.\n\n\"Two has a highly intuitive meaning, it is the most relationship-focused number,\" Doolittle explains.\n\nShe says that seeing the two Cardinals \"encourages us to allow this creative and powerful energy force that we all have available to us, and highlights that we can have peace and balance in any situation.\"\n\nIf you are having troubles or struggles with any current relationship, don't give up, especially if two Cardinals appear to you. They could very well be signaling to you that balance and peace are on the horizon.\n\nMeaning of Red Cardinal at the Window\n\nIt is common to look out at your feeder and see the occasional Cardinal, but have you ever looked out just to have one peeking back at you?\n\nIt could be a little startling to see a bird at your window looking directly at you, but the meaning of it is quite special.\n\nDoolittle says that if you have a red Cardinal looking in the window at you, you are being \"called to look inside of you for the messages and insights you wish to receive at this time.\"\n\nBy grounding yourself through breathing practices or meditation, it is possible to still yourself long enough to use your own energy as an extra layer of protection from the outside world.\n\nAll you have to do, says Doolittle, is \"to tap into your own energy and create boundaries around your energy and [towards those] who have access to the sanctuary of your heart and your home.\"\n\nIt should be noted that it is important to notice if the Cardinal at your window is looking inside at you or away from you.\n\nIf, by chance, the bird is looking away from you, then Doolittle believes that the red Cardinal has messages for you, but \"you may be missing [them] by being too busy or too distracted from your spiritual self.\"\n\nThe biggest takeaway from a Cardinal visit is that no matter what you believe, whether it is a message from a Higher Power, or that you have a deceased family member sending you messages, slow down.",

        "articleBody": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — More than 20,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza during Israel’s war against Hamas, health officials said Friday, the latest indication of the staggering cost of the conflict as Israel expands its ground offensive and orders tens of thousands more people to leave their homes.\nThe deaths amount to nearly 1% of the territory’s prewar population.\n\nThe 11-week conflict has displaced nearly 85% of Gaza’s people and leveled wide swaths of the tiny coastal enclave. And more than half a million people in Gaza — a quarter of the population — are starving, according to a report Thursday from the United Nations and other agencies.\n\nIsrael has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is removed from power in Gaza and all the hostages taken during its Oct. 7 cross-border attack are freed.\n\nDespite the humanitarian emergency, a U.N. Security Council vote on aid deliveries and terms for a cease-fire was delayed again late Thursday, after days of high-level negotiations.\n\nThe United States, which has veto power, has pushed back against calls for an immediate cease-fire and giving the U.N. sole responsibility for inspecting aid deliveries. Israel, citing security grounds, insists it needs to be able to screen goods entering Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. said it would back a revised resolution that calls for “creating the conditions” for a cease-fire, rather than an immediate end to fighting.\n\nOther countries support a stronger text and said diplomats would need to consult their governments before a vote, which is expected Friday.\n\nMartin Griffiths, the U.N. humanitarian affairs chief, lamented the world’s inaction.\n\n“That such a brutal conflict has been allowed to continue and for this long — despite the widespread condemnation, the physical and mental toll and the massive destruction — is an indelible stain on our collective conscience,” he wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nSRAEL VOWS TO KEEP UP PRESSURE ON HAMAS\n\nIsrael, shielded by the United States, has resisted international pressure to scale back its offensive and has said it would press on until Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years, has been destroyed.\n\nThe military has said that months of fighting lie ahead in southern Gaza, an area packed with the vast majority of the enclave’s 2.3 million people, many of whom were ordered to flee combat in the north earlier in the war.\n\nSince then, evacuation orders have pushed displaced civilians into ever-smaller areas of the south as troops focus on the city of Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest.\n\nThe military said late Thursday that it is sending more ground forces, including combat engineers, to Khan Younis to target Hamas militants above ground and in tunnels. On Friday, it ordered tens of thousands of residents to leave their homes in Burej, an urban refugee camp, and surrounding communities, also in the south.\n\nIn the city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, an airstrike on a house killed six people, according to Associated Press journalists who saw the bodies at a hospital. Among the dead were a blind man, his wife and their 4-month-old child, said the infant’s grandfather, Anwar Dhair.\nRafah is one of the few places in Gaza not under evacuation orders, but has been targeted in Israeli strikes almost every day.\n\nThe air and ground campaign also continued in the north, even as Israel says it is in the final stages of clearing out Hamas militants there.\n\nMustafa Abu Taha, a Palestinian farm worker, said many areas of his hard-hit Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah have become inaccessible because of massive destruction from airstrikes.\n\n“They are hitting anything moving,” he said of Israeli forces.\nRISING DEATH TOLL AND HUNGER\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said Friday that it has documented 20,057 deaths in the fighting and more than 50,000 wounded. It does not differentiate between combatant and civilian deaths. It has previously said that roughly two-thirds of the dead were women or minors.\n\nIsrael blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll during its intense air and ground campaign, citing the group’s use of crowded residential areas for military purposes.\n\nIsrael declared war after Hamas militants stormed across its border and killed some 1,200 people and kidnapped 240 others. Israel’s military says 139 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, including about 2,000 in the past three weeks, but it has not presented any evidence to back up the claim.\n\nMeanwhile, phone and internet services were gradually being restored late Thursday, after the latest communications blackout of 35 hours.\n\nRepeated cuts in communications have hampered aid deliveries, which cover only a fraction of the unprecedented humanitarian needs in Gaza.\n\nThe hunger eclipsed even the near-famines of recent years in Afghanistan and Yemen, according to Thursday’s report, which warned that the risk of famine is “increasing each day,” blaming the hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza.\n\nAn Israeli liaison officer with Gaza claimed there is no food shortage in Gaza, saying sufficient aid is getting through.\n\n“The reserves in Gaza Strip are sufficient for the near term,” Col. Moshe Tetro, a defense official, said from the Kerem Shalom cargo crossing, opened by Israel several days ago amid international demands to improve the flow of aid. Tetro did not elaborate.\n\nThe war has also pushed Gaza’s health sector into collapse.\n\nOnly nine of its 36 health facilities are still partially functioning, all located in the south, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe agency reported soaring rates of diseases in Gaza, including a five-fold rise in diarrhea and increases in cases of meningitis, skin rashes and scabies.",

        "authors": "Kerry Brunskill",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "All of these games from the '80s, '90s and 2000s have aged like fine wine.\n\nI don't own an uncomfortably expensive gaming machine just so I can thoughtlessly crank almost every graphics setting in new games to ultra and then bask in the glow of their raytraced glory. I mean, I do do that, but I also can clog up my SSD with decades worth of incredible classics too, and then switch between crushing this year's hottest RPG and casually clicking my way around something very, very, old, with a few taps of a mouse button.\n\nI've got pretty much all of gaming history at my fingertips, and the best part is I'm completely free to spend as much or as little time as I want with all of them. There's no FOMO with games I already MO'd on a decade or more ago, nobody is eagerly awaiting my hot take on some plot twist 30 hours into an RPG that lit up the charts in 2001, and most of them are so cheap the prices are almost offensive—I've paid more for snacks than I have some undisputed all-time legends when they're on sale. Even at 2023's idea of full price these old games don't cost much more than pocket change.\n\nRetro PC gaming is a non-stop party, and it only gets bigger every year. Below are some of the very best of the '80s, '90s and '00s I played this year, all available to download on Steam or GOG with no fussy setup.\n\nBack to basics: Mushihimesama (2004)\nSpace Invaders never went out of fashion, it just evolved. Thanks to Taito's legendary shmup gamers of a certain age have an almost primal need to shoot things coming from the top of the screen using the thing at the bottom, and for my money there's not much on PC that can do it as well as Cave's insect-filled Mushihimesama.\n\nIt's visually fresh. I love making spaceships explode as much as anyone, but there's something a bit special about flying over pastel-hued vegetation while doing it, or seeing a familiar turret-style bullet-spewer reimagined as a giant beetle bursting out of the sand. It's got more depth than some strategy games, too: Scoring well becomes a complex points-boosting dance that could take months of practice.\n\nThe game's only bettered by its sequel, Mushihimesama Futari, which still hasn't been ported to PCs (or any other modern format) and yes I will stay mad about it until some kind publisher finally fixes this horrific error. \n\nAlternatively: Touhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism (2008)\n\nYou never forget your first Touhou shmup, and this one was mine. Much like every other game in the series, it's filled with fairies, the sorts of characters that launch a thousand pieces of fanart, and gigantic laser beams—as any great game should be. \n\nArcade stick workout: Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle (1989 - 1997)\n\nCome for Final Fight's familiar Mad Gear gang whacking, stay for Battle Circuit's aggressive pink flamingo and madcap sci-fi setting. This collection, spanning seven games released from the late '80s to early '90s, may not be the biggest one Capcom's ever given us, but the highly curated selection gives it a strong theme and a laser-like focus the larger \"anything goes\" collections lack. This consistency makes it much easier to dip in and out of each game without breaking the mood. You know what you're in for with this bundle—and that's improvised weaponry, some sort of floor-delivered foodstuffs, and a damned good time.\n\nIt's easy to have a good time with friends too, as thanks to their arcade roots these games were always designed with seamless drop in/drop out co-op play in mind, and don't expect anyone to read a manual (to read anything, really) before getting stuck in. Just set up your sticks and play.\n\nAlternatively: Samurai Shodown NeoGeo Collection (1993-2004)\n\nOne of the greatest series the NeoGeo—maybe the entire fighting genre—has ever produced, conveniently brought together in one glorious package. Every game is beautiful, atmospheric, and unique, with a restrained approach to blood splatter and limb dismemberment that shocks in ways Mortal Kombat's crude globs of gore and puddles of red can only dream of.\n\nBring out the graph paper: Eye of the Beholder (1991)\n\nI revisited this as a sort of warm-up for Baldur's Gate 3—obviously they don't play much like each other, but I felt I needed something to help get me back into the spirit of flinging Melf's Acid Arrow at hordes of goblins again. What I soon ended up doing was playing EotB purely for the pleasure of stomping around Waterdeep's sewer system one more time. This dungeon crawler's still an essential experience even today, the real-time nature of the monster-wandering through its depths making every step into the unknown feel dangerous even before I've accidentally set off any traps.\n\nAlternatively: Xanadu Next (2005)\n\nFalcom's game offers a very different sort of dungeon crawling, but it's no less enthralling for it. This brilliantly atmospheric adventure—one old enough to have had an official N-Gage release—confidently takes its time to unfurl from a simple village hub into a compelling and complex epic. \n\nFive more minutes: Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (1999)\n\nAs far as I'm concerned a PC's not a PC until this strategy game's set up somewhere in my games folder. Broadly speaking it's not unfair to call this \"Civ in Space,\" although to leave the description there would do this timeless experience a huge disservice. There's a sentient planet to deal with for starters, as well as the fragmented remains of humanity to form fast friendships and fragile allegiances with too. Whether dealing with enemy sabotage, reminding a cocky rival exactly who has the most powerful forces on the planet, or just quietly managing a (briefly) stable society, Alpha Centauri is one of those games where every \"quick go\" somehow becomes another all-nighter. \n\nAlternatively: X-COM: UFO Defense (1994)\n\nI seem to enjoy games best when they're infused with a lingering sense of dread, and X-COM has that by the UFOful. The most helpful advice I can offer is this: Dying a lot is a feature, not a personal failing. It'll happen a lot. A lot. And a lot of those \"a lots\" will be your own fault. Embrace death, because it's coming whether you're ready or not. \n\nHelp, I've only got five minutes: Pinball Illusions (1995)\n\nSometimes I don't want a game to consume my every last thought until 3am. Sometimes I'd just like to spend five whole minutes having some fun with a game that didn't mind if my tired brain could in that moment be outwitted by pocket lint. And what's better than good old pinball for that?\n\nI'd recommend playing the Vikings table first—great theme, impeccably pulled off, lots of fun details—before spending a little time with the futuristic Law 'n' Justice: which is definitely not inspired by the hit '80s manga Appleseed. Briareos? Who? Just ignore the cyborg in the centre of the table, that could be anyone.\n\nAlternatively: Pinball Fantasies (1994)\n\nThere is no such thing as too much pinball, especially when GOG helpfully includes the game in the same \"Pinball Gold Pack\" as Illusions. Partyland and Stones 'n' Bones are my personal favourites, although every table's worth spending your five free minutes with.",

        "authors": "Len Hafer",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "Building doomed cities and loving it. \n\nThe basic idea baked into a city builder is that I'm creating something to last. Every street, every house, every decoration is placed with care to craft cozy neighborhoods and shopping areas where people will live and thrive, theoretically forever. So when Against the Storm presented me with the premise that each of my handmade habitats would be wiped away by a terrible tempest as part of an unavoidable, cataclysmic cycle, I wasn't sure how to feel about it. But what has revealed itself in the puddles left over when the clouds clear is one of the most clever, engaging, and endearing strategy games I've played in years.\n\nIn the world of Against the Storm, some kind of horrifying, magical disaster has turned the once-idyllic fantasy countryside into a rain-soaked, ruin-strewn morass in which everything outside of the magically-shielded capital, The Smoldering City, is annihilated by hurricane-force gales every year. As the Queen's viceroy, your job is to set out during the brief windows during which the land is traversable to found productive settlements that will take you closer to a set of mysterious seals. By completing these seals, you will permanently lengthen the storm cycle and draw closer to understanding what happened.\n\nEach new settlement site comes with a varied set of possible positive and negative modifiers, which could be anything from a ghostly presence that randomly kills unhoused villagers to a creepy species of tree that also gives you meat, in addition to wood. I'm sure it's fine. While keeping the central hearth fire lit at all costs, you send your intrepid humans, beavers, lizards, and other anthropomorphized animals out to chop through the woods and discover new glades while collecting resources to build houses, workshops, and decorations.\n\nWhile the strong silhouettes and low polygon count of its models, buildings, and trees can evoke a bright, fairy tale wonderland, the dangers that lurk between the branches are more like the original Brothers Grimm stories. It's not a completely bleak game, but it can be very challenging to manage its competing pressures. Central to everything are two meters measuring the Queen's grace and her impatience. Filling the grace meter first signals that you have essentially won the map, and can set out from this foothold to reach further into the gloom and start another. But maxing out her impatience means the expedition is deemed a failure and recalled, and the time you've spent there won't get you any closer to a seal.\n\nImpatience simply rises over time, but grace can only be earned by completing semi-randomized missions and keeping your villagers happy. Everyone needs food and a house. But each of Against the Storm's races also has more specific desires as you move up Maslowe's hierarchy. This doesn't only create an interesting balancing act, but also adds a delightful bit of personality to each race. Beavers, for instance, are fancy little lads who love tea parties and a good vintage of wine. They're also quite hard to please. Lizards, on the other hand, delight in munching on beef jerky and engaging in recreational combat. It's rare to be able to please all of the species in your settlement, so you usually have to choose which ones to favor. But the more pampered any one group gets, the harder they become to satisfy over time.\n\nDownpour\n\nFulfilling these needs becomes an engaging resource puzzle, especially since the blueprints you receive for workshops and industrial buildings are also semi-randomized. Everyone loves pie and biscuits, but if you simply don't have a mill to make flour this run, you're completely out of luck in the baked goods department. Some things can be obtained in limited quantities from roaming traders, but it's impossible to ever fall into a comfortable routine due to not knowing which resources and which buildings will be available. Against the Storm is always challenging me to adapt, and I really enjoy that.\n\nAt the same time, cutting deeper into the woods—which is required to keep fuel in the hearth, find food, and complete objectives—increases the hostility of the forest. This looming air of wilderness menace, which freaks everyone out a bit, also goes up passively the longer you spend in one place, which makes it harder to keep everyone safe and satisfied. Even cutting your way into a new glade increases hostility by a little bit, so there's an additional tension related to how fast you want to expand. It seems like all of these layered considerations would become overwhelming, but in motion they fit together beautifully and prompt you to constantly be making interesting, meaningful decisions.\n\nEven when I'm not able to land on my feet, I'm rewarded for my time in some small way. The Smoldering City offers a towering long-term progression tree in which you use resources gained from each expedition, win or lose, to unlock benefits from small percentage increases to stats like villager speed, to new blueprints that can completely change how you set up an economy. This small amount of incremental progress, assuring me that my next expedition will always be just a bit better equipped than my last, has been a great motivation to keep going even if I hit a bit of a slump. And I also love the fact that certain blueprints can eventually be added to your permanent starting kit at the higher levels. Roguelikes that simply add more cards to the deck of things you can draw often feel lackluster in the progression department, and this is a compromise that resolves the issue nicely.\n\nI've already poured dozens of hours into Against the Storm and reforged the Bronze Seal, the first of six. And I barely feel like I'm getting started, having unlocked about a quarter of the Smoldering City's upgrades. Rainpunk mechanics that let you harness the storm to industrialize your production, higher difficulties that feature something of a fire department mechanic, and tougher seals that can be best described as multi-stage boss fights, still await me. And I'm thrilled every time to pull on my boots and get out into it again. This isn't just a great city builder. It's really something special.",

        "articleBody": "Don't let criminals fool you into giving up vital personal information during your job search. We show you seven ways to spot potential scam artists.\n\nWidespread layoffs rocked the tech industry throughout 2023 affecting workers everywhere, from Amazon's gaming divisions to VPN companies. Searching for a job at any time can be stressful, and feeling a financial pinch during the holidays can make the situation seem dire. This creates the perfect setting for online scammers to snag new victims.\n\nThe very nature of job seeking makes people vulnerable to identity theft schemes. You already give up all kinds of information about yourself to strangers before reaching the in-person interview stage. On top of that, desperation can cause people to do drastic things with disastrous consequences, such as giving money to a stranger for more information about a new job or entering their social security number and financial account information on unsecured web forms.\nHow to Avoid Job Search Scams\n\nAccording to the FBI, scammers also take advantage of people who apply for jobs by creating fake job postings to phish for personal information. The scammers then use the data they collect to commit identity fraud.\n\nThe FBI offers seven tips to help job seekers avoid phishing scams:\n\n1. Research the Employer Online Before Applying\n\nDoes the company exist? Does the recruiter or hiring manager work for that company? Is the company hiring for this job? Verify this information on the company's website. Does the job posting link to a secure web address that starts with https://? Hover your mouse over the link to reveal the true URL. \n\n2. Verify Postings Found on Networking and Job Sites\n\nIf you found the job posting on a third-party job board such as indeed.com or LinkedIn, check whether that job is listed on the company’s website. Not every employer hosts a page with job postings, but many do. If you don't see a position listed there that you saw elsewhere, take it as a red flag and continue looking for others.\n\n3. Don't Provide Bank Account Information Until You're Hired\n\nScammers may ask for money or bank account information during the interview. A legitimate employer won't ask for your banking details until you've signed a contract and are setting up direct deposit. Even then, they'll ask to verify only the bank name, account number, and routing number or SWIFT code—but never your online banking username and password.\n\n4. Confirm the Employer's Identity\n\nDo not accept a job solely through email, over the phone, or via a chat app. Insist on an in-person interview or video call.\n\n5. Never Send Money to Anyone You Meet Online, Especially Via Wire Transfer\n\nAgain, scammers may try to get you to pay for supposed training fees or background checks. A legitimate company or employer will not make these kinds of requests.\n\n6. Don't Share Personal Data With Job Search Apps or Networking Sites\n\nDo not enter your Social Security number or other personal identification information into online web forms on third-party job search sites. Save that for the HR department or hiring manager of the prospective company.\n\n7. If You Must Enter Your Social Security Number, Make Sure the Site Is Secure\n\nCheck the web address for \"https://\" Only enter your information after you’ve been in contact with a human in person or via video call.",

According to Amazon reviews, the quality of the brush rolls are truly top-notch, which really makes a difference when grabbing debris.\n\nThe iRobot Roomba 694 offers customized schedules and is capable of cleaning both carpets and hardwood floors. The Patented Dirt Detect Technology even helps guide the vacuum to the messier areas of your humble abode. It also comes equipped with a bunch of advanced sensors, which allows the vacuum to navigate around obstacles and avoid stairwells. There’s nothing more hair raising than a robot vacuum flying down the stairs (trust me on this one). It even works with your voice via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n\nThis is a really deal, but we’d recommend you not dawdle, as the holidays are fast approaching. Get it now before it’s too late.",

        "articleBody": "Shore up your defenses, stat. \n\nLet’s just start by saying that you should definitely be using a password manager. Data breaches are happening more frequently, and that flood of stolen info has made cracking passwords even easier. And it’s not just the “password12345” variety that is at risk—passwords that use variations on a single password or substituting numbers for letters are also vulnerable. Even if you’re using unique, random passwords, storing them in a document or spreadsheet is not truly keeping them safe and secure.\n\nWhile paid password managers offer nice extras, a free password manager still protects you from the risks of using weak passwords (or worse, using the same one everywhere). Instead of remembering all of your passwords, you just have to remember one password to access a single, secure place where all of the rest are stored.\n\nAnd because free password managers come in different flavors and styles, you should be able to find one that fits your needs. Even Google’s password manager, built into Chrome and Android, can soon double as a no-cost option after receiving some killer upgrades recently. Plus, if you find that the free versions aren’t enough, down the road you can always upgrade to a paid service as your needs grow.\n\nNot sure what features you’ll need? Generally, you want a service that offers password generation, autoform filling, two-factor authentication, and the ability to move between different devices -and- device types. For more info, you can read our explanation of what you need to know about password managers.\n\nBitwarden – Best free password manager for most people \n\n\nLike several other services, Bitwarden offers a free tier and a paid tier—but its free tier packs in so many features that most individuals won’t need more. You can access the service across an unlimited amount of devices and a multitude of device types, enable basic TOTP two-factor authentication, and fill your vault with as many passwords as you’d like. The free personal plan also allows privacy-minded users to avoid the company’s cloud hosting and instead self-host. And in recent months, Bitwarden has added security features that let you generate random user names and email aliases (via integration with email masking services) in addition to random passwords.\n\nRivals dole out far less to their free users, and it’s particularly rare for them to grant unrestricted movement between multiple device types. (LastPass and Dashlane begin charging as soon as you want to leave the confines of a single device.) Most competitors are also not open-source like Bitwarden, which prevents their communities from being able to hunt for hidden backdoors or security holes.\n\nThe free personal plan even now includes real-time password sharing with one other account—perfect for couples or people otherwise closely linked. This feature allows unlimited password sharing between the two users, thus allowing both individuals to safely access current passwords for shared accounts.\n\nBitwarden’s other advantage is that should your needs expand down the road, the transition to a paid plan won’t cost much. A premium personal plan is just $10 per year (compared to $36-plus per year for rivals), and a family plan is $40 per year for up to six users (compared to $48-plus per year for rivals). And moving up to a paid tier does come with concrete benefits: support for more sophisticated forms of two-factor authentication, evaluations of your passwords’ health (e.g., strength, public exposure, etc.), encrypted file storage, and emergency access for trusted individuals.\n\nFinally, if you decide to move elsewhere one day, Bitwarden allows you to export your passwords—with the option to do so as an encrypted file. But with such a generous and thorough set of features, you’ll likely not want to go elsewhere.\n\nKeePass – Best free password manager for DIYers \n\n\nKeePass may not look like much, as our review points out, but under the hood this desktop-application-based password manager has all the features the privacy- and security-minded could want, provided you don’t mind rolling up your sleeves a bit.\n\nYou return full control over who accesses your password vault—the program and its encrypted database file(s) are stored locally on your computer by default, unlike a cloud service, where you have to trust that servers are set up correctly and that the employees are trustworthy. Moreover, you don’t even have to install it on your system, but can run it via a portable .exe application kept on a USB stick.\n\nKeePass is also an open-source program, which means that the community can always vet it for any hidden backdoors or just plain old security-crippling bugs. And you can enable two-factor authentication through the use of key files (which augments your master password), plus lock the database file to the Windows account that created it, too.\n\nYou’re not restricted to a Windows desktop system, either—because the program is open source, you can find community-created ports of KeePass for MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, as well as a boatload of plugins that let you customize it to your taste. With plugins, you can re-create most of the features you’d find in paid cloud-based services, like checking to see if any of your passwords have been found as part of a data dump.\n\nYou can also get creative with how you store your database file—for remote access, you can put it on a home server, or if you’re comfortable, a cloud service of your own choosing. (Perhaps you’re more comfortable with how Google safeguards its accounts than a dedicated password manager service, for example.) And should you ever decide to hang up your hat as a DIY password manager administrator, KeePass allows for easy exports of your passwords.\n\nKeePassXC – Best free password manager for easy offline use \n\n\nSo an online password manager makes you nervous. Or you instead prefer to have 100 percent control over your passwords. You could use KeePass, but that program can be…a little intense.\n\nA great middle ground is KeePassXC, a streamlined alternative of the official KeePass app. It boasts a more modern interface, and is much more newbie-friendly. It also has a few features you’d expect from an online manager, like a browser extension.\n\nDespite its simplified interface, you’ll still find many of KeePass’s best attributes in KeePassXC. It’s equally open source and free, for starters. Its file format is also the same as KeePass (and generally visa versa), so switching between the two programs is easy. You can download it for Windows, Linux, or macOS as well. And the app stores its encrypted database files on your device by default, so you have full control over your passwords. You can keep them offline, or upload to the cloud if you wish.\n\nUsing KeePassXC is a cinch. It’s hard to get overwhelmed by it—you can only create one type of entry in a database: Just logins, and you only get five fields to fill out within each entry. Set up of two-factor TOTP tokens, attaching files, and adding custom text fields is also supported, but that’s it. And unlike the official KeePass app, KeePassXC doesn’t support plugins.\n\nYou will still need to apply a little elbow grease to get the most of this app—for example, password sharing isn’t enabled out of the box. But good documentation makes light work of configuring the app. Generally, with KeePassXC, what you see is what you get, and that’s exactly the appeal of this offline password manager. Even leaving it (by exporting all your passwords) is an easily found option in the menu.\n\nBest free password manager for simplicity: Google, Apple, or Firefox\n\n\n    Website: Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, Firefox Password Manager\n    Devices: Varies\n    Open source: No\n    Two-factor authentication (2FA): Yes\n\nPassword managers within mobile operating systems and major browsers have come a long way. Just a few years ago, we wouldn’t have advised using them at all, but now they’ve shored up their security and features to become a viable (though basic) option.\n\nBut basic isn’t bad—when it comes to password managers, the best service is the one that you’ll use. For some people, using a dedicated password manager can be too much to keep track of. In those cases, leaning on Google, Apple, or even Firefox can help upgrade your password security with little extra effort necessary. Their built-in password management tools can do the heavy lifting of creating and remembering unique random passwords across the web, and you won’t need to switch to a different app to make it work.\n\nOf course, you will lock yourself into those ecosystems by doing so, but if you live your whole life within those waters already, you won’t be bothered by that fact. Google probably will appeal to most people, as Chrome is ubiquitous, but those who worry about data privacy can instead turn to Firefox and its pledge to not sell your data. Apple also shares Firefox’s commitment to privacy, but it’s the hardest platform to leave, as the company doesn’t provide an easy method to export passwords. We advise choosing Google or Firefox for the widest reach across devices, and Apple if you own both MacOS and iOS devices (and don’t plan to leave). Microsoft’s password manager in Edge can also be worth a look for people deeply enmeshed in the Windows ecosystem.\n\n    Committing to Apple and iCloud Keychain? Follow these tips on how to set it up and make the most of it.\n\nThe one primary downside to using your Google, Apple, or Firefox account to store passwords is that they’re not as tightly safeguarded as with a third-party service. Even if you secure your account with two-factor authentication (and you absolutely should if you’re storing passwords in it!), Google, Apple, or Firefox tend to be more lax about accessing passwords from a device that’s logged in. Often they don’t ask for reauthentication to use a stored password, unlike most dedicated password managers—and that can be a security hazard on a shared device.\nFree vs. paid password managers\n\nWhy bother with a paid password manager if you can use a free one? Paid services provide premium features that enable more control over your passwords and how you secure them. For example, you’ll often gain access to password sharing (handy if your household members all need to know the Netflix password), support for YubiKey and other more “advanced” forms of 2FA authenticators, and alerts that tell you if your password turned up in a data dump. Some paid services even have a signature feature that makes them stand out from competitors—for example, 1Password has a “travel vault” feature that hides some passwords when you’re traveling, as an extra security measure when you might encounter aggressive airport screening or simply lose access to your devices due to theft or lost baggage.\n\nIf you need these kinds of features, check out our list of the best paid password managers to see which ones offer the best bang for your buck.",

        "articleBody": "Suren Seetal, 36, was reported missing after he didn't return home from work on Nov. 2\n\n A Florida airplane mechanic who was trying to collect a $315,000 debt was kidnapped and killed — and one of the suspects is the man who owed him the money, authorities allege.\n\nOn Monday, the United States Attorney’s Office announced charges against three men who authorities allege had “involvement in a violent kidnapping and murder of Miami-Dade resident Suren Seetal.”\n\nA federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida charged Broward County residents Somjeet Christopher “Lil Chris” Singh, 29, Avin “Smalls” Seetaram, 24, and Gavin Hunter, 18, with murder for hire conspiracy, murder for hire, kidnapping conspiracy, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. \n\nSingh allegedly owed the Seetal approximately $315,000, and Seetal's girlfriend told authorities he'd been trying to collect his debts, according to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe 36-year-old victim was last seen alive on Nov. 2 as he was leaving work. However, once he failed to return phone calls and did not come home, his family reported him missing. \n\n“Suren was last working at the airplane hangar at Banyan, FXE Airport in Fort Lauderdale, and left around 6:41 p.m. Thursday November 2nd, 2023 to run some errands before his trip to Trinidad on Saturday,” Karen Seetal, an organizer on a GoFundMe account, shared on Nov. 13. \n\n “Suren did not return home Thursday night nor did he show up for work on Friday. His cell phone has been going to voicemail. Any donations will go directly to the family to help with the search. Thank you for any help you can provide,” the fundraiser continued. \n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Suren Seetal's cell phone was allegedly traced near Dr. HVAC, Singh’s air conditioning company. The device went off network a short time later. \n\nHis body was recovered at Big Cypress Reservation on Nov. 21.\n\nThe affidavit alleges that Seetal knew Singh and Seetaram from working together in the fireworks business. The suspects had been communicating with each other up until Seetal's cell phone’s signal was cut on Nov. 2. \n\n Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.\n\nAdditionally, the affidavit alleged that the following morning, an unmarked black tow truck driven by an employee of Singh's cousin removed Seetal's vehicle from the vicinity of Dr. HVAC. \n\nThe move was allegedly tracked by SunPass, a toll system in Florida. \n\nThe same day that Seetal's vehicle was towed, Home Depot security footage allegedly picked up Seetaram and Singh purchasing a 96-gallon yard waste cart, according to the affidavit.\n\nSeetaram's cell phone also allegedly pinged traveling in the direction of where the victim’s body was discovered. Hunter is believed to be the suspect who fatally shot Seetal, the affidavit alleges.\n\n\"We extend our sincere condolences to the Seetal family. It's still very early, but I have been in regular communication with the Government since my client's arrest, and working diligently with the Government to understand the allegations and reach a just and expeditious resolution to this serious matter,\" Seetaram’s attorney said, in part, in a statement obtained by NBC 6.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Seetaram will have an arraignment hearing on Dec. 28.\n\nHunter’s arraignment hearing is scheduled for Jan. 2. Singh’s arraignment hearing is scheduled for Jan. 3.\n\nPEOPLE was not able to contact attorneys for any of the suspects, and it's not immediately clear if any of the suspects has entered a plea.\n\nIf convicted of the charges contained in the federal indictment, Seetaram, Singh, and Hunter will each face a mandatory sentence of life in prison or the death penalty, the press release states.",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "The Biden administration is doing more to counter North Korean hackers amid concerns their cryptocurrency heists are powering the country’s weapons programs. \n\nThe Biden administration has spent much of the last two years bracing key U.S. networks and infrastructure against crippling cyberattacks from Russia, Iran and China.\n\nBut it is following a different playbook as it ramps up its efforts to thwart digital threats from North Korea: Follow the crypto — and stop it.\n\nConvinced North Korea primarily sees hacking as a way to funnel money back to the cash-strapped Kim Jong Un regime, the White House has focused on blocking the country’s ability to launder the cryptocurrency it steals through its cyberattacks.\n\nIn the last year, the administration has unveiled a flurry of sanctions against North Korean hacking groups, front companies and IT workers, and blacklisted multiple cryptocurrency services they use to launder stolen funds. Earlier this month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced a new partnership with Japan and South Korea aimed at cracking down on Pyongyang’s crypto bonanza — thereby choking off money to its nuclear and conventional weapons programs.\n\n“In countering North Korean cyber operations, our first priority has been focusing on their crypto heists,” Anne Neuberger, the National Security Council’s top cybersecurity official, said in an interview.\n\nThe stepped-up effort to blunt North Korea’s cyber operations is fueled by growing alarm about where the fruits of those attacks are going, Neuberger said.\n\nHacking, she argued, has enabled North Korea to “either evade sanctions or evade the steps the international community has taken to target their weapons proliferation … their missile regime, and the growth in the number of launches we’ve seen.”\n\nPoor regulation and shoddy security in the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry, which is dominated by start-ups, make it an easy target for Pyongyang’s hackers. Because of crypto’s inbuilt privacy features and the fact that it can be sent across borders at the click of a mousepad, it also offers a powerful tool to circumvent sanctions.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted roughly 100 ballistic missile tests in the last year, and it staged its first intercontinental ballistic missile test in five months on Monday. Between November and August, it also exported more than a million artillery shells to Russia, according to South Korean intelligence services.\n\nU.S. officials increasingly believe the key to slowing that type of activity lies at the intersection of hacking and cryptocurrency.\n\nLast year, Pyongyang-linked hackers stole roughly $1.7 billion worth of digital money, according to estimates from cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis.\n\nAnd in May, Neuberger estimated that about half of North Korea’s missile program is funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft.\n\nNorth Korean hackers “directly fund” North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, said State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel.\n\nUntil recently, North Korea’s cyber prowess has garnered relatively little attention in Washington. Fear of digital strikes spilling over from the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, or during a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan, has overshadowed the issue, experts say.\n\n“People tend to think, … how could the quote-unquote ‘Hermit Kingdom’ possibly be a serious player from a cyber perspective?” Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said in an interview. “But the reality couldn’t be further from the truth.”\n\nPyongyang’s hackers have repeatedly caught Western companies off-guard with their technical ingenuity, an ability to blend old-fashioned spy tricks with cyber operations and sheer brazenness, according to private sector researchers.\n\nAnd while those who study North Korean cyber operations say their proficiency at stealing cryptocurrency represents a major challenge to the West today, they also argue it would be dangerous to pigeonhole Pyongyang as little more than a money-stealing threat.\n\nBy some metrics, North Korea has launched more than a dozen supply-chain attacks in the last year — a sophisticated tactic in which hackers compromise the software delivery pipeline to get nearly unfettered access to a wide range of companies.\n\nThe significance of those attacks has been “extremely underplayed in the public,” said Tom Hegel, a threat researcher at cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, because they caused little harm outside the direct victims of the attacks — often individuals or obscure cryptocurrency startups.\n\nBut some of the same techniques they’ve honed in targeting those firms could have been used to cause widespread digital disruption, say cybersecurity experts.\n\nIn April, researchers at cybersecurity firm Mandiant uncovered that North Korean hackers had pulled off the first publicly known instance of a “double” software supply-chain hack — jumping from one software maker into a second and from there to the company’s customers.\n\nMandiant assessed the hackers were after cryptocurrency. Had they wanted to, however, the North Koreans could have used tactics like that to inflict “a massive level of damage,” said SentinelOne’s Hegel.\n\nWhat North Korea “is able to do on a global scale, no one has replicated,” added Mick Baccio, global security adviser at security firm Splunk.\n\nAsked about her level of concern that North Korean hackers had grown more capable and could pivot to destructive activity, Neuberger acknowledged Pyongyang’s hackers are “capable, creative and aggressive.”\n\nBut she said the White House was confident the North Koreans are focused on stealing money or intellectual property that could be used for the country’s weapons programs. She also argued that cutting off the profitability of North Korea’s hacks is one of the best ways to deter them.\n\n“The goal is to aggressively cut the profitability of the regime’s hacking,” she said.\n\nNorth Korea’s proficiency in computer warfare has surprised onlookers for almost a decade now.\n\nThey famously burst onto the public consciousness in 2014, when Pyongyang’s operatives hacked into Sony Pictures Entertainment and threatened the movie studio against releasing “The Interview,” a raunchy comedy that portrayed the assassination of Kim Jong Un. Years later, in 2017, they unleashed a self-spreading computer virus that is estimated to have caused billions of dollars in damages in a matter of hours.\n\nBut in addition to the growing technical proficiency of North Korean hackers, it is the volume and variety of their activity that has recently alarmed onlookers.\n\nIn the last 18 months, U.S. intelligence agencies have warned that Pyongyang is targeting think tanks and academics to collect intelligence and staging ransomware attacks — in which they scramble victims’ data until they pay an extortion fee — against U.S. healthcare companies.\n\nMore recently, the Justice Department, FBI and Treasury Department have also accused Pyongyang of dispatching thousands of tech workers to Russia and China, where they secured remote IT jobs with global companies under a false identity, and then funneled their salaries back to the regime.\n\nIn one recent case that received little attention outside the region, North Korean hackers conspired with insiders at a South Korean data recovery company to bilk millions from unwitting victims of Pyongyang’s attacks.\n\nJust a fraction of that money appears to have found its way back to Pyongyang, according to South Korean law enforcement. But the scheme dated back to 2017 and involved a variant of ransomware that was not previously linked to Pyongyang.\n\nThe case speaks to how creative the country has gotten at finding ways to avoid scrutiny and skirt international sanctions, said Erin Plante, vice president of investigations at Chainalysis.\n\n“It shows that they’re always thinking outside the box, evolving and keeping up with the news in the same way we do, which is a little bit scary,” she said.\n\nMichael Barnhart, a North Korea expert at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said the scheme was reminiscent of several other operations the country’s hacking forces have pulled off in recent memory — some of which are not yet public.\n\nThe common theme, he argued, was how adept Pyongyang has become at mixing cyber operations with more traditional spying and money laundering tactics.\n\n“This is a very, very well-organized criminal family,” he said.",

        "title": "How Biden allies learned to love the Fed — or, at least, dread it less",
        "authors": "Adam Cancryn",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "A soft landing appears to be here. And maybe some rate cuts are on the way. What’s not to love?\n\nPresident Joe Biden has a matter of months to convince gloomy voters that he’s built a thriving economy. Democrats now think he’ll get a hand in doing so from an unlikely source: the Federal Reserve.\n\nBiden allies who spent the last year fearful that the Fed’s effort to curb inflation would tip the nation into recession have suddenly changed their tune with the central bank on the verge of pulling off a so-called soft landing.\n\nThe rate-hiking campaign that ballooned people’s borrowing costs and weighed on economic forecasts appears over, without major damage to the job market in its wake. And after a brief pause, Fed officials are indicating they may reverse course and start actually cutting interest rates. They got another green light signal on Friday when the Commerce Department reported that inflation grew by just 1.9 percent over the last six months, putting it under the 2 percent yearly level that the Fed has long made its target. Biden, in a statement, called it “a significant milestone.”\n\n\n\nThat shift, he and other Democrats hope, will serve as a definitive signal to voters that the economy has emerged from a sea of challenges far stronger than before — just as the presidential race hits full stride.\n\n“Lowering the interest rates would be huge,” said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster for Biden’s 2020 campaign, calling it a key element in making Americans more optimistic about the future. “What’s important for voters is not so much the absolute level of the economy, but the direction of the economy.”\n\nThe White House has no plans to break its long-standing silence on the Fed, much less demand that Chair Jerome Powell take specific actions — an approach that marks a sharp departure from former President Donald Trump’s practice of routinely pressuring the bank’s policymakers.\n\nBut the mere act of feeling anticipation, rather than dread, for the Fed’s next moves represents a newfound sensation for much of the Democratic Party. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s 21-month bid to rein in soaring inflation involved 11 rate hikes, pushing the bank’s benchmark interest rate to its highest point in more than two decades.\n\nThe aggressive push frustrated leading Democrats who were concerned it would derail the economic recovery that Biden had orchestrated to that point. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led open rebukes of the Fed earlier this year, with Warren accusing Powell of putting millions of jobs at risk.\n\n\n\nAnd though the White House has maintained a strict policy against commenting on the Fed, some Biden aides — convinced inflation was being driven largely by lingering supply chain problems — privately worried that the bank was misreading the moment.\n\nThe U.S. nevertheless averted a recession, buoyed by continued job growth and a surge in Americans’ willingness to spend.\n\n“The soft landing has happened. We’re there, we’ve landed, our feet are on the ground,” said Seth Harris, the former deputy director of Biden’s National Economic Council. “The question is, how long before people start feeling that?”\n\nThe gap between the macroeconomic news that the White House has begun openly embracing and the lagging public sentiment about the state of the economy is now the predominant concern facing the administration. With prices still elevated, polls consistently show voters mired in a sour economic mood.\n\nThe White House has spent recent weeks emphasizing specific areas where prices are now coming down. But the Fed, Harris and others argue, can play its own broadly influential role in bolstering voters’ view of the economy as on the upswing. The central bank could choose to lower rates as soon as early 2024, and with inflation nearing the Fed’s target, some Wall Street analysts project three separate cuts throughout the year.\n\n“There’s a lot of ongoing bitterness about the extent of past inflation, but in terms of current conditions, I think the highest interest rates in a generation are one of the last things that really shout abnormal to a lot of voters,” said Tobin Marcus, a former economic adviser to then-Vice President Biden and current head of politics and policy at Wolfe Research. “I do think that bringing those down could have a fairly significant effect.”\n\nThere are varying views on when and by how much the Fed might begin cutting rates, even among those officials charged with the decision-making. But already there are early indications that the Fed’s shifting stance may be reverberating through the economy.\n\n\n\nThe stock market rallied to new highs over the past month, as it became clearer Powell’s rate-hike drive was nearing an end. Consumer confidence in December hit its highest point since the summer, according to the Conference Board’s latest reading. More concretely, mortgage interest rates have dipped, a move that’s made home buying somewhat more affordable.\n\nAnd critically for Biden officials who bristled over the monthslong predictions of a recession, the Fed’s fresh talk of easing rates has driven a change in the conversation among the economic experts who play an outsized role in shaping perceptions of the economy.\n\n“I think it will slowly start to dawn a little bit more on people who convey the news about how the economy’s doing,” said Mike Konczal, the director of macroeconomic analysis at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank. “We’ve gone from determining who gets blamed to determining who gets credit.”\n\nThere’s still some trepidation over whether a soft landing will prove to be the turning point in how voters view the Biden economy. The president remains well underwater when it comes to his handling of the economy, and there’s little guarantee conditions will all keep trending in the right direction.\n\nThe labor market could abruptly falter, robbing Biden of one of his strongest selling points. Inflation has not yet reached the Fed’s target rate of 2 percent, meaning any setback could prompt the central bank to abandon all talk of rate cuts. And there’s the perpetual political hurdle the White House faces of ensuring that Biden and his policies get credit for any shift in voter attitudes toward the economy.\n\n“What I fear is that everyone is going to credit the Fed with the soft landing,” said Harris. “When rates went up, employment did not go through the floor, and I really want folks to focus on the fact that the economy now is different because of fiscal policy that Biden and Democrats drove through — not merely because of monetary policy.”\n\n\n\nTop Biden officials have taken a series of year-end victory laps to that effect, touting the administration’s work to unsnarl supply chains and pass sweeping investments in climate and infrastructure that, they say, juiced the economic recovery.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Biden is betting that he can win over skeptical voters with a two-pronged strategy that both emphasizes his accomplishments and details all the popular policies that Trump is likely to roll back if he’s returned to office.\n\n“Republicans are against so many critical actions that help working and middle-class people,” Biden said during a Wednesday speech in Wisconsin. “These are the same Republicans that enacted tax cuts to overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy to the tune of a $2 trillion additional deficit.”\n\nBiden officials have expressed confidence those tactics will begin to pay off in 2024 as more voters tune into the presidential race. But there’s hope among Democrats that lower rates might give voters a boost in the meantime that, in turn, brightens Biden’s political prospects — and turns the Fed from a source of frustration into a well-timed friend.\n\n“A lot of the tenor of next year will be, we got through the reopening, we got through a lot of tough stuff,” Konczal said. “If you can’t convince people things are good, you can at least tell them the bad things are increasingly in the rearview mirror.”",

        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "This article is part of POLITICO’s Global Policy Lab: Living Cities, a collaborative journalism project exploring the future of cities. Sign up here.\n\nBRUSSELS — For years Brussels has lagged behind other European cities when it comes to quality of life.\n\nWhile Paris, Vienna and Barcelona transformed their urban landscapes with new parks, sustainable housing projects and green superblock neighborhoods, Brussels maintained a somewhat unpolished image with its car-choked streets and concrete-heavy public spaces.\n\nBut the city now hopes to shed that image with a radical new urban scheme known as \"Good Living.\" The city-building plan would make wider sidewalks, greener public spaces and sustainable buildings the norm across the Belgian capital, while prohibiting demolitions and progressively slashing on-street parking.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Brussels Secretary of State for Urbanism Ans Persoons, who oversees the scheme, said it would ensure \"quality of life, quality of public space [is] at the center of every project that is carried out in the city.\"\n\nBut getting the new rules approved won't be easy.\n\nThe region's left-leaning coalition government has less than six months left in its mandate and will need to overcome several legislative hurdles to lock in Good Living before elections in June.\n\nThe scheme also risks facing heavy blowback, given it touches on how people live, move and build new homes in the city. Many residents — car-users in particular — are still fuming over the government's Good Move mobility plan aimed at keeping cars out of the city center.\n\nIf approved on time, the new rules could inflame social tensions just before people head to the polls.\n\nReclaiming the city\n\nThe Good Living plan aims to completely rewrite the capital's city-building regulations, which date back to 2007 and are \"totally outdated,\" according to Persoons.\n\nBack then, \"Brussels was very different demographically and we hadn't dealt with things like the pandemic or extreme heat, issues we have to deal with today,\" she explained.\n\nOne of the signature proposals would see the width of sidewalks expanded from 1.2 meters — or less — to a minimum of 2 meters, creating space for more comfortable movement and allowing people with disabilities and parents with strollers to access the city more easily.\n\nThe plan also addresses climate change with new minimum requirements for trees and green spaces: At least 5 percent of narrow streets must be reserved for greenery, while wider thoroughfares have to set aside at least 15 percent of their surface for vegetation.\n\nThese measures means there will be less space for on-street parking — a dramatic prospect in a city that has seen violent protests held in reaction to the Good Move scheme to reduce traffic within the capital.\n\nDespite the potential for backlash, Persoons said rethinking how roads and public spaces are used is a key part of the plan.\n\n\"Protecting the city from heat and extreme weather involves planting more trees and having more green space to absorb rainwater,\" she said, and rethinking urban movement \"requires us to account not just for private cars, but also for public transport, cyclists and pedestrians.\"\n\nThe secretary of state added that she isn't interested in \"waging a war on cars,\" but rather in ensuring that \"everyone has their space.\"\nNew rules for new buildings\n\nThe Good Living plan also aims to transform Brusseleirs' homes.\n\nThe scheme would make it extremely difficult to tear down buildings — a process Persoons said is \"terrible for the environment and comes at a huge energetic cost.\" Instead, developers will be obliged to look for ways to renovate or convert existing structures.\n\nNew buildings will have to be designed in a way that ensures they can be transformed from commercial to residential spaces if needed. And in a nod to safety concerns within the city, ground floors of buildings must have clear windows on the street-level to ensure there are fewer blind spots.\n\nThe plan requires flats in new residential buildings to have terraces of at least 2 square meters in size, and for every additional bedroom, the size of that terrace will have to be increased by an additional 2 square meters.\n\nMeanwhile, the roofs of new buildings will have to provide more than just shelter: The spaces must either help retain rainwater, accommodate solar panels or be used as a terrace.\n\nWhile most of the new regulations target new builds, the plan would also see the permitting processes for existing housing streamlined or eliminated altogether with the goal of making energy-efficient renovations less cumbersome. That's something the city hopes will make it easier to meet upcoming EU rules that aim to dramatically improve the energy performance of buildings.\n\nThe Brussels region is currently on track to see the Good Living plan approved by June — but the process could be thrown off course by Belgium's Council of State, which is tasked with checking new legislation has been developed correctly.\n\nIf the body were to find the city did not carry out enough public consultations, for example, the scheme would not be approved before the June elections, Persoons conceded. There's no telling if Brussels' next government would take the plan forward or shelve it.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we'll make it,\" said Persoons. \"These changes are needed to meet new EU requirements, but they're also needed to reinforce our right to enjoy good quality of life in the city ... Making the city greener, more inclusive, more accessible for everyone is something that benefits us all.\"",

        "articleBody": "Kremlin’s cash grab could leave German and Austrian firms out of pocket. \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed decrees granting his government power to confiscate and forcibly sell off billions of dollars worth of assets belonging to European energy firms to new state-approved owners.\n\nIn a decree published Wednesday, the Kremlin mandated the creation of new Russian-run companies to take over shares in the colossal Yuzhno-Russkoye oil and gas field, currently owned by Austria's OMV and Germany's Wintershall. The two European energy giants, both from countries that Moscow claims are \"unfriendly\" in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, together hold a 60 percent stake in the drilling site in Russia's icy far north.\n\nWhile the companies will theoretically be compensated for their investment, the amount they receive from the sale will be determined by the Russian state, in a move that marks the biggest asset seizure in the country's recent history.\n\nEarlier this year, the Kremlin laid out a legal framework for the expropriation of foreign-owned assets as it seeks to shore up its economy in the face of Western sanctions. Following the decision, former Russian oil and gas tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who had his own energy empire dismantled and was jailed as a result of his opposition to Putin, told POLITICO there were now no legal protections for foreign firms.\n\n“There are no guarantees for the safety of investments anywhere, but Vladimir Putin’s regime has demonstratively built an illegitimate and lawless state,” he said at the time.\n\nMany Western energy firms have announced their total withdrawal from Russia since the start of the war in February 2022, including the U.S.'s Exxon Mobil and Norway's Equinor. However, others such as Shell, BP, TotalEnergies and Wintershall have found the practicalities of wrapping up their business in the country and clawing back their funds challenging.\n\nExperts warn that a lack of Western investment, coupled with embargoes on key hardware and technologies for oil and gas exploration and drilling, mean Russia's flagship fossil fuels sector is likely to face a long-term decline in productivity, despite sanctions loopholes and high prices for oil and gas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has already confiscated assets belonging to Western firms like Danone and Carlsberg in the wake of their decisions to leave the market, handing the windfall to close allies of Putin and their families.",

        "authors": "Madison Czopek,  Katie Sanders ",
        "date": "2023-12-21",
        "articleBody": "As pundits and politicos spar over whether Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign will factor into the outcome of the 2024 election, one thing is clear:\n\nKennedy’s political following is built on a movement that seeks to legitimize conspiracy theories.\n\nHis claims decrying vaccines have roiled scientists and medical experts and stoked anger over whether his work harms children. He has made suggestions about the cause of COVID-19 that he acknowledges sound racist and antisemitic.\n\nBolstered by his famous name and family’s legacy, his campaign of conspiracy theories has gained an electoral and financial foothold. He is running as an independent — having abandoned his pursuit of the Democratic Party nomination — and raised more than $15 million. A political action committee pledged to spend between $10 million and $15 million to get his name on the ballot in 10 states. \n\nEven though he spent the past two decades as a prominent leader of the anti-vaccine movement, Kennedy rejects a blanket \"anti-vax\" label that he told Fox News in July makes him \"look crazy, like a conspiracy theorist.\"\n\nBut Kennedy draws bogus conclusions from scientific work. He employs \"circumstantial evidence\" as if it is proof. In TV, podcast and political appearances for his campaign in 2023, Kennedy steadfastly maintained:\n\n    Vaccines cause autism.\n\n    No childhood vaccines \"have ever been tested in a safety study pre-licensing.\"\n\n    There is \"tremendous circumstantial evidence\" that psychiatric drugs cause mass shootings, and the National Institutes of Health refuses to research the link out of deference to pharmaceutical companies.\n\n    Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were discredited as COVID-19 treatments so COVID-19 vaccines could be granted emergency use authorization, a win for Big Pharma. \n\n    Exposure to the pesticide atrazine contributes to gender dysphoria in children.\n\n    COVID-19 is \"targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.\"\n\nFor Kennedy, the conspiracies aren’t limited to public health. He claims \"members of the CIA\" were involved in the assassination of his uncle, John F. Kennedy. He doesn’t \"believe that (Sirhan) Sirhan’s bullets ever hit my father,\" Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y. He insists the 2004 presidential election was stolen from Democratic candidate John Kerry.\n\nNews organizations, including PolitiFact, have documented why those claims, and many others, are false, speculative or conspiracy-minded.\n\nKennedy has sat for numerous interviews and dismissed the critics, not with the grievance and bluster of former President Donald Trump, but with a calm demeanor. He amplifies the alleged plot and repeats dubious scientific evidence and historical detail. \n\nWill his approach translate to votes? According to polls since November of a three-way matchup between President Joe Biden, Trump and Kennedy, Kennedy pulled 16% to 22% of respondents.\n\nKennedy’s movement exemplifies the resonance of conspiratorial views. Misinformers with organized efforts are rewarded with money and loyalty. But that doesn’t make the claims true.\n\nHow an environmental fighter took up vaccines\n\nKennedy, the third of 11 children, was 9 when he was picked up Nov. 22, 1963, from the Sidwell Friends school in Washington, D.C., because Lee Harvey Oswald had shot and killed Uncle Jack. He was 14 when he learned that his father was shot by Sirhan Sirhan following a victory speech after the California Democratic presidential primary.\n\nRFK Jr., who turns 70 in January, wouldn’t begin to publicly doubt the government’s findings about the assassinations until later in his adulthood. \n\nAs a teenager, he used drugs. He was expelled from two boarding schools and arrested at 16 for marijuana possession. None of that slowed an elite path through higher education, including Harvard University for his bachelor’s degree and the University of Virginia for his law degree.\n\nHe was hired as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan in 1982, but failed the bar exam and resigned the next year. Two months later, he was arrested for heroin possession after falling ill on a flight. His guilty plea involved a drug treatment program, a year of probation and volunteer work with a local fishermen’s association that patrolled the Hudson River for evidence of pollution that could lead to lawsuits.\n\nKennedy’s involvement with Hudson Riverkeeper and the National Resources Defense Council ushered in a long chapter of environmental litigation and advocacy.\n\nAn outdoorsman and falconer, Kennedy sued companies and government agencies over pollution in the Hudson River and New York watershed. (He joined the New York bar in 1985.) He earned a master’s degree in environmental law at Pace University, where he started a law clinic to primarily assist Riverkeeper’s legal work. He helped negotiate a 1997 agreement that protected upstate New York reservoirs supplying New York City’s drinking water. \n\nIn 1999, Kennedy founded the Waterkeeper Alliance, an international group of local river and bay-keeper organizations that act as their \"community’s coast guard,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2016. He stayed with the group until 2020, when he left \"to devote himself, full time, to other issues.\"\n\nOn Joe Rogan’s podcast in June, Kennedy said that virtually all of his litigation involved \"some scientific controversy. And so, I'm comfortable with reading science and I know how to read it critically.\"\n\nPolitiFact did not receive a response from Kennedy’s campaign for this story.\n\nHe became concerned about mercury pollution from coal-burning power plants; methylmercury can build up in fish, posing a risk to humans and wildlife. As he traveled around the country, he said women started appearing in the front rows of his mercury lectures. \n\n\"They would say to me in kind of a respectful but vaguely scolding way, ‘If you're really interested in mercury contamination exposure to children, you need to look at the vaccines,’\" Kennedy told Rogan, whose show averages 11 million listeners per episode.\n\nKennedy said the women sounded \"rational\" as they explained a link between their children’s autism and vaccines. \"They weren’t excitable,\" he said. \"And they had done their research, and I was like, ‘I should be listening to these people, even if they’re wrong.’\"\n\nHe did more than listen. In June 2005, Rolling Stone and Salon co-published Kennedy’s article \"Deadly Immunity.\" Kennedy told an alarming story about a study that revealed a mercury-based additive once used in vaccines, thimerosal, \"may have caused autism in thousands of kids.\" Kennedy alleged that preeminent health agencies — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the World Health Organization — had colluded with vaccine manufacturers \"to conceal the data.\"\n\nKennedy’s premise was decried as inaccurate and missing context. He left out the ultimate conclusion of the 2003 study, by Thomas Verstraeten, which said \"no consistent significant associations were found between (thimerosal-containing vaccines) and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\"\n\nKennedy didn’t clearly state that, as a precaution, thimerosal was not being used in childhood vaccines when his article was published. He also misrepresented the comments of health agency leaders at a June 2000 meeting, pulling certain portions of a 286-page transcript that appeared to support Kennedy’s collusion narrative. \n\nScientists who have studied thimerosal have found no evidence that the additive, used to prevent germ growth, causes harm, according to a CDC FAQ page about thimerosal. Unlike the mercury in some fish, CDC says, thimerosal \"doesn’t stay in the body, and is unlikely to make us sick.\" Continued research has not established a link between thimerosal and autism.\n\nBy the end of July 2005, Kennedy’s Salon article had been appended with five correction notes. In 2011, Salon retracted the article. It disappeared from Rolling Stone.\n\nSalon’s retraction was part of a broader conspiracy of caving \"under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry,\" Kennedy told Rogan. The then-Salon editor rejected this, saying they \"caved to pressure from the incontrovertible truth and our journalistic consciences.\"\n\nKennedy has not wavered in his belief: \"Well, I do believe that autism does come from vaccines,\" he told Fox News’ Jesse Watters in July.\n\nDavid Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, interviewed Kennedy for a July story. Noting that Kennedy was focusing more on vaccine testing rather than outright opposition, Remnick asked him whether he was having second thoughts.\n\n\"I’ve read the science on autism and I can tell you, if you want to know,\" Kennedy said. \"David, you’ve got to answer this question: If it didn’t come from the vaccines, then where is it coming from?\"\n\nHow COVID-19 helped RFK Jr.’s vaccine-skeptical crusade\n\nIn 2016, Kennedy launched the World Mercury Project to address mercury in fish, medicines and vaccines. In 2018, he created Children’s Health Defense, a legal advocacy group that works \"aggressively to eliminate harmful exposures,\" its website says. \n\nSince at least 2019, Children’s Health Defense has supported and filed lawsuits challenging vaccination requirements, mask mandates and social media companies’ misinformation policies (including a related lawsuit against Facebook and The Poynter Institute, which owns PolitiFact). \n\nFrom the beginning, the group has solicited stories about children \"injured\" by environmental toxins or vaccines. This year, it launched a national bus tour to collect testimonials. The organization also produces documentary-style films and books, including Kennedy’s \"The Wuhan Cover-Up and the Terrifying Bioweapons Arms Race\" and \"The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health.\" \n\nIn 2020, Children’s Health Defense and the anti-vaccine movement turned attention to the emerging public health crisis.\n\nKolina Koltai, a senior researcher at Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group, had seen anti-vaccine groups try to seize on Zika and Ebola outbreaks, with little success. But the COVID-19 pandemic provided \"the exact scenario\" needed to create mass dissent: widespread fear and an information vacuum. \n\nChildren’s Health Defense published articles in March and April 2020 claiming the \"viral terror\" was an attempt to enact the \"global immunization agenda\" and a \"dream come true\" for dictators. The group echoed these points in ads and social media posts and grew its audience, including in Europe.\n\nOn Twitter, Children’s Health Defense outperformed news outlets that met NewsGuard’s criteria for trustworthiness from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021, according to a report by the German Marshall Fund think tank, even as Children’s Health Defense published debunked information about COVID-19 and vaccines.\n\nIn 2019, Children’s Health Defense reported it had $2.94 million in revenue, and paid Kennedy a $255,000 salary. Its revenue grew 440% through 2021, according to IRS filings, hitting $15.99 million. Kennedy’s salary increased to $497,013. (Its 2022 Form 990 for tax disclosure is not yet public. Kennedy has been on leave from the organization since he entered the presidential race in April.)\n\nOn social media, the message had limits. Meta removed Kennedy’s personal Instagram account in February 2021 for spreading false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, the company said, but left his Facebook account active. A year and a half later, Meta banned Children’s Health Defense’s main Facebook and Instagram accounts for \"repeatedly\" violating its medical misinformation policies. Several state chapters still have accounts.\n\nAs the group’s face, Kennedy became a leader of a collective movement opposed to masks and stay-at-home orders, said Dr. David H. Gorski, managing editor of Science-Based Medicine and a professor of surgery and oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine. \n\n\"The pandemic produced a new generation of anti-vaxxers who had either not been prominent before or who were not really anti-vax before,\" Gorski said. \"But none of them had the same cultural cachet that comes with being a Kennedy that RFK Jr. has.\" \n\nRallying a crowd before the Lincoln Memorial on Jan. 23, 2022, Kennedy protested COVID-19 countermeasures alongside commentator Lara Logan and anti-vaccine activist Dr. Robert Malone. The crowd held signs reading \"Nuremberg Trials 2.0\" and \"free choice, no masks, no tests, no vax.\" When Kennedy took the stage, mention of his role with Children’s Health Defense prompted an exuberant cheer.\n\nIn his speech, Kennedy invoked the Holocaust to denounce the \"turnkey totalitarianism\" of a society that requires vaccinations to travel, uses digital currency and 5G and is monitored by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates’ satellites: \"Even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did.\" \n\nDays later, facing criticism from his wife, the actor Cheryl Hines, Jewish advocacy groups and Holocaust memorial organizations, Kennedy issued a rare apology for his comments. \n\nAsked about his wife’s comment on Dec. 15 on CNN, he said his remarks were taken out of context, but he had to apologize because of his family.\n\nRecycle. Repeat. Repeat. \n\nWhen he’s asked about his views, Kennedy calmly searches his rhetorical laboratory for recycled talking points, selective research findings, the impression of voluminous valid studies, speculation, and inarguable authority from his experience. He refers to institutions, researchers and reports, by name, in quick succession, shifting points before interviewers can note what was misleading or cherry-picked. \n\nThere is power in repetition. Take his persistent claim that vaccines are not safety tested.\n\n    In July, he told \"Fox & Friends,\" \"Vaccines are the only medical product that is not safety tested prior to licensure.\"  \n\n    On Nov. 7 on \"PBS NewsHour,\" Kennedy said vaccines are \"the only medical product or medical device that is allowed to get a license without engaging in safety tests.\"\n\n    On Dec. 15, he told CNN’s Kasie Hunt that no childhood vaccines have \"ever been tested in a safety study pre-licensing.\"\n\nThis is false. Vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines, are tested for safety and effectiveness before they are licensed. Researchers gather initial safety data and information about side effects during phase one clinical trials on groups of 20 to 100 people. If no safety concerns are identified, subsequent phases rely on studies of larger numbers of volunteers to evaluate a vaccine’s effectiveness and monitor side effects. \n\nKennedy sometimes says that some vaccines weren’t tested against inactive injections or placebos. That has an element of truth: If using a placebo would disadvantage or potentially endanger a patient, researchers might test new vaccines against older versions with known side effects. \n\nBut vaccines are among \"the most tested and vetted\" pharmaceutical products given to children, said Patricia Stinchfield, a pediatric nurse practitioner and the president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nKennedy encourages parents to research questions on their own, because doctors and other experts are invariably compromised. \n\n\"They are taking as gospel what the CDC tells them,\" Kennedy said on Bari Weiss’ \"Honestly\" podcast in June. \n\nPublic health agencies have been \"serving the mercantile interests of the pharmaceutical companies, and you cannot believe anything that they say,\" Kennedy said.\n\nExperts fret that the Kennedy name carries weight.\n\n\"When he steps forward and he says the government’s lying to you, the FDA is lying to you, the CDC is lying to you, he has credence, because he’s seen as someone who is a product of the government,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s infectious diseases division and the director of the Vaccine Education Center. \"He’s like a whistleblower in that sense. He’s been behind the scenes, so he knows what it looks like, and he’s telling you that you’re being lied to.\" \n\nKennedy name-drops studies that don’t support his commentary. When speaking with Rogan, Kennedy encouraged the podcaster’s staff to show a particular 2010 study that found that exposure to the herbicide atrazine caused some male frogs to develop female sex organs and become infertile. \n\nKennedy has repeatedly invoked that frog study to support his position that \"we should all be looking at\" atrazine and its impact on human beings. The researcher behind the study told PolitiFact in June that Kennedy’s atrazine claims were \"speculation\" given the vast differences between humans and amphibians. No scientific studies in humans link atrazine exposure to gender dysphoria.\n\nIn July, Kennedy floated the idea that COVID-19 could have been \"ethnically targeted\" to \"attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.\" The claim was ridiculously wrong, but Kennedy insisted that it was backed by a July 2020 study by Chinese researchers. That study didn’t find that Chinese people were less affected by the virus. It said one of the virus’s receptors seemed to be absent in the Amish and in Ashkenazi Jews and theorized that genetic factors might increase COVID-19 severity.  \n\nFive months later, Kennedy invoked the study and insisted he was right: \"I can understand why people were disturbed by those remarks. They certainly weren't antisemitic. ... I was talking about a true study, an NIH-funded study.\" \n\n\"I wish I hadn’t said them, but, you know, what I said was true.\"\n\nKennedy answered using scientific terms (\"furin cleave,\" \"ACE2 receptor\"), but he ignored explanations found in the study. He didn’t account for how the original virus has evolved since 2020, or how the study emphasized these potential mutations were rare and would have little to no public health impact.\n\nPublic health experts say that racial disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality — in the U.S., Black and Hispanic people often faced more severe COVID-19 outcomes — resulted from social and economic inequities, not genetics.\n\nKennedy says \"circumstantial evidence\" is enough.\n\nAntidepressants, or SSRIs, are linked to school shootings, he told listeners on a livestream hosted by Elon Musk. The government should have begun studying the issue years ago, he said, because \"there’s tremendous circumstantial evidence that those, like SSRIs and benzos and other drugs, are doing this.\"\n\nExperts in psychiatry have told PolitiFact and other fact-checkers that there is no causal relationship between antidepressants and shootings. With 13% of the adult population using antidepressants, experts say that if the link were true they would expect higher rates of violence. Also, the available data on U.S. school shootings show most shooters were not using psychiatric medicines, which have an anti-violence effect.\nConspiracy theories, consequences and a presidential campaign\n\nThe anti-censorship candidate frames his first bid for public office as a response to \"18 years\" of being shunned for his views — partly by the government, but also by private companies.  \n\n\"You're protected so much from censorship if you're running for president,\" Kennedy told conservative Canadian podcaster and psychologist Jordan Peterson in June. \n\nIn June, Kennedy’s Instagram account was reinstated — with a verified badge noting he is a public figure. Meta’s rules on misinformation do not apply to active political candidates. (PolitiFact is a partner of Meta’s Third Party Fact-Checking Program, which seeks to reduce false content on the platform.)\n\nIn July, he was invited to testify before the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. He repeated that he had \"never been anti-vax,\" and railed against the Biden White House for asking Twitter to remove his January 2021 tweet that said Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron’s death was \"part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly,\" weeks after Aaron, 86, received a COVID-19 vaccine. The medical examiner’s office said Aaron died from unrelated natural causes.\n\nThroughout 2023, alternative media has embraced Kennedy. He has regularly appeared on podcasts such as Peterson’s, and has also participated in profiles by mainstream TV, online and print sources.\n\n\"You’re like, ‘But you're talking right now. I’m listening to you. I hear your words. You’re not being censored,’\" said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor in the School of Journalism and Communication at the University of Oregon who researches how news media covers conspiracy theories and their proponents. \"But a person can believe they’re being censored because they’ve internalized that they’re going to be,\" or they know making the claim will land with their audience.\n\nTime will tell whether his message resonates with voters.\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Kennedy may be a \"placeholder\" for voters who are dissatisfied with Trump and Biden and will take a third option when offered by pollsters.\n\nThe only 2024 candidate whose favorability ratings are more positive than negative? It’s Kennedy, according to FiveThirtyEight. However, a much higher percentage of voters are unfamiliar with him than they are with Trump or Biden — about a quarter — and Kennedy's favorability edge has decreased as his campaign has gone on.\n\nNevertheless, third-party candidates historically finish with a fraction of their polling, Kondik said, and voters will likely have more names and parties on their fall ballots, including philosopher Cornel West, physician Jill Stein and a potential slate from the No Labels movement.\n\nKennedy was popular with conservative commentators before he became an independent, and he has avoided pointedly criticizing Trump, except on COVID-19 lockdowns. When NBC News asked Kennedy in August what he thought of Trump’s 2020 election lies, Kennedy said he believed Trump lost, but that, in general, people who believe elections were stolen \"should be listened to.\" Kennedy is one of them; he still says that the 2004 presidential election was \"stolen\" from Kerry in favor of Republican George W. Bush, though it wasn't. \n\nAmerican Values 2024 will spend up to $15 million to get Kennedy’s name on the ballot in 10 states including Arizona, California, Indiana, New York and Texas. Those are five of the toughest states for ballot access, said Richard Winger, co-editor of Ballot Access News.\n\nFour of Kennedy’s siblings called Kennedy’s decision to run as an independent \"dangerous\" and \"perilous\" to the country. \"Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,\" the group wrote in a joint statement.\n\nKennedy brushes it off when asked, saying he has a large family, and some members support him.\n\nOn her podcast, Weiss asked whether Kennedy worried his position on autism and vaccines would cloud his other positions and cost him votes. His answer ignored his history. \n\n\"Show me where I got it wrong,\" he said, \"and I’ll change.\"\n\nIn a campaign constructed by lies, that might be the biggest one.",

        "date": "2023-12-20",
        "articleBody": "A rare look at how your favorite actual play gets made\n\nBackBack when I was running the game for my local Dungeons & Dragons group, I would always pride myself on bringing something handmade each time we got together around the table. Maybe it was a leather-bound book filled with vintage David Sutherland illustrations of the Tomb of Horrors, or a 3D map of a few rooms from Castle Ravenloft with just the right assortment of miniatures from my collection. As a lifelong fan of D&D, Rick Perry knows that impulse well. But as production designer and creative producer on Dropout’s Dimension 20, he’s operating at a scale that’s on another level entirely.\n\nSeason 21 of Dimension 20, an actual play program on the streaming television service Dropout, will premiere on Jan. 10, 2024. It’s an incredible run that shows no sign of slowing down, and Perry’s work has been integral in its popularity. To celebrate his impact, Dropout has released a feature documentary titled The Legendary Rick Perry and the Art of Dimension 20. In advance of its release, Polygon sat down with the lifelong Texan, now a resident of Washington state, to discuss his work.\n\nWhile world class Dungeon Masters like Brennan Lee Mulligan, Aabria Iyengar, Gabe Hicks, and Matthew Mercer lead each game at the start of each Dimension 20 season with a high-level creative direction, it’s up to Perry and his team of skilled artists to bring that vision to life in miniature on the table. That means creating hundreds of inch-tall figures from scratch using clay and sculpting tools; kitbashing dozens of scale models into fantastical landscapes to anchor the viewer in the world; and crafting dynamic, multi-tiered battle maps where skilled improv actors can chew up the set.\n\nJust like the props you bring to your home games, it’s bait, really, that he willfully uses to draw players — and viewers — closer to the center of whatever complex story he’s trying to tell.\n\n“Dimension 20 [requires] a massive amount of creative genesis to create a 20-episode series,” Perry said, “[one that] that takes place in a completely new world where we don’t know what color the sky is, or what food the people are eating. So there’s this massive amount of creative activity that has to start at the beginning of it, and that takes a big chunk of time.”\n\nThe documentary details how that creative work begins at his homestead on Lopez Island in San Juan County, Washington at an outdoor sink first cobbled together by his father-in-law in the 1970s. It then moves into a converted three-car garage that once held farming equipment, but is now filled with bins labeled for the miniatures they contain — a box of trolls here, bugbears in the corner. Only after weeks, sometimes months of effort on the farm with a whole team of designers do the larger pieces get crated up and shipped to Los Angeles. Often, Perry said, that’s where the real work begins.\n\nThe trick, he went on, is to stay nimble — even when you’re building maps for tabletop encounters that won’t happen for weeks.\n\n“It’s part of the DNA of Dimension 20,” Perry said, “because at the very beginning when we decided we wanted these eight battle maps that are custom, that have this mix of say high school and fantasy, it’s not like something we can just crank out really fast. We need to know ahead of time in order to make skater dwarves, and all this sort of stuff.\n\n“That means that we have to map all that out down to every detail — as much as we can,” Perry continued. That sort of on-rails gameplay is, unfortunately, anathema to modern role-play, which emphasizes creative freedom for the Dungeon Master as well as the players at the table. It’s always a challenge, Perry said, to keep things on track. But with a miniature set that, often times, costs just as much as a full-scale one, it’s up to everyone involved to keep the trains running on time.\n\n“That tells the Dungeon Master that these are landmarks,” Perry said. “These [scenes that we are building] are places that you have to pilot the ship through these little hoops. We try to build in as much flexibility, as much opportunity for improvisation as possible, meaning that sometimes where a battle map falls, they could switch places or we could cut one. We try not to cut one because they cost money to make. And it’s a business venture, the show, and we want all that production value to appear on screen.”\n\nThe nearly 45-minute film goes even further in its exploration of Perry and his work, delving deep into his childhood and his time spent in college as a member of a troupe of performance artists. For fans of Dimension 20, it’s a rare behind-the-scenes look at how its particular brand of storytelling comes to life. But for artists, craftspeople, or even just casual hobbyists who paint miniatures on the weekend for fun, it’s the story of a kindred spirit who has found a vital, transformative role in the creative industry.",

It’s Suki and Jet!\n\nIn honor of the winter solstice — aka the day in the Avatar-verse when the line between the spirit world and the human world is blurred — Netflix released some new first-look photos of the upcoming live-action reimagining of Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nThis round of photos highlights some of the series’ most beloved minor characters, particularly freedom fighter Jet (Sebastian Amoruso); bounty hunter June (Arden Cho); and Kyoshi Warrior Suki (Maria Zhang). Oh, and also, Danny Pudi is the Mechanist (remember him?).\n\nThere’s a bonus photo of Gordon Cormier’s Aang meditating, too.

However, the two left production two years later, explaining that the vision of the Netflix series did not align with the “spirit and integrity of Avatar.” They’ve since gone on to announce new animated projects in the Avatar-verse.\n\nMeanwhile, a new creative crew, led by Sleepy Hollow’s Albert Kim, took over the Netflix show. Michael Goi (Riverdale), Jabbar Raisani (Lost in Space), and Roseanne Liang (Shadow in the Cloud) also joined as directors. The main cast includes Gordon Cormier (The Stand) as Aang; Kiawentiio (Anne with an E) as Katara; Ian Ousley as Sokka; and Dallas Liu (Pen15) as Zuko.

        "authors": "Laura Baisas |",
        "date": "2023-11-16",
        "articleBody": "Researchers collected data from 30,085 British and Australian veterans who served during the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nNew research from Oxford University and the University of Adelaide found that asbestos exposure has led to a higher incidence of asbestos-related lung cancers in British and Australian naval personnel. The study published November 14 in the journal Scientific Reports estimates that the proportion of lung cancers related to onboard asbestos exposure was 27 percent in Australian naval personnel and 12 percent in British servicemembers.\n\nToxic exposure\n\nThis study is a reminder of the continuing need for protections against exposure to harmful airborne dusts and other dangerous substances from sources like toxic burn pits. According to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, nearly 300,000 United States veterans have reported exposure to pollution from burn pits since the early 2000s. The chemical pollutants that were released during these burns include volatile organic compounds associated with cancer, kidney disease, and nervous system damage. In August 2022, President Joe Biden signed the PACT Act into law to address the health concerns related to burn pits like these.\n\nIllnesses related to asbestos exposure persist, despite the mineral being a known carcinogen. Asbestos has been used in a wide variety of building materials for their strength, flexibility, and electrical and heat resistant properties. Breathing it in can cause mesothelioma, lung cancer, and a non-cancerous condition called asbestosis. About 1,290 Americans die annually from asbestos-related causes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAustralia currently has a ban and strict control on asbestos-containing materials, they still pose a risk to some workers. A 2021-2022 New South Wales Dust Disease Register report found that there were 142 cases of asbestosis and 111 deaths related to the illness. \n\nIn the United States, asbestos use is not completely banned. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed another ban in April of 2022 that has yet to be finalized. \n\nAn increased risk to sailors\n\nFor this study, researchers collected data from 30,085 United Kingdom and Australian personnel who served during the 1950s and 1960s. During this time period, asbestos-containing materials were still present in British and Australian naval vessels. Earlier studies of one Australian and two British cohorts also involved in this new research found that increased rates of lung cancer could not be attributed to radiation exposure from nuclear testing. The team used a separate study of Australian Korean War veterans as a comparison in this new research.\n\nThe team found that all four cohorts had an elevated incidence of mesothelioma among naval veterans. This same rate was not not statistically significant among sailors from the Korean War. British and Australian personnel involved in nuclear testing also saw higher rates of lung cancers.\n\nAdditionally, the rates of pulmonary disease and heart disease were similar between naval and army personnel. This suggests that smoking was not driving higher lung cancer rates among sailors.\n\n“We found the lung cancer rate was higher overall in naval personnel than in the other armed services, and, while smoking remains the dominant cause of lung cancer, it is unlikely the excess could be explained by a higher smoking rate in the navy,” study co-author and University of Adelaide medical doctor Richard Gun said in a statement.  “Although actual measurements of airborne asbestos levels were not available, and estimates are difficult, we have concluded that the higher lung cancer rate in sailors was most probably caused by onboard asbestos exposure.”\n\nThe high occurrence of deaths in sailors from asbestosis also strengthened the team’s conclusion. The team believes that the effects of asbestos exposure are likely underestimated, unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis.\n\n“Although it remains true that smoking causes most lung cancers, other agents such as asbestos can contribute to the incidence of cancer in an exposed population,” Gun said. “Moreover, we know from other studies that the combination of smoking and asbestos exposure has an enhanced influence on lung cancer risk; this interactive effect would have contributed to the observed lung cancer excess.”",

        "authors": "Jean Levasseur",
        "date": "2023-10-27",
        "articleBody": "How to know when to use the table saw, pull out a hand saw, or grab something else. \n\nThere are a few variables to think about when deciding which tool to use when you need to cut a piece of wood. First, figure out what you own that’s capable of making the cut. Sometimes that limits the options to one tool, and that’s what you should go with. But when multiple tools will do the job, you’ll have to do a little more calculus. \n\nDon’t worry, I’m not talking about actual calculus. You will, however, have to run some mental calculations that weigh your comfort using the qualified tools against the difficulty of what you’re doing. For complex or new cuts, I like to use the tool I’m most comfortable with. Simpler cuts, meanwhile, might give me an opportunity to practice with a tool I don’t use often. Finally, because I work in a small shop, I always consider a tool’s accessibility. A saw that’s already out and plugged in is far more attractive than a tool I have to dig out from the back of a cabinet.\n\nIf you’re new to woodworking, or just looking for more insight on the choices you have to make in the shop, here’s a primer on the types of saws you’re likely to have access to, and the cuts they’re best at. \n\nTable saw: good for long cuts\n\nTable saws are built to make rip cuts, which means slicing long boards in the same direction as the grain. If you’re trying to trim a 2-by-6 down to 4 inches wide, a table saw is the best tool you can use, hands down.\n\nMost table saws are built with slots on either side of the blade, called miter slots. These allow jigs to slide over the tabletop to help you make different types of cuts. One example is a miter gauge, which probably came with your saw. This jig can hold boards at different orientations to the blade, allowing you to cut a wide range of angles. You can also make larger sleds, called miter or crosscut sleds to cut a variety of non-rip cuts.\n\nAnother jig category rides along the table saw’s fence instead of in a miter slot. A jointer sled or tapering jig, for instance, uses the fence as a reference point to make perfectly straight or tapered cuts, depending on how it’s set up. Other fence-referencing jigs can stand boards on end. A tenoning jig, for example, allows you to clamp a board vertically to cut tenons into the ends of the board, a job that would be quite dangerous without the stability the jig provides. \nWhere a table saw falls short\n\nThere are a few limitations to table saws. The first is that they aren’t versatile unless you build (or buy) the right jig, which can take hours and shrink your bank account. Not to mention the storage space those jigs take up—it might not be worth spending time or money on one if you’re only going to use it one or two times. Of course, if you can’t figure out a safe or effective way to make a cut without a jig, go ahead and add one to your collection. Table saws can also only cut straight, so they’re useless if you need a nice curve. \n\nFinally, most table saws that a homeowner or hobbyist would own can only cut boards as large as the user can lift and maneuver. Cutting full sheets of plywood on my table, for example, is almost impossible, especially by myself. Likewise, the blade on my saw can only be raised to about 3.5 inches. Even if I flip the board over and cut twice, I can’t cut anything thicker than 7 inches on the table saw alone. So, versatile as it is, this can’t be the only saw in your shop. \n\nMiter saw: good for angled cuts\n\nIf you’re only looking to cut boards to length, or add angles to the ends, a good miter saw might be your best bet. All you’ll need to do is place the board on the flat surface beneath the blade, pull the trigger, and lower the saw to make the cut. If you pair a miter saw with a good stop block system, it’s easy to make repeated cuts of uniform length.  \n\nThe entire blade assembly can turn to make angled cuts on the face of the board, tilt to angle the end of the board, or tilt and turn to angle both the face and the end. This dual angling capacity makes these great saws for the complex cuts needed for crown molding. However, achieving the precision required for that kind of finish work requires you to really set up and fine-tune your machine.\nA miter saw’s limitations\n\nLike a table saw, a miter saw has de facto size limits. For one, miter saws have a maximum board width they can cut through, though you can flip the board over to extend that. Perhaps more importantly, miter saws are limited by how large a board you can lift, because this is another type of saw you have to bring the wood to.\n\nTrack saw: good for boards you can’t move around\n\nIf you’ve got a board too big to realistically or safely cut on a table saw or miter saw, a track saw should be your next choice. These are basically circular saws that lock into and follow a straight edge that you clamp to your board. A track saw is the perfect tool to break down large sheets of plywood into usable sizes, or to trim up the edges of a table or countertop that’s simply too long to feed into a table saw. They can also tilt to cut at an angle, so they’re perfect for chamfering the underside of a table without the risk of tearout that you might get from a large router bit.\n\nUnlike table saws, track saws don’t require a reference edge to cut. So if you want to cut a straight edge on a live-edge slab, for example, you can align the track where you need it, and make the cut.\n\nWhen not to use a track saw\n\nWhile they’re one of the best homeowner-accessible tools for cutting large sheet goods or live-edge slabs, track saws are quite a bit slower than table saws because of the increased measuring and setup time. They also don’t have the same ability to accept jigs, so they lack some of the versatility of a table saw. \n\nBand saw: good for weird, curved cuts\n\nBand saws can make most of the same cuts miter and table saws can, but I’ve found they don’t do them quite as well. There are, however, two types of cuts where a good band saw stands alone.\n\nFirst is strangely shaped cuts. Band saws are great for cutting curved pieces or somewhat intricate shapes out of a board. The band saw is limited to staying on the outside of the shapes—you can’t cut a circle in the center of another board, for instance, but you can cut a board into a circle. \n\nThe second area is resawing, or sawing a thick board in half. Technically, a table saw can do this too, but a band saw can do it without you having to flip the board over and make two passes. Larger band saws, like a 14-inch one, can cut much taller pieces than a table saw can even with flipping.\n\nWhere band saws fall short\n\nBand saws do require a bit more practice and experience to both maintain and use well than either a table saw or miter saw do. The blade has to be properly tensioned, the fence and guide bearings have to be set up properly, and you need to have the right blade for your job. It’s also easy for a band saw blade to get stuck in the project, and potentially snap, which can ruin your workpiece, or worse, injure you.\n\nJigsaw: good for curved cuts on larger pieces of wood\n\nIf you need to make a weird-shaped cut and your workpiece is too large and awkward for a band saw, consider a jigsaw. This tool is a handheld saw with a thin, vertical blade sticking out of the bottom that moves up and down to make cuts. Jigsaws can cut curves and corners alike, and have a tight turning radius to make detailed work easier. There are also numerous available blades for different kinds of cuts. Some are best for rough, fast cuts, some are thin for getting into tight spaces, and others have lots of teeth for finer finish work. Jigsaws can also cut shapes on interior sections of a board, provided that you can drill a hole large enough to fit the blade.\n\nA jigsaw’s limitations\n\nUnless you have a lot of practice and a high-end machine, a jigsaw will serve you best as a rough cutting option. You’ll want to cut your shape a bit oversized and then sand it down to finished dimensions. Jigsaws are also a bit harder to control than a band saw, so it’s easy for the blade to wander. And blades might bend and flex inside the wood, so the cut on the bottom of the board might not be perfectly in line with the cut on the top. Finally, jigsaws require you to figure out how to clamp your workpiece into place with open air below it, because the blade penetrates all the way through the wood.\n\nScroll saw: good for finish work\n\nIf you’re looking for intricate detail and artistic through-cuts in your boards, a scroll saw—sort of a combination between a band saw and a jigsaw— is the tool for you. The saw’s short blade vibrates up and down like a jigsaw, but is secured to the machine at the top and bottom so you can move the board over a table like a band saw. This setup offers incredible precision, as well as the ability to disconnect the blade, slide it through a hole in the board, and reattach it. The detachable blade means you can start cuts in the middle of the board like a jigsaw, too. \n\nWhen not to use a scroll saw\n\nIt’s worth noting that scroll saws cut fairly slowly. Because they’re designed for precision rather than power, you won’t be able to move through a lot of material at once. That means they’re not a feasible option for processing wood—you shouldn’t use one to rip boards or crosscut anything to length. There’s also a bit of a learning curve, as it can take hours of practice to get the most out of a scroll saw. I’m still terrible with them, though I’ve only used one a handful of times.\n\nThat said, there are few better ways to cut beautiful scenes into your wood. \n\nHand saws: a dimension of their own\n\nWhile power tools tend to be faster, and, frankly, more accurate in beginner hands, not every situation needs electricity. Sometimes the gentle rasp of a saw moving back and forth through the board is exactly what your project requires. And I truly find an accurate hand-sawn cut quite a bit more satisfying than one I just pushed through the table saw. Though of course, the odds that I mess up that hand-cut are quite a bit higher.\n\nThere are too many types of hand saws to cover in this article, but I’d like to talk about the two I use most often. \n\nPull saw: good for low-effort cuts\n\nIf you’ve never used a pull saw, I recommend trying one, because it’ll change your outlook on hand sawing. The saws many of us grew up using to slice branches off of trees are saws that cut on the push stroke. Pull saws, as their name implies, cut on the pull stroke. Conveniently, this is the direction where we are both strongest and the most stable. When you push a saw through wood, the tip becomes more and more unstable as there’s nothing locking it in place and preventing it from vibrating back and forth. When you pull it toward you, however, the force of the board and your hand on the handle keep the blade steady and smooth through the entire cut.  \n\nThe easiest cut to make with a pull saw is a rip cut, which is following the grain. However, they’re perfectly capable of cross cutting as well. And with practice, they can be a precision instrument. Many people use pull saws to cut intricate joinery, for instance, though they do still typically need to clean up the edges with chisels.\n\nCoping saw: good for intricate manual cuts\n\nCoping saws have a U-shaped handle and—like a scroll saw—a thin blade attached at the front and back. The blade is similarly detachable, so you can slip it through a hole in a board and make cuts on the inside of the face. And because the blade is so thin, it can easily turn and curve inside the wood. This allows you to cut all kinds of fancy shapes. They’re excellent for removing material in joinery, like hogging out the bases of dovetails or trimming a back cut on molding.  \n\nThe cuts can get a bit wobbly, though, and there’s no built-in way to keep them square to your board, so the top and bottom of the cut likely won’t line up exactly. As such, it’s usually best to use these saws to get close to the cut line, and then finish everything with chisels, files, or other more precise tools.",

Cooper skyjacking of Thanksgiving Eve 1971—the only unsolved commercial airline hijacking in U.S. history—that he’s literally suing the FBI to make it happen.\n\nIn 2022, Ulis laid out his theory on how the remnants of an alloy that the FBI reportedly found on Cooper’s tossed tie pinpoint the skyjacker’s workplace to a “Midland, Pennsylvania-based manufacturer of titanium-antimony.” All Ulis needs now, he feels, is the samples off the tie themselves, which is why he’s pursuing litigation to procure them.\n\nUlis, like many other amateur sleuths, hopes to finally answer the 51-year-old question: “Who was D.B. Cooper?” But before he can address that one, we first have to ask another: “Why do people still care about D.B. Cooper?”\n\nLet’s start with the fateful day that we (sort of) met the man (incorrectly) called D.B. Cooper. \n\nD.B. Cooper: The Mystery Man\n\nIt’s November 24, 1971.\n\nThe #1 movie in America is The French Connection, a gritty neo-noir where handsome Hollywood stars Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider get stylishly dirtied up to play NYPD cops chasing down heroin smugglers. At the same time, the #1 song on the radio is Isaac Hayes's “Theme from Shaft,” the iconic song soundtracking a film about the impeccably tailored detective John Shaft, who would just as soon work with the pushers and pimps of Harlem than take help from the NYPD, as long as he gets justice. Which is all to suggest that in November 1971, the U.S. hasn’t quite figured out who to root for in the proverbial game of “cops and robbers.”\n\nBut the mystery man of the hour on that November afternoon looked nothing like the gritty-but-glamorous stars of the day's premier crime dramas. He was, as the FBI described him, a \"white male, 6'1\" tall, 170-175 pounds, age-mid-forties, olive complexion, brown eyes, black hair, conventional cut, parted on left.\" \n\nHe purchased, in cash, a one-way ticket aboard Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 from Portland to Seattle. He paid $18.52, and gave the name “Dan Cooper.” There was no ID checked, no security protocols of any kind. “Dan Cooper” was permitted to board his flight unencumbered.\n\nThis might be the point in the story where you think, “Well, they couldn't have expected that somebody would hijack the plane.” But while apparently they didn't, they absolutely should have. \n\nThese days, our idea of plane hijackers is either D.B. Cooper, the terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks, or those scrappy prisoners from Con Air. But by 1971, skyjacking was a fairly regular occurrence. In fact, Vox notes that \"between May 1961 and the end of 1972, there were 159 hijackings in American airspace.\" Hijackings, or as they were colloquially called, \"skyjackings,\" were common enough that, the year prior to the D.B. Cooper affair, the British comedy troupe Monty Python aired a sketch mocking the absurd frequency of the act.\n\nD.B. Cooper's Skyjacking, Explained\n\n\"Onboard the Boeing jet, [Cooper] had a bourbon and soda, smoked cigarettes, and gave a flight attendant a note that said he had a bomb,\" Biography reports. In fact, the flight attendant to whom the note was passed, Florence Schaffner, didn't even read the note initially.\n\nGeoffrey Gray's Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper goes into great detail on the degree to which flight attendants of the time were subject to harassment and inappropriate behavior from passengers. Schaffner likely assumed the note was merely a suggestive missive from an amorous traveler until the man whispered to her, \"Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb.\"\n\nBut did Cooper really have a bomb? Well, he certainly had \"a case containing wires and red sticks,\" and that was enough for him to get his demands heard. What did Cooper want? \"$200,000 in $20 bills, as well as four parachutes.\"\n\nThe Great D.B. Cooper Escape\n\nHere’s where we get our first bit of evidence that Cooper knew a bit more than your usual hijacker. Cooper's request of four parachutes was made so that those on the ground would think he intended to take a hostage with him. Had he only requested two (parachuting always involves two chutes: the primary and the backup), there was a chance he would have been given dummy chutes so that he would plummet to his death rather than get away with the money. (Our anti-hijacking strategies back then were pretty bad, and this one wasn't even the dumbest idea we had.) But they wouldn't risk that happening to an innocent hostage. Cooper was in control.\n\nThat meant Cooper got his way. The plane landed in Seattle, the hostages were exchanged for the ransom, and a skeleton crew (\"two pilots, a flight engineer, and a flight attendant\") took Cooper back in the air, toward Mexico City. Cooper instructed the pilots to \"fly lower than 10,000 feet, at a speed under 200 knots\" and to lower the planes aft stairs. He then descended those stairs, unseen, and parachuted into the night, with $200,000 in tow, leaving behind only a black necktie (and some cigarette butts that have since gone missing).\n\nHow Dan Cooper Became D.B. Cooper\n\nWhat Cooper couldn't control, however, was whether anyone got his fake name right.\n\nYou'll recall that he gave the name \"Dan Cooper\" when he purchased his plane ticket. He possibly took the moniker from a Franco-Belgian comic book entitled Les Aventures de Dan Cooper, whose stories notably involved \"jumping out of a plane with a parachute, as well as a ransom being delivered in a knapsack.\" So how did it become D.B.? Simple. Reporter James Long, of the Oregon Journal in Portland, simply got the name wrong. \"Either because the Northwest [source] gave it to me wrong or because the noisy [phone] connection helped me misunderstand it,\" Long would later confess to the LA Times.\n\nBut it stuck, and D.B. Cooper became the name that earned both infamy and, in some corners, folk-hero status amongst a fading counter-culture desperate for remnants of the \"anti-establishment.\"\n\nWhat Happened to D.B. Cooper?\n\nSo what became of D.B. Cooper? No one truly knows. While the ransom money never entered circulation, some of it did turn up in 1980, badly decomposed and buried on the north shore of the Columbia River, discovered by 8-year-old Brian Ingram.\n\nThough suspects emerged throughout the years, all were ruled out for various reasons by the FBI. And in 2016, the FBI officially closed the book on the D.B. Cooper investigation, choosing to devote its resources elsewhere.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped citizen detectives like Eric Ulis from trying to crack the Cooper case.\nWhy Do We Still Care About D.B. Cooper?\n\nWhich brings us back to the \"Why?\" What keeps people coming back to D.B. Cooper, long after the crime, the investigation, and that entire era of unsecured, casual air travel are all consigned to the history books?\n\nSean and Carrie McCabe, whose true-crime podcast Ain't It Scary? with Sean & Carrie covered Cooper in an early episode, have a hunch about why the intrepid airplane criminal in the cool eyewear remains in the public consciousness.\n\n\"First, like all of the best true crime stories, it's because there's no clear answer,\" Sean tells PopMech. \"We don't know who the guy was, and we likely never will know for sure. And that leaves room for everyone to bring their own opinion and their own investigator hat, and speculate without any fear of ever really being proven wrong.\"\n\nCarrie suggests that it's also the nature of Cooper's crime that keeps people coming back to it:\n\n    \"D.B. Cooper was kind of a cool figure. He didn't hurt anybody (aside from maybe himself) in his crime, he didn't use aggressive physical force. I think that makes him an object of fascination that people can be more openly interested in than, say, a serial killer. Being interested in true crime often comes with a lot of caveats - \"I don't like Jeffrey Dahmer, I just like learning more about his pathology\", etc. - but with Cooper's relatively victimless crime, you don't have to feel creepy if you're interested.\"\n\n\"We don't have to co-sign Dan Cooper's actions for a little tiny part of us to wish we were him,\" Sean concurs.\n\nWhen pressed if they think the D.B. Cooper case will ever be solved, the podcasters concede it's unlikely. \"God, I'm trying to think of the \"fun\" answer, but ... no?\" Sean says. \"Probably not. None of the money has ever been spent, which makes me think our 'Mr. Cooper' probably died in the jump.\"\n\n\"I think the only way it'll ever be cracked is if...,\" Carrie adds, \"...at this point, someone comes forward with concrete proof that their deceased relative was Cooper, like a stack of the missing money.\"\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, some residue of alloy on a tie could be the thing to crack this whole case wide open...",

        "articleBody": "Jonny “JonnyCakes” Manganello explains the tricks of the trade from his time on the Netflix series Is It Cake?\n\nHyperrealistic cakes (like the one pictured above) have been all the rage the last few years, from massively popular TikTok and Instagram accounts to Netflix’s 2022 competition show Is It Cake? The skilled and patient people who create these sweet treats strive for them to look just like everyday objects. But you may not know that many of the tools of the realistic cake trade (and of cake decorating, in general) aren’t from a fancy specialty shop—they’re from your local hardware store.\n\nWith that in mind, we reached out to Jonny “JonnyCakes” Manganello, a hyperrealistic cake maker from Is It Cake?, to give us a quick and dirty rundown of what you need to get started in making badass realistic cakes of your own.\n\nManganello is from Grosse Point, Michigan, and moved to Los Angeles as an aspiring actor. “I have my failed acting career to thank for starting to bake,” Manganello tells Popular Mechanics. “I was forced to work a lot of other odd jobs. I nannied these two kids, and we liked to watch baking shows together. I thought, I gotta try it myself. During Covid, I really honed my hyperrealistic baking skills while others were home-baking sourdough bread.”\n\nHis YouTube channel features process videos and skits with finalized cakes—during a recent YouTube short, I gasped when he stuck a dead-on disposable razor (cake) in his mouth—but Manganello doesn’t want viewers to think he’s perfect. His videos are funny and self-effacing, with callbacks to embarrassing moments from Is It Cake? “What I put online is very much the final draft of many, many drafts and many failures,” he says. \n\n“I wonder how I’m going to [move] forward, because I don’t want to just be someone who’s posting successes, look how great this turned out! I enjoy sitting there and troubleshooting as I go, and figuring out a new strategy or technique I never would have thought of if I didn’t fail,” Manganello says. That shows in his videos, where he shares tons of practical tips, and in a new realistic “bowl of cereal” cake kit he’s selling. He enjoys making the funny and shocking “after” videos and skits just as much as the ones about the decorating process, and he also makes traditional cakes.\n\nHere are some of the must-have tools for realistic cakes. Since these cakes are designed to look like regular objects, many tools are the same ones you’d use when painting or building:\n\n  Food-safe silicone mold, a material you mix to activate and then press around the shape of something you want to recreate, like how your dentist takes an imprint: “This allows me to mold something with incredibly fine detail and recreate it with fondant, modeling chocolate, or my favorite—tempered chocolate. Things I’ve molded in the past include items as small as a penny or as large as a rotary phone,” Manganello says.\n   \n Xacto knife, a pen-shaped knife that takes a disposable, razorlike blade: “A super sharp blade is your best friend in the kitchen,” Manganello says. “It allows for precise cuts that won’t tear or snag your fondant.”\n    \nBrushes of all sizes: \"Half of decorating is painting with edible paints. I wish I had a degree in fine art! I use brushes daily,” Manganello says.\n    \nSponges, whether for dishes or from the sea: “For more natural-looking items [like] bread, skin, [and] tree bark, sponges can help sell the illusion. They’re good for applying edible paint, blending, and texturing,” Manganello says.\n  \n  Doweling, the same wooden sticks used in cabinetmaking or other projects: “Dowels are the reason your wedding cake didn’t topple over,” Manganello says. “Always use dowels.”\n   \n Flanges, flared connectors that can anchor a length of pipe or threaded rod to a flat base or hold up an elevated base: “Sometimes cakes need extra support that dowels can’t provide,” Manganello says. “I competed on a TV show where we needed to keep a four-foot-tall Santa cake upright. Securing him to a solid base with a flange was a must.”\n   \n Food-safe aluminum tape: “When using non food-safe items like flanges and threaded rods, it’s important to add a food-safe barrier. Aluminum tape does just this,” Manganello says. (Influential shows like Ace of Cakes often included inedible structural things, like styrofoam. Many realistic bakers today pride themselves on making cakes as safe and edible as possible.)\n\nAnd here are some specialty tools for cake decorating in particular:\n\n    Stitching tool, which looks like a cowboy spur on a stick, and rolls over fondant to create stitch marks: “These are great for selling the illusion of fabric. I used a stitching tool to create a bucket hat on Is It Cake?” Manganello says. In the second season, a competitor used one when creating an uncanny Dr. Martens boot.\n   \n Offset spatula, a flat metal tool with an essential bend and handle: “A kitchen must have,” Manganello says. “This allows you to frost a cake without getting your fingers in the frosting! The raised handle keeps your hand up and away from the cake.”\n    \nBench scraper, a sturdy metal edge used to scrape flat tops in diners: “Bench scrapers allow you to get a smooth, even coat of frosting around your entire cake,” Manganello says.\n    \nCake turntable: “Like in pottery, a spinning table allows for symmetrical, uniform sides to your circular cakes,” Manganello says.\n   \n Piping bags, which you fill and then snip the end of to create a neat, uniform line: “These help keep mess to a minimum as you’re able to apply filling, frosting, and ganache exactly where you need it,” Manganello says. (In a pinch, a Ziploc bag is also a big help.)\n  \n  Piping tips, small metal or plastic cones that fit into piping bags and have decorative openings: “These help create a finished border to your cakes,” Manganello says. “They allow the final product to really look stellar.”\n    \nSaran Wrap or other plastic wrap: “Saran Wrap keeps moisture in your freshly baked cakes,” Manganello says. “I take my still-warm cakes out of their pans, wrap them tightly in Saran Wrap, and immediately pop them in the freezer! This locks in moisture and keeps your cakes tender.”\n\nManganello’s cereal bowl cake kit came from a similar place, demystifying realistic baking and giving people tools they need to try it out. “I was getting all these requests for classes and workshops, and that doesn’t make total sense for my current schedule,” he says. “I love sharing and doing tutorials and teaching people, so I thought this would be a way to do that without having to be with somebody in person.” The kit includes a pan and some industry-standard tools, along with cake mix and cereal.\n\nAs for his own cake goals, Manganello says he has some things he dreams of making someday. “I would love to do a piece of furniture,” he says. “[Or a] functional cuckoo clock that tells time, hangs on the wall, and at whatever hour on the hour a little bird comes out and [goes] cheep cheep cheep.”",

        "articleBody": "Plus! A look at the bag that stole my heart...\n\nShopping for luxury goods has become seamlessly easy in the modern digital age. With a few clicks of your fingers, you can purchase a new Valentino Garavani handbag and that pair of shoes haunting you while waiting for the subway.\n\nWhile there’s something to be said about the convenience of it all, nothing beats the full-service experience of shopping in a luxury boutique and seeing products in real life, all while sipping on champagne. Not to mention the unmistakable rush of walking out with something new in hand.\n\nLast month, Valentino’s brand-new flagship store on Madison Avenue in NYC opened its doors, and I stopped by to check it all out.\n\n                                                                         New On Madison\n\nThe new location is home to three floors, each dedicated to displaying various collections from the Maison. Of course, I was immediately drawn to the handbags, and behind the ornate double doors, finished with stunning sculptural marble handles, I was met with a wide array of bags.\n\nThe store itself is beautiful; there’s simply no other way of putting it, and the higher floors, which showcase Women’s Ready-To-Wear, offer an intimate, inviting feel. It’s that area where clients can book one of the store’s private rooms for a one-of-a-kind VIP shopping experience.\n\nPerfectly curated to feel like a sitting room, the private shopping rooms feature nods to the Maison’s ateliers. Warm and welcoming with a quintessential European vibe, you feel transported to Italy for a moment. Red details are featured throughout and within other store areas, paying homage to Valentino’s storied DNA.\n\n                                                                        Back to the Bags\n\nThe offerings are vast, and the best thing about shopping in-store is being able to compare and contrast, not to mention discover something you may not have been initially drawn to.\n\nI have always been a Rockstud girl. It’s a bag I kept coming back to but never actually committed to, and I specifically went to the store with a Valentino Garavani Rockstud bag in mind. While I thought I would head straight for the brand’s bold studs, other shapes caught my eye.\n\n                                                               Valentino Garavani’s Got a Brand New Bag\n\nFirst seen on the runway during the Maison’s L’École Spring/Summer 2024 presentation, the new Valentino Garavani VLogo Moon bag caught my eye. An entire display is dedicated to the new shape, which takes inspiration from the form of a crescent moon and is designed to take you from day to night.\n\nI tried it on in a few colors before realizing I favored the white hue, which felt seasonless and effortlessly chic. Its soft leather and bold details were the deciding factors for me. I was delighted that it feels suitable for daily, dressed-down wear and nights out alike.\n\nTwo sizes are currently available in-store, and the small was just the right size for me. I absolutely adore how it looks clutched by the hardware, which is one of the ways of wearing it. The VLogo acts like a bracelet, and carrying the bag this way is definitely statement-making. There’s a leather shoulder strap for daytime wear, which can’t be adjusted but can be removed.\n\nVisiting the newly-designed store was a great reminder of what an experience buying in-store can be. Plus, at a time when we’re all moving so fast, it was a great reminder to slow down, dive into the magical world of Valentino, and simply enjoy the entire process of picking up something new.\n\nVisit the new Valentino flagship store at 654 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10065, to discover the new Valentino Garavani VLogo Moon bag and much more.",

        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "Does non-leather equate to non-luxury?\n\nEarlier this year, when the singular madame Cate Blanchett appeared wildly flailing her arms in the highly entertaining music video of the Sparks hit single, The Girl is Crying in Her Latte (a title that, admittedly, hits dangerously close to home), sustainably-minded fashionistas all over rejoiced.\n\nHer outfit? A startling canary-yellow Stella McCartney two-piece suit that Blanchett was first spotted wearing at a press conference for Ocean’s 8, and subsequently, at the Sparks tour in Glastonbury, UK. There was a celebrity-brand pairing that went beyond the usual rut of creative conundrums, bolstering the narrative that sustainability is, at the end of the day, at the discretion of the wearer.\n\nOf course, it’s all very well as far as ready-to-wear is concerned (clearly, fast fashion is the enemy). But when the question is one of the accessories, the lines get blurred, sides are taken, and violence ensues. All to make a rather simple point: which is superior – leather or vegan leather?\n\nAnd does vegan leather – if there is truly such a thing as a fully “vegan” leather – possess the ability to command luxury leather prices?\n\nThe Annals of Alternative Leathers\n\nVegan leather, not to be confused with faux leather, polyurethane (PU) leather, or pleather, has long existed in its own category. Championed by brands that extend beyond the usual list of suspects, such as Stella McCartney, Vivienne Westwood, Nanushka, and more, to include more mainstream luxury houses, like Bottega Veneta, Givenchy, and Gucci, recent times have seen a major uptick in the use of the material, driven by the more sustainable trend towards consumption. \n\nThe most eco-friendly /vegan variants have been developed from mushrooms, such as MycoWorks’ trademarked creation, Reishi, reportedly said to match the tensile strength, feel, and durability of calfskin — the gold standard for leather.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of alternative leathers, ranging from Piñatex, derived from pineapple leaves, Desserto® formulated from cactus fibers, and apple and grape-based leathers, are generally composed of between 50-75% PU or polylactic acid-based bonding agents. So, it is not much better than pleather at all.\n\nOf course, aside from the recent breakthroughs in alternative leathers, leather alternatives have been a staple in the luxury realm. Prada’s historic nylon was recently revived as the ecologically conscious Re-Nylon extracted from regenerated ocean plastics. But the classification can be further extended to include monogram canvasses from the likes of Louis Vuitton – one we’re all too familiar with.\n \nIs Customer Perception to Blame?\n\nThen again, at the end of the day, the business of fashion… is still a business. And like it or not, the idea of sustainable leathers, no matter how lucrative it is on paper, isn’t likely to fly if customers aren’t prepared to drop luxury prices on them.\n\nIn fact, therein lies the dilemma inherent to sustainable capitalism. Despite the fact that producers like MycoWorks have attested to the viability of the large-scale production of the ostensibly 100% vegan variant of Reishi leather, can brands like Hermès charge top dollar for non-leather handbags? \n\nThe buyer response to Stella McCartney’s Mylo Frayme Bag, and Gucci’s Demetra, (both priced above the $3,000 price-ceiling), seems to suggest otherwise, more so in light of the fact that their durability over the longer term remains uncertain. \n\nFurthermore, the sel-described vegan brand, Freja New York, conducts a price-analysis that places their true cost of production at a mere $128, with a 2.3x premium for their selling price. What if this premium was five, ten or even twenty times higher?\n\nAs humans, we’re hardwired to think what’s expensive is automatically better. But in our efforts to justify exorbitant purchases, we also try to reconcile the price-tag with its constituents. And assuredly, no iteration of vegan leather in the past has managed to do so. So, it’s only fair that brands today are hesitant to take the next step, in fear of devaluing their historically high-status perception, if nothing else.\n\nNonetheless, in their constant competition to stay in the “now”, it’s also likely that more fashion houses will begin to experiment with sustainable materials, albeit at a much slower pace compared to their contemporary counterparts. And each new development will likely continue to be divisive, until we can all finally agree on one leather that’s truly vegan. Is Reishi that? Only time will tell.\n\nBut what we can be sure of is that it will be pricey.",

        "authors": "Michael Barone",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "At a time when voters have rejected the party of the incumbent president in the last two elections, and in which current polling has the incumbent trailing, both parties seem bent on nominating two men who have served as president and about whom substantial majorities of voters have negative feelings. What gives?\n\nYou could argue that each party is trying to manipulate the other into nominating a candidate whose liabilities are well known to the public. Certainly, Democrats' prosecutions of Donald Trump have had that effect.\n\nAs I noted in a November column, Trump led Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) by only 15 points when Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg handed down an obviously flimsy indictment on March 30. Within three weeks, Trump's lead over DeSantis doubled to 32 points, on its way to its current 51 points.\n\nThe obvious political motivation of these indictments -- and of the Colorado Supreme Court's exclusion of Trump from state ballots -- has boomeranged (or intentionally) helped Trump. Meanwhile, Republicans' apparent gains among black voters have deterred most Democrats from any thoughts of jettisoning Joe Biden and his similarly unpopular vice president.\n\nThis is not the first time voters have been rejecting incumbents. In a dozen years, four incumbents were ousted -- Lyndon Johnson in 1968, Richard Nixon in 1974, Gerald Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter in 1980. One reason was broken promises: LBJ campaigned as a peace candidate and made war in Vietnam. Nixon campaigned on law and order and violated the law. Ford introduced himself as a healer and pardoned Nixon, and Carter campaigned as an outsider and defended insider economic and arms control policies.\n\nHovering over all four, increasingly over the period, was inflation, just as the inflation apparently resulting from 2021 COVID legislation is hurting Biden today. It's visible now, as it was then, in the signs most people, but not Manhattanites or town house liberals, are confronted with every week: gas prices.\n\nIn this century, voters have rejected incumbent parties, but by narrower margins. Al Gore lost narrowly in 2000, John McCain by more in 2008, Hillary Clinton even while winning the popular vote in 2016, and Trump in 2020. George W. Bush and Barack Obama were reelected in 2004 and 2012, but with just 51% of the popular vote.\n\nThe 1968-80 period was more volatile, with much bigger swings in party percentages, because the bulk of the electorate then had living memories of the 1930s Depression and World War II. They were willing to cross party lines to reelect presidents who seemed to produce prosperity and peace, and to cross them the other way to reject those who didn't, or broke promises or brooked inflation.\n\nWithout such memories, voters in recent decades have mostly stuck to parties that reflect their deeply held cultural values, and so neither party wins landslides. The perverse result is that presidents and congressional leaders have been reluctant to compromise on major issues, because they plausibly hope to win a trifecta -- the White House and majorities in the Senate and House -- in the next presidential year.\n\nBush won trifectas narrowly in 2000 and 2004, Obama by a wider margin in 2008 but not in 2012, and Trump and Biden narrowly in 2016 and 2020. Obama failed in 2012 because he ran against Mitt Romney as a callous plutocrat, a tactic that didn't unseat demotic tea party House Republicans.\n\nIn this cycle, both parties have some reason to hope for a trifecta, reasons strong enough for primary voters to stay loyal to their most recent president. It's not certain that Biden will lose to Trump; it seems possible that Republicans will manage to once again blow a clear chance at a Senate majority, and it's certainly not clear which party will win the House. That may depend on whether New York's Democratic legislature produces a redistricting plan even more egregiously partisan than North Carolina's Republican legislature's.\n\nChanges in the current close partisan divisions tend, sooner or later, to offset each other. Affluent college graduates have become more Democratic -- a process begun in the Northeast, West Coast and Chicagoland in the 1990s, increasing countercyclically in 2004 in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and winding up with metro Atlanta and metro Phoenix swinging Democratic in 2020.\n\nOffsetting this, Hispanics and black people without a college degree have been trending at least a little more Republican than before -- a process begun in George W. Bush's Texas in the 1990s, delayed by the Obama candidacy but continuing countercyclically (and unnoticed by most of the political press) in 2020, and threatening to crescendo against Biden in 2024. Causes favored by voters moving toward Democrats have repelled others now moving toward Republicans.\n\nThe result is an election with an unpredictable outcome that will surely leave most people convinced the country is on the wrong track.",

        "articleBody": "The Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision did not outlaw abortion. The decision asserted that there does not exist a constitutional right to abortion and sent the issue back to the states to resolve with a limited role for the federal government (as was the case prior to 1973).\n\nThe Founding Fathers who met in Philadelphia to give life to a venerable Republic had great vision. Having chafed under monarchy, they shared a profound concern that a powerful central government could become increasingly intrusive, and knew that power tends to corrupt. As an antidote, the Constitution they created clearly states that any power not specifically allocated to the federal government remains with the states.\n\nThe problem, and it is not a new one, is that political partisans on each side tend to forget their civics when a political issue of great moment arises for which there is no consensus. On the issue of abortion, which is literally life and death,  the country is deeply divided. For many Americans, it is tantamount to murder. Even more Americans believe it is a matter of personal freedom.\n\nCompromise between those two sides is not easy to find. It requires some to concede that it might not be murder, and others to concede that there can be limitations on personal freedom. There cannot be “half murder.” So, the two sides fight it out.\n\nThe outlines of a political compromise are not difficult to sketch out, although they seem morally unsatisfying. Does an abortion before 15 weeks not take a life? Does that mean one day before 15 weeks does not take a life? That one day after 15 weeks, it does take a life? Think about what took place in those first 15 weeks. Sperm and an egg come together and create an organism that grows into a human life form in 3 1/2 months. Does not abortion during those 15 weeks, like abortion after 15 weeks, end a potential life?\n\nThe polls show that most Americans are abortion moderates, not binary “pro-life” or “pro-choice” absolutists. In one scientific survey after another, it is clear that relatively few people believe abortion should always or never be legal. Nevertheless, and understandably, the abortion issue is viewed quite differently in different states. Abortion, in spite of those polls, is now banned or severely restricted at all stages of pregnancy in 15 states. Both sides should applaud the Supreme Court decision. It is clearly more “small-d” democratic than the rule of law that preceded Dobbs.\n\nThe abortion issue remains high-pitched. Emotional. Divisive. Counterproductive. It has enhanced disrespect for government. The Democratic Party sees the abortion issue as an opportunity to gain votes. The Democrats’ message is that Republican candidates want to diminish your freedoms, that the Supreme Court decision is flawed, that the abortion issue should remain with the federal government.\n\nThis is at a time when the rule of law is under a multifaceted attack. The rule of law is precious. It is vulnerable. It exists more because of compliance than enforcement. For compliance to be effective, to be as universal as possible requires respect for government. Unfortunately, respect for government today is, at least since it has been measured, at an all-time low.\n\nUnfortunately, the heated debate over abortion has contributed to that alienation for half a century, and it’s only getting more partisan. Those who care about other issues other than reproductive rights can do something about it. Candidates for federal office, regardless of their political party, could state clearly what an overwhelming majority of Americans know to be true: that the moral dimensions of abortion are complex, and passionate people of good will are on both sides of the issue. Then they can state, as Nikki Haley has done, their own position on the issue, followed by a realistic assessment of the political realities. That means acknowledging that one law, in one jurisdiction, is not the answer.\n\nDemocrats, particularly those who claim to fear that our democracy is hanging by a thread, do their cause no favor by pretending that they have never heard of the doctrine of federalism. Democrats do damage to the country and their own cause when they demonize Republican political candidates with dishonest attack ads over this issue. Or when they claim they want to enshrine all the elements of Roe v. Wade into federal law while deceiving voters about the elements of that jagged jurisprudence they know are unpopular, such as parental consent.\n\nFor their part, Republicans campaigned for five decades to return this issue to the states. When legislative action and statewide referendums don’t go their way – and they haven’t been – it’s hypocritical to start pushing for a federal ban. And unpopular.\n\nThat this issue is now in the hands of the state could eventually help tone down the abortion issue. It should help all voters recognize the issue is complex, that one law does not fit all, that we are fortunate to have a constitutional government. That the issue properly rests with the states.\n\nNo matter what one believes with regard to abortion, one should also be concerned with preserving the rule of law, with preserving the greatest country in the history of humankind.",

        "articleBody": "We spend too much time, I think, looking through the world with a linear viewpoint.\n\nThis is understandable. I do it myself. In the line of work I'm in, it's inescapable. A story comes up, we read it, report on it, opine about it, and another replaces it in the flow the next hour, or the next day. And in our personal lives, we do this as well; we buy a truck, drive it until the wheels come off, then buy another. A child is born, a child grows up.\n\nBut when we step outside, all of that changes.\n\nToday is the winter solstice. Here in Alaska, that means that the cold, dark part of the year has crested, and tomorrow, we start our journey back towards the sun. This morning, the sun rose at 10:14 AM and will set at 3:41 PM, giving us 5 hours and 27 minutes of full daylight. The sun, today, will make a low arc across the southern horizon; at arm's length (for me at least), the sun won't rise beyond three fingers-width above the horizon. We love the winters here, just as we love the entire year, but the winters in Alaska are not for the faint of heart. While this time of year is beautiful, it's cold. We get snowfalls measured in feet, and now and then, a low-pressure system will park itself offshore in the Gulf of Alaska, pulling air from the Arctic Circle down to the Mat-Su and dropping us into a deep freeze for a while. But we go outside, and the snow is this beautiful, pristine white, the air is crisp, clean, and pure.\n\nThe wheel has turned, though, and we're on our way back towards spring. By April, we'll have days nice enough to sit out on the deck in the sunshine of an afternoon with an adult beverage, listening to the wind in the trees and the first spring birds returning. At that time, we'll be gaining an hour of daylight every 10 days, until late June, when we will enjoy 20 hours of full daylight and, even at 2:00 AM, still in twilight. The wheel turns and turns again, and at that point will start the turn back towards another winter.\n\nHere in the Valley, our neighbors change through the seasons. Some are year-round residents. Look at the photo at the beginning of this piece, and in the upper-left, you see our resident Cooper's Hawk, who occasionally hangs around our bird feeders, looking to pick up a junco or a chickadee. We don't mind; he has to eat, and it is, after all, a bird feeder. Moving clockwise, we have a Boreal Chickadee, a winter visitor that comes down from the Brooks Range when the snow gets deep and the mercury drops. Then we have a red squirrel, which we see mostly in the summer, as winter pushes them back into heavier timber; then a winter visitor, one of the megafaunal species Alaska is famous for, a moose who spends the snow season at lower altitudes, favoring human-plowed roads and parking areas where moving about is easier. And finally, another year-round resident, a Downy Woodpecker, who comes to the suet and punctuates his visit with sharp calls.\n\nThose, here, are typical of our neighbors, and we're richer for their presence.\n\nToday, we begin our move back to the sun. I'm fond of joking that Alaska has four seasons: June, July, August, and winter. But it's not really like that. By late March, the days will be already much longer and sunny afternoons will be lovely for long walks, even as the snow is still melting. We have many lovely days in September and October, favored days for going out after the late salmon runs or into the woods with a shotgun looking for spruce and ruffed grouse. It's all part of that cycle; the salmon come, they spawn, and they die, but their young go to sea, only to return themselves in time. The moose drop calves in the spring, who grow to have calves of their own, and so on.\n\nIt works that way with us, too. Linearly, we can see a baby born, a child grown, educated, married, and on his or her own; but in fact, I can look back to my grandparents, remember them being part of my life, remember all they saw in their years, and one day my grandchildren will think on me the same way. That, too, is a wheel that never stops turning.\n\nSoon, in another such turning, we'll move into a new calendar year. It's fun, by the way, that they are so close together; the solstice marks the end of a natural year, as the calendar marks the end of a human-defined year. 2024 is going to be a big one; it's a presidential election year, and it will be hotly contested, forcing us back into that linear train of thought. But as we move through the trials, tribulations, and frustrations of the news cycle, it's important to step outside now and then, look around, and realize that the rest of the world will spin on. Summer will give way to fall, then winter, then spring, and then summer will come again, as it always does.\n\nTake comfort in that. I do.",

        "articleBody": "The severity to which Democrats and the left suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome continues to amaze us. For Republicans and conservatives, however, watching Democrats every time they try to \"get Trump\" is like watching an endless loop of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote. The Acme Dynamite Company foils them each time, and Donald Trump's poll numbers go up once again. As the 2024 presidential election gets closer, and more speculation arises about Joe Biden being physically and mentally able to run for a second term, Democrats appear to get more desperate. But did the recent Colorado Supreme Court ruling removing Trump's name from the ballot also make them a bit more sloppy? \n\nOn Wednesday, following the ruling, Democrat Senator Chris Coons of Delaware appeared on CNN to discuss the decision by the Colorado high court. While Coons and every other Democrat celebrate the move to essentially disenfranchise millions of Colorado Trump supporters, it was something he said to host Kate Bolduan that should raise the eyebrows of every Republican, whether they support Donald Trump or not. Coons stated that “any action that makes it less likely” for Trump to be reelected should be \"encouraged.\" Any action, Senator?\n\nCoons appeared to perhaps buffer that statement and went on to say that those actions would also include voters who would not vote him back into office in the election,\n\n“Whether it is a court that determines he’s unfit to hold office because he took up force against our Constitution or mobilized a mob against our Constitution, or because the electorate throws him out, I don’t think it really matters. If he’s unfit to hold office we should all be encouraged by any action that makes it less likely that he will return to the presidency.”\n\nSen. Coons may be talking about legal or electoral means to ensure Trump is not reelected, but the actions of his party don't seem to reflect that rational means are as far as they are willing to go. From the minute Trump came down the escalator at Trump Tower in 2015, Democrats have been frantically searching in vain for a way to make him go away. Literally, from the moment after Trump was sworn in, the effort to impeach him had begun. That was quickly followed by Russia collusion and the first impeachment case over a phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump was alleged to have pressured Zelensky into investigating then-former Vice President Joe Biden. Then came January 6, 2021, and Trump's second impeachment alleging he incited an insurrection. Since then, there have been four indictments. Each time, his poll numbers go up.  \n\nThe great Rush Limbaugh, as he did about a lot of things, explained perfectly what it is that is dogging the left. In a 2020 interview with Trump, he pointed out that \"They're (Democrats) able to take out any Republican they choose.\" Limbaugh finished his explanation,\n\n    \"...They haven't stopped you. They can't believe it. They're throwing everything — and so they are doubling down on doing whatever they can to try to get rid of you just to prove that they can, and it's frustrating as heck that they haven't been able to.\" \n\nSo, what are frustrated, desperate Democrats to do? The Colorado ruling may be an indicator of that. If Democrats realize that they cannot stop Trump, is it possible then that they will do the next best thing and stop average Americans, more specifically Trump supporters? Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham took it a step further Wednesday night in an interview with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Ingraham asked Gingrich if he thought Americans would be willing to \"move on\" if the U.S. Supreme Court does not reverse the ruling. Gingrich did not mince words, saying, \"...I think the Democrats are dangerously close to causing the kind of confrontation that would be truly disastrous for the country.\" Gingrich also happened to mention the last time there was an attempt to keep a candidate off the ballot. That was in 1860, when ten states tried to keep Abraham Lincoln off the ballot. If memory serves, that didn't go well for America.\n\nColorado is not alone. There are attempts in six other states to keep Trump off the ballot, with 13 other states where lawsuits have been filed. But if the Supreme Court takes up the Colorado ruling and strikes it down, it would likely mean the end of the other cases as well. If that happens, and Democrats and the left are forced to go back to the drawing board, how far does the bar move, and what other \"actions\" would be \"encouraged?\"",

        "title": "Cardinal Hollerich guides synod with a gentle hand",
        "authors": "Thomas Reese",
        "date": "2023-10-20",
        "articleBody": "Hollerich hopes the synod can develop a road map for worldwide consultation before the next session of the synod in October 2024.\n\nVATICAN CITY (RNS) — Some conservative Catholic commentators believe the Synod on Synodality is being controlled by a cabal of liberal church officials and theologians. The silliness of this conspiracy theory can be seen by observing the gentle way in which Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich has been guiding the work of the synod as the papal-appointed “relator” or moderator for the synod.\n\nPope Francis called the synod to help overcome divisions in the church through prayer, conversation and discernment. The first session of the synod is taking place this October. A second session will occur in October 2024.\n\nHollerich is the 65-year-old archbishop of Luxembourg, whom one observer described as a big teddy bear. Before being appointed archbishop by Pope Benedict XVI in 2011, he was a Jesuit missionary in Japan. As relator, he urges the members of the synod to embrace the process. He raises questions but never imposes answers.\n\nIn welcoming the synodal members to their meeting place, he noted, “We are not sitting in hierarchical order but at round tables, which is a way to foster genuine sharing and authentic discernment.” This, he said, “mirrors the experience of the people of God along the synodal path that started in 2021.”\n\nThis synod, which includes lay men and women, is strikingly different from previous synods that only included bishops.\n\n“None of us is a star in this synod,” Hollerich said. Rather the Holy Spirit is the protagonist of the synod. “Only with a heart fully open to the Spirit’s guidance will we be able to respond to the call we have received as synod members.”\n\nThe cardinal described the church as “the people of God, walking through history, with Christ in her midst,” which does not exclude disagreements in this crowd.\n\n“It is only normal that there is a group walking at his right, another at his left, while some run ahead and others lag behind,” explains Hollerich. “When each of these groups looks at Christ our Lord, together with him they cannot help but see the group that is doing the opposite: those walking on the right will see those walking on the left, those running ahead will see those lagging behind. In other words, the so-called progressive cannot look at Christ without seeing the so-called conservatives with him and vice versa. Nevertheless, the important thing is not the group to which we seem to belong but walking with Christ within his Church.”\n\nHollerich stressed the importance of small-group discussions in the synodal process. Conversation in the Spirit “allows the expression of everyone’s point of view, enhancing consonances without neglecting differences, but above all discouraging polarizations and polemics.”\n\nIt “aims to build consensus without dividing into factions or crushing into uniformity.”\n\nAt the synod, there should not be “a battle between position A and B,” Hollerich told the members. “Through genuine discernment, the Holy Spirit opens our minds and our hearts to new positions, leaving A and B behind!”\n\nHollerich is responsible for introducing each of the four modules or topics listed in the Instrumentum Laboris, or working paper, for discussion in small groups.\n\nThe conversations in the small groups begin with each person having four minutes to communicate what is most important to him or her. The small groups then continue their conversation and discernment.\n\nEventually, each group drafts a two-page report on each module indicating points of convergence and divergence, tensions that have emerged and questions that remain open. The first draft of each report is presented to the full assembly, and then each group finalizes its report after hearing what was said in the assembly.\n\nThese small-group reports will then be used in drawing up a report for the full synod.\n\nFor the first module, Hollerich recommended the small groups reconnect with the experience of the “journeying together” of the people of God over the past two years of preparatory discussions as they occurred in their parishes, dioceses and countries. “Each of us is invited to choose what seems most important and most meaningful, what they feel emerges most strongly from their memory,” he said.\n\n“Our reflection should not take the form of a theological or sociological treatise,” explained the cardinal. “We need to start from concrete experiences, our own personal one and above all the collective experience of the people of God that has spoken through the listening phase.”\n\nListening during these conversations in the Spirit “builds communion and brings missionary dynamism,” according to Hollerich.\n\nIn introducing the second module on “communion,” he suggested the members “focus first on the title ‘A communion that radiates.’” Even more, he said, is the question that immediately follows: “How can we be more fully a sign and instrument of union with God and of the unity of all humanity?”\n\nHe noted, “In deep communion with his Father through the Holy Spirit, Jesus extended this communion to all the sinners. Are we ready to do the same? Are we ready to do this with groups which might irritate us because their way of being might seem to threaten our identity?”\n\nEach of the modules has five worksheets to stimulate conversation, and each of the 35 small groups discussed one of the worksheets. Some critics complained that this kept the members from discussing all the topics, but the members had been polled on their preferences and most were in the small group assigned the worksheet they requested. In addition, during the general congregations or plenary meetings of the synod, time was provided for individual interventions on any topic.\n\nHollerich began his introduction to the third module on “Co-responsibility in Mission” by reminding the synod: “We are part of the same Church, and we share the same mission: to announce to the world the Good News of the Gospel, the love and mercy of God toward all humanity and indeed all creation.”\n\nThe question asked of the synod in this module is: “How can we better share gifts and tasks in the service of the Gospel?”\n\nHollerich spoke of how communion (the topic of the second module) and mission (third module) are interrelated. “Communion is not closed in on itself but is impelled toward mission; at the same time, the purpose of mission is precisely to extend the scope of communion, enabling more and more people to meet the Lord and accept his call to be part of his people.”\n\nThe mission of the church is to proclaim the Gospel, said Hollerich, which includes “the commitment to integral ecology, the struggle for justice and peace, the preferential option for the poor and the peripheries, and the willingness to be open to encounter with all.”\n\nThis module also raised the question, “How can we ensure that women feel they are an integral part of this missionary Church?”\n\nThe fourth module dealt with “Participation, governance and authority. What processes, structures and institutions are there in a missionary synodal Church?”\n\n“Missionary discipleship and co-responsibility are not just catchphrases,” asserted Hollerich, “but a call that we can only realize together, with the support of concrete processes, structures and institutions that truly work in the spirit of synodality.” This can impact the life of the church at every level.\n\nHollerich noted here the dangers of clericalism. “Where clericalism reigns, there is a Church that does not move, a Church without mission,” he said. “Clericals only want to maintain the ‘status quo,’ because only the ‘status quo’ cements their power. Mission then is impossible!”\n\nRather the challenge is to bring synodality through conversations in the Spirit and discernment to local church structures.\n\nAs a member of the committee drafting the final report, Hollerich will certainly have influence, but this report will have to be reviewed and approved by the full synod. It is unlikely that this report will make final recommendations on controversial items. Rather it will set the stage for further discussion in the local churches.\n\nHollerich’s hope is that the synod “can develop a road map for the following year” of worldwide consultation before the next session of the synod in October 2024. “Ideally this road map should indicate where we feel consensus has been reached among us and above all within the people of God, laying down possible steps to undertake as a response to the voice of the Spirit. But it should also say where deeper reflection is needed and what could help that process of reflection.”\n\nIt is difficult to understand how the critics of the synodal process can see in Hollerich a Machiavellian figure trying to control the synod. The process allows many opportunities for members to speak and express their views. As moderator of the synod, he has been very moderate.",

        "authors": "Thomas Reese",
        "date": "2023-10-04",
        "articleBody": "The world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point, says the pope, but our response has been inadequate.\n\nVATICAN CITY (RNS) — The pope is not happy.\n\nEight years after the release of “Laudato Si’,” his encyclical on the environment, there’s been little progress on addressing the issue of global warming. And few people seem to care. \n\nIn his new apostolic exhortation, “Laudate Deum” — which translates as “Praise God” —  released Wednesday (Oct. 4), Francis writes that “our responses have not been adequate, while the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point.”\n\nHe also takes on climate change deniers — those who “deny, conceal, gloss over or relativize the issue, the signs of climate change” and deny the cause is the use of fossil fuels.\n\nAs he did in his earlier encyclical, Pope Francis begins by taking a serious look at what scientists are telling us about the causes and consequences of global warming.\n\nHe notes that the overwhelming majority of scientists specializing in the climate agree that there is a correlation between global warming and “the accelerated increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly since the mid-twentieth century.”\n\nThe pope supports this assertion with scientific data.\n\n“The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which causes global warming, was stable until the nineteenth century, below 300 parts per million in volume,” he writes. \n\nFrancis adds: “While I was writing Laudato Si’, they hit a historic high — 400 parts per million — until arriving at 423 parts per million in June 2023. More than 42% of total net emissions since the year 1850 were produced after 1990.”\n\nAt the same time, “in the last fifty years the temperature has risen at an unprecedented speed, greater than any time over the past two thousand years. In this period, the trend was a warming of 0.15° C per decade, double that of the last 150 years. From 1850 on, the global temperature has risen by 1.1° C.\n\n“At this rate,” he concludes, “it is possible that in just ten years we will reach the recommended maximum global ceiling of 1.5° C.”\n\nThis will be disastrous.\n\n“We know that every time the global temperature increases by 0.5° C,” he writes, “the intensity and frequency of great rains and floods increase in some areas and severe droughts in others, extreme heat waves in some places and heavy snowfall in others.”\n\nBut this is just the beginning.\n\n“If up to now we could have heat waves several times a year, what will happen if the global temperature increases by 1.5° C, which we are approaching? Those heat waves will be much more frequent and with greater intensity. If it should rise above 2 degrees, the icecaps of Greenland and a large part of Antarctica will melt completely, with immensely grave consequences for everyone.”\n\nThe pope describes how desperate the situation is. “Some effects of the climate crisis are already irreversible, at least for several hundred years, such as the increase in the global temperature of the oceans, their acidification and the decrease of oxygen.”\n\nBut things will get worse.\n\n“We are approaching a critical point,” he says. There is the possibility that what we are doing now will precipitate a cascade of events leading to “the reduction of ice sheets, changes in ocean currents, deforestation in tropical rainforests and the melting of permafrost in Russia.” If this happens, “no intervention will be able to halt a process once begun.”\n\nThe pope condemns those who want to blame this problem on the poor who are having too many babies. It is richer countries that have caused this problem, not the poor.\n\nThe pope notes that “emissions per individual in the United States are about two times greater than those of individuals living in China, and about seven times greater than the average of the poorest countries.” To have a significant long-term impact on the problem, Francis calls for “a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model.”\n\nHe also takes on those who claim that reducing the use of fossil fuels and developing cleaner energy sources will cost jobs. He argues that “the transition to renewable forms of energy, properly managed, as well as efforts to adapt to the damage caused by climate change, are capable of generating countless jobs in different sectors.”\n\nThe pope blames what is happening on economic greed and the technocratic paradigm that believes “reality, goodness and truth automatically flow from technological and economic power as such.” He repeats what he said in “Laudato Si’”: “our immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human responsibility, values and conscience.”\n\nWhile “we have made impressive and awesome technological advances,” he writes, “we have not realized that at the same time we have turned into highly dangerous beings, capable of threatening the lives of many beings and our own survival.”\n\nFrancis complains that “The mentality of maximum gain at minimal cost, disguised in terms of reasonableness, progress and illusory promises, makes impossible any sincere concern for our common home and any real preoccupation about assisting the poor and the needy discarded by our society.”\n\nThe international community has not responded adequately to the crisis. “Despite the many negotiations and agreements,” he notes, “global emissions continue to increase.”\n\n“We know that at this pace in just a few years we will surpass the maximum recommended limit of 1.5° C and shortly thereafter even reach 3° C, with a high risk of arriving at a critical point,” he writes.\n\n“Even if we do not reach this point of no return,” he continues, “it is certain that the consequences would be disastrous and precipitous measures would have to be taken, at enormous cost and with grave and intolerable economic and social effects. Although the measures that we can take now are costly, the cost will be all the more burdensome the longer we wait.”\n\nThe pope calls for binding international commitments for energy transition that are “efficient, obligatory and readily monitored.” The process must be “drastic” and “intense” with the commitment of all.\n\nFrancis ends by presenting spiritual motivations for Christians to respond to the climate crisis. He cites Leviticus 25, where God says, “the land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants.” He notes that Jesus “was in constant touch with nature” and invites us “to be attentive to the beauty that there is in the world.”\n\n“The world sings of an infinite Love: how can we fail to care for it?” he asks.",

        "title": "To beat Trump, Nikki Haley tries to expand coalition, and fast",
        "authors": "Gram Slattery",

        "articleBody": "CLEAR LAKE, Iowa, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley has risen in opinion polls in recent months largely on the back of college-educated, affluent, suburban professionals, many of whom have tired of Donald Trump's caustic rhetoric and legal troubles.\n\nIf the former South Carolina governor is to ascend any further and have a real shot at beating Trump in the 2024 Republican nominating contest, supporters and opponents say, she must expand that coalition - and quickly.\n\nThat means pulling in more voters who live in rural areas, are middle- or working-class, or lack college degrees, according to eight pollsters and strategists interviewed by Reuters. Some are affiliated with the Haley nomination effort and some are independent.\n\nAhead of the Republican nominating kick-off in Iowa on Jan. 15, Haley has been traveling to Trump-friendly territory in the state, including a December campaign swing that took her through a deeply conservative area along its northern border.\n\nShe also launched a \"Farmers for Nikki\" coalition in November, while her campaign and its allies have blanketed the airwaves with ads in rural areas in an effort to build her name recognition and broaden her appeal.\n\nIn a barn with hand-hewn wooden beams in Spirit Lake and at a Clear Lake restaurant where a mounted bison head loomed large, Haley spoke this month about the small South Carolina town where she grew up that had only two traffic lights\n\n\"The area I grew up in was much like Iowa,\" Haley told an audience in the town of Sioux Center. \"I grew up playing in a cotton field and in a dairy farm.\"\n\nShe talked at length about shortcomings in the public healthcare system for America's veterans, which caters disproportionately to rural Americans. While she has stepped up her criticisms of Trump in recent months, saying that his management style is too chaotic and divisive to be effective, she did not bring up the former president much on the trail.\n\nTrump leads his Republican rivals in Iowa with about 50% support, polls show. Haley, who was U.N. ambassador under Trump, is in a close third place behind Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Her numbers have moved up in recent weeks while DeSantis, once seen as a serious threat to Trump, has faltered.\n\nLes Hardy, a truck driver at a local chick hatchery, braved bone-cold conditions to attend Haley's town hall in Clear Lake. He arrived undecided about which candidate to back, but said he was considering Trump.\n\nAfter the event, Hardy said he was leaning toward Haley thanks to her straightforward answers to audience questions and what he described as her \"down home\" manner.\n\nMost of his co-workers, however, stood behind the former president. \"Trump is definitely number 1 in the majority of their eyes,\" Hardy said. \"But number 2, it's anybody's race.\"\n\nROOM TO RISE\n\nIn a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in December, Trump led the Republican field nationally with 61% support, while Haley and DeSantis both stood at 11%. The winner of the Republican primary will take on Democratic President Joe Biden in November 2024.\n\nHaley scooped up around a fifth of college-educated Republicans, while also outperforming among suburbanites. About seven-in-10 Republicans without a college degree backed Trump.\n\nInternal polling from SFA, one of the outside PACs supporting Haley, also indicates she is outperforming in high-income, college-educated and suburban areas, according to an official there, who requested anonymity to discuss private polling and campaign strategy.\n\nThat official said Haley has room to grow with rural and non-college voters as they start paying more attention to the presidential race and become more familiar with her candidacy.\n\nSFA has spent more than $25 million on ads and mailings backing her White House run since late September, when Haley began gaining serious traction among some major donors, and mid-December, according to disclosures made to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nOne recent spot by SFA focused on the struggles of the middle class, lamenting that \"the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.\"\n\n\"Nikki isn't taking any voter for granted,\" said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a campaign spokesperson. \"She's traveling across Iowa holding town halls, answering every question and shaking every hand.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, which will hold its primary a week after the Iowa caucuses and is a significantly more affluent state, Haley is in a clear second, behind Trump. In an internal poll conducted in mid-December and shared with Reuters by AFP Action, a political advocacy organization supporting Haley, she is statistically tied with Trump in a theoretical head-to-head match up there.\n\nDeSantis campaign officials say Haley would fail to beat Trump in a one-on-one race because she does not appeal to voters who still admire the former president.\n\nInterviews with 20 people at Haley's events in northwestern Iowa showed she was drawing some voters who were ready to move on from Trump, along with some still willing to consider him.\n\nOf the 10 who wanted to move on, all were leaning toward Haley. Of the 10 who were still open to the former president, some preferred Haley, some preferred DeSantis and others said they would likely stick with Trump.\n\nToni Featherston, a 64-year-old nurse from Rockford, Iowa (pop. 758), said Haley impressed her.\n\nWhile Featherston still likes Trump, she said his legal issues and propensity for making controversial statements that distract from policies make it unlikely he would accomplish everything he set out to achieve in a second term.\n\n\"Haley seems down to earth,\" Featherston said. \"I like Trump, but I agree with Haley. That'd be too much chaos.\"",

        "articleBody": "KYIV, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Polish farmers have ended their blockade of one of the border crossings between Ukraine and Poland and the movement of lorries has been fully restored, the Ukrainian border service said on Sunday.\n\n\"Truck traffic has been restored: Polish farmers have ended the blockade in front of the Medyka - Shehyni crossing,\" the service said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nThe service quoted the Polish border guard as saying that the protest action in front of the crossing ended at 9:30 a.m. Kyiv time (0730 GMT) on Sunday.\n\n\"Registration and crossing of trucks entering Ukraine is carried out as usual,\" it added.\n\nPolish farmers said on Saturday that they would suspend a protest at the crossing with Ukraine from Sunday but truckers would continue blockades at three other crossings over Christmas.\n\nDrivers have been blocking several crossings with Ukraine since Nov. 6, demanding that the European Union reinstate a system under which Ukrainian companies need permits to operate in the bloc, and the same for European truckers seeking to enter Ukraine.\n\nThey were later joined by farmers who demanded government subsidies for corn and no hikes in taxes.\n\nUkraine's deputy prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Thursday that Kyiv hoped to reach an agreement with the new Polish government to end truck blockades at the border crossings.\n\nUkrainian transport analysts have said that about 3,900 trucks were on the Polish side waiting for permission to enter Ukraine.\n\nPoland's newly appointed Prime Minister Donald Tusk said last week that the new government will try to quickly put an end to the truck drivers' protest.",

        "authors": "Kelly Quinlan",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "TAMPA, Fla.- Georgia Tech started slow trailing 14-0 to UCF, but a forced fumble by Horace Lockett in the first quarter provided the spark for Tech to cut into the lead and ultimately the Jackets went on a 27-0 run to put away the Knights 30-17 to win the Gasparilla Bowl and take home hardware for the first time since the 2016 season when Tech won the Gator Bowl over Kentucky.\n\nFirst-year Tech head coach Brent Key finished his first full season with a winning record at 7-6 and picked up the win over the school where he truly began his coaching career and worked from 2006 to 2015 UCF.\n\n“We’ve been up 14-0 in a game and it didn’t come out the way we wanted. I have heard many times not to waste a failure. Georgia Tech is a school that teaches you how to solve problems and push forward. We have to live in the moment and they did that. They kept playing and kept playing,” Key said after the game. “It was really a capsule of our entire season. Learning how to do things the right way. Play for four quarters and to go into every game expecting to win. They kept fighting and good things happened.”\n\nThe win echoed a momentum early in George O’Leary’s tenure as head coach as he finally guided the Jackets to a bowl game after his third season when the Jacket beat West Virginia in the Carquest Bowl and started a run at the top of the ACC with a 7-5 season.\n\nO'Leary who coached at both Tech and UCF was the honorary captain before the game. Much of Key's career has been shaped by O'Leary who is his mentor and former coach and boss.\n\nKey pushed on the question after the game, but the vibe of the program appears to be changing.\n\n“We challenge each other to come in every day and be the best version of ourselves individually and collectively as a team. We are going to enjoy the heck out of this tonight, but then we will be back in January and it is a new team and new comraderies in the locker room,” Key said.\n\n\n\nJamal Haynes took home the Gasparilla Bowl MVP trophy with 128 yards on 18 carries a career-high for him in a game and he passed the 1,000-yard rushing mark on the season with his longest run of the day, a 32-yard run to start the third quarter.\n\nThe 32-yard run saw Haynes become the first Jacket to rush for 1,000 yards in a season since Kirvonte Benson and TaQuon Marshall both hit 1,000 yards in 2017.\n\nHaynes made the transition from slot receiver to running back at the request of the offensive staff making his season special.\n\n“Making the position change wasn’t easy, but it became a lot easier as the season went along. The O-Line does a phenomenal job and work their tails off every game,” he said. “The transition was special, of course you are always gonna have a little doubt about how it's gonna go playing wise but at the end of the day, the coaches believed in me, he told me just put down my head and go to work. And that's exactly what I did.”\n\nSupersenior running back Dontae Smith ran for 65 yards on 16 carries and a touchdown in his final game as a Yellow Jacket.\n\nTech ran 23 straight times to end the day and took the workload off the shoulder of quarterback Haynes King who ended the night with just 13 passing attempts, one touchdown in the air and one interception and just 87 yards passing. However, King did plenty of damage on the ground rolling up 89 yards on 12 carries including his 10th rushing touchdown of the season.\n\nKing’s lone touchdown pass came on a 41-yard strike to Malik Rutherford near the end of the first half that tied the game at 17. He said there was no panic as the Jackets faced a two-score deficit early in the game.\n\n“We’ve been here before, we are not going to press,” King said.\n\nWith his two touchdowns in the game, King set a record for the most touchdowns responsible for in Tech history with 37.\n\n“We got into a possession where you start looking at possessions and time on the clock. You also look at timeouts. We had to eat the clock and Haynes did a great job looking at the clock and snapping it with one second,” Key said.\n\nTech won the time of possession battle 33:30 to 26:30 and the offense was 5-5 in the red zone.\n\n\nTech’s defense allowed 14 points on the first two USF drives of the game and then held the Knights to three points and 149 yards on 14 plays, they gave up 275 yards on the final 53 plays UCF ran in the game. Eight of the final nine UCF drives yielded no points and UCF had two turnovers on downs, a fumble and an interception.\n\nLinebacker Kyle Efford led the Jackets with nine tackles in the game and a quarterback hurry. His counterpart at linebacker Paul Moala added three TFLs and two sacks.\n\nReserve defensive end Noah Collins recorded his first career sack in the win but left the game with an injury on the play.\n\nTech knocked UCF quarterback John Rhys Plumlee out of the game late after he threw for 198 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 32 yards while being sacked three times. Backup Timmy McClain completed one pass to each team.\n\nAhmari Harvey had the interception off McClain and losing an early interception because he stepped out of bounds before touching the ball. Harvey said the defense kept fighting regardless of what happened on the field.\n\n“You will be fined through adversity. You find out who the real man is when their back is against the wall, everything not going their way,” Harvey said.\n\nThe bright spot for UCF on offense was Javon Baker who caught nine passes for 173 yards and a touchdown.\n\nRunning back RJ Harvey ran for 120 yards on 15 carries, but fumbled the ball to change the momentum of the game.\n\nUCF didn’t help themselves as Kobe Hudson dropped a touchdown pass in the end zone that led to a field goal and kicker Colton Boomer missed a 30-yard field goal before halftime and UCF never scored again in the game.\n\n“We had some opportunities in the first half [dropped pass in the end zone and missed field goal]. In the second half, we had trouble getting anything going offensively,” UCF head coach Gus Malzahn said. \n\nGAME SUMMARY\n\nThe opening kickoff was returned to the UCF49 by Xavier Townsend on a 47-yard return. RJ Harvey ran for 20 yards on second down and then Javon Baker caught a 23-yard touchdown to put the Knights up 7-0.\n\nChristian Leary returned the ensuing kickoff 23 yards to the GT23. Leary was called for a false start on the play. Jamal Haynes couldn’t handle an underthrown swing pass, but Haynes ran for 16 yards on the next play to covert. UCF was offsides on the next play to move the ball to the GT39. Zach Pyron entered the game and ran for five yards and a first down. Malik Rutherford lost one yard on a quick pass and then couldn’t haul in the second down pass to set up 3rd and long near midfield. King was flushed and had to throw the ball away. David Shanahan’s punt went 57 yards where Nikai Martinez inexplicably fielded the ball and nearly was caught in the end zone for a safety before getting out to the UCF2.\n\nThe first run was stopped for no gain but a deep show to Baker for 36 yards flipped the field and UCF picked up 14 yards more on the next play to Baker in the air again.

Harvey lost four yards on second down on a Moala TFL, but Kobe Hudson caught a 30-yard pass to flip the field to the GT40. An illegal man downfield wiped out a catch by Hudson. Baker caught an eight-yard pass. Kevin Harris pressured Plumlee to force an errant throw and Plumlee ran for six yards on third down to set up fourth and one at the GT31. Harvey picked up four yards on second down and Lockett jumped offsides to give UCF a first down at the GT14. The Knight picked up four yards on two runs on the next plays. Ahmari Harvey broke up a touchdown pass to Hudson to force a short field goal.\n\nKing hit Eric Singleton Jr. for eight yards on first down and Dylan Leonard trucked a UCF defender for a 29-yard pass and run on the next play. Haynes ran for 9 yards on the next play. Haynes picked up 11 yards after a timeout to the UCF17. King and Haynes each ran once to set up first and goal at the UCF5. King ran for four yards for a touchdown to make it a one-score game 17-10 UCF with 4:23 left in the half.\n\nAfter a touchback, UCF started at their own 25. Plumlee was flushed out of the pocket by the Tech defense on first down and forced to throw the ball away. Plumlee had to throw his second down pass away and then was flushed and forced to throw an errant pass over the middle for a three and out. Rodney Shelley returned the 47-yard punt five yards to the GT33.\n\nKing hit Smith for five yards on a screen pass. King ran for four on second down to set up third and one at the GT42.

Plumlee slid on a scramble to force UCF to use their final timeout. Plumlee held the ball too long on the next play and then threw it away. UCF tried a 30-yard field goal which they missed.\n\nTech started the second half with a 27-yard kick return by Leary to the GT34. Haynes ran for 35 yards on the first carry of the half to hit 1,000 yards rushing on the season. Haynes ran for 10 yards on the next play to the UCF21. Haynes ran for two yards on first down, Smith picked up three and King was stopped short of the sticks on third down and Key opted to kick a 29-yard field goal to give Tech the lead 20-17.\n\nAfter a short kickoff return to the UCF25, the Knights picked up seven yards on first down, but D’Quan Douse had a TFL on second down and it took diving catch from Holler to convert the third down at the UCF36. After a throwaway and a short run, Harvey broke loose for 27 yards before slipping at the GT29. Myles Sims had a PBU on first down on a pass for Holler. Harvey picked up four yards on second down and Baker caught a tipped ball to set up fourth and one. A hold on fourth down set up fourth and 11. Plumlee was pressured and threw an errant pass for a turnover on downs.\n\nJamal Haynes ran two times for 11 yards to the GT41. King threw an interception to Demari Henderson at the UCF25 on a deep shot for Singleton. Key was forced to challenge it after the official did not initiate a review. The review confirmed the call on the field and that gave UCF the ball at their own 25.\n\nHarvey dropped a first-down pass from Plumlee. Harvey picked up 11 yards after juking a Tech defender to the UCF36. Noah Collins sacked Plumlee on second down to set up 3rd and 14, his first career sack.

Smith ran for five yards on first down and Haynes picked up three yards on the next play to set up third and three at the UCF35.

Pyron ran for three yards to end the third quarter with GT leading 20-17. Smith picked up three yards to start the fourth quarter. King was stuffed at the one-yard line. Smith scored on the next play to put Tech up two scores 27-17 with 13:37 left.\n\nAfter a touchback, UCF started at their 25, and Hudson had a false start on first down. Johnny Richardson picked up 12 yards on first down. Efford stuffed Richardson for a yard on the next play. Plumlee picked up the first down with a two-yard run. Harvey picked up one yard on the next play and Plumlee nearly had a pass picked off by Ahmari Harvey who had a foot out of bounds before touching the ball. Moala sacked Plumlee to force a punt.

        "articleBody": "Florida State didn't have the best close in the 2024 cycle, but the 2025 group just picked up a top prospect at his position.\n\nSolomon Thomas\n, the nation's top-ranked guard in the junior class out of Jacksonville (Fla.) Raines, went through with a verbal commitment to Mike Norvell's program on Friday afternoon.\n\nFSU was the first football camp to host Thomas, following his freshman year, and it was there when he built a relationship with the staff and particularly Alex Atkins. From the staff to the city, where he knows several FSU and even FAMU students, Tallahassee has long felt like home.\n\n\"What coach Norvell is building and what coach Atkins is building, I believe in that process,\" Thomas told Rivals. \"They've kept it real with me from the jump. They've never sold me a dream. They've been honest from the jump.\"\n\nThe program's College Football Playoff snub also factored into the decision, believe it or not.\n\n\"I knew I really wanted to commit to Florida State when I found out they weren't getting into the playoffs,\" he said. \"It kind of hurt me. For a recruit, that's a sign...everybody is looking at you and you're upset over a school that you're not even committed to yet.\n\n\"So I realized I liked Florida State more than everybody else.\"\n\nMore than 30 programs offered a scholarship to Thomas, but other elements of the process continued to point to the Seminoles. Everything in the last few weeks has pushed Thomas to make the commitment decision early.\n\n\"Florida State just stuck out to me,\" he said. \"I was the type of player that was always doubted as a child, so I like to make people eat their words. So when I saw that (playoff snub), there was something new to fight for.\n\n\"I really do feel like Florida State can win a national championship in the next two to three years.\"\n\nThe personal approach of Atkins, going against the grain compared to many of the pitches Thomas has heard to this point, also stood out.\n\n\"Coach Atkins told me one day and was like, 'I don't need you, but I want you. I like your mindset, I like the way you carry yourself.' But when he said he didn't need me, he said he could get somebody else and make them look exactly like me,\" Thomas said. \"He wants me to be the face of his offensive line. And I like that. No coach has told me that on this college level.\n\n\"Everybody says they want me and need me, but not coach Atkins.\"\n\nThomas is the third verbal commitment for FSU in the class of 2025, joining fellow Jacksonville native and blue-chip quarterback Tramell Jones\nas well as in-state defender Ethan Pritchard\n.\nThe newest Nole likes the direction of the class and plans to help build it going forward.\n\n\"To the 2025 class, time for us to get the number one recruiting class!\" Thomas said.",

        "date": "2023-12-11",
        "articleBody": "Six women now accuse famed former KROQ DJ and club owner Rodney Bingenheimer of molesting them when they were underage\n\nOur years before she co-founded the beloved New Wave group the Go-Go’s, guitarist Jane Wiedlin was about 15 years old living with her parents in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. It was around 1974, and she was enamored with glam-rock titans like David Bowie and Marc Bolan. Looking to get as close to the music as possible, she went to the hottest club in L.A.: Rodney Bingenheimer’s English Disco.\n\nThe club — which opened its doors in 1972 — had built a reputation as a well-known haunt for Bowie, Bolan, Iggy Pop, Keith Moon, the New York Dolls, Led Zeppelin, and even Elvis Presley, and it popularized England’s glam rock movement in the United States. But the Disco arguably became as known for its underage female clientele, who came there to dance, listen to music, and meet rock stars. It was here where several of rock’s most famous groupies like the GTOs, Sable Starr, and Lori Mattix would hold court. \n\nWiedlin and several other high school friends  — among those who christened themselves the “Hollywooders”  — hung out there frequently, sneaking out of their parents’ homes to drive to West Hollywood’s Sunset Strip and changing into their club outfits behind the Disco outside. One night, Wiedlin alleges, the club’s eponymous owner — the famed former KROQ DJ and rock-star liaison Rodney Bingenheimer — approached her, isolated her in one of the club’s back rooms, and sexually assaulted her.\n\n“I remember [the room] being very dark and cold,” Wiedlin tells Rolling Stone. “I was a virgin. I didn’t have much experience with boys; boys tended to ignore me…. He picked me out that night. I didn’t know what was going to happen before, but he started rubbing against me with his crotch against my crotch. I didn’t know what to do; I was pretty much frozen. I didn’t say anything; I didn’t try to stop him.”\n\nWiedlin alleges that Bingenheimer, who would have been around 27, told her to remove her belt as it was “getting in the way,” at which point she claims he continued to rub his crotch against her before he ejaculated on her clothes. (Wiedlin wrote about the experience during a chapter of X vocalist John Doe’s 2016 book, Under the Big Black Sun. Bingenheimer wasn’t named at the time, though Wiedlin confirms to Rolling Stone she was writing about the DJ.)",

        "articleBody": "That Sports Illustrated debacle is only the start of a massive disruption of the journalism industry\n\n For journalists who work — or used to work — at G/O Media, the disclaimer at the bottom of numerous articles on the company’s e-commerce site, The Inventory, offers an unsettling vision of the future: “This article was generated by an AI engine which may produce inaccurate information.”  \n\nThat warning appears on every article credited to “The Inventory Bot,” a highly productive virtual employee with its byline on 10 articles published on December 14th alone. “It’s absolutely the most inane way to announce that your article is trash, like pure garbage,” says a former G/O writer who lost their job in a recent round of human-employee layoffs. “There’s no thought process going on behind this except, ‘we want as many articles on our site as possible as quickly as possible. And we don’t give a shit about the content.'” (A G/O spokesperson emphasizes that The Inventory “is an e-commerce site, separate and apart from our other editorial properties.”) The former G/O writer doesn’t blame the advent of AI for his own layoff, but there have been some job losses at the company due to automation: The entire staff of Gizmodo en Español was replaced by a years-old translation tool in August, according to the spokesperson.\n\nG/O Media at least labels its robo-content. A more venerable brand, Sports Illustrated, became the face of AI-journalism calamity in recent weeks after publishing what were reported to be AI-written articles attributed to nonexistent people, complete with AI-generated headshots. (The articles came from a third-party company, Advon Commerce. SI’s parent company, Arena Group, says the vendor told them the articles were human-written, albeit with fake bylines and photos. The outlet Futurism, which broke the news about the articles, quoted a newsroom source insisting at least some of the text was AI-generated, as well.) Four Arena Group executives, including the CEO, Ross B. Levinsohn, were fired after the scandal, though an Arena Group spokesperson says the timing was coincidental and related to ownership changes. \n\n“Journalism is going to change more in the next three or five years than it has in the last 30 years.”\n The true possibilities of generative AI began to reveal themselves to the world beyond Silicon Valley in 2023, leaving many industries either bracing for disruption, jumping on the technology as rapidly as possible, or both. The business of news is no exception, with multiple outlets embarrassing themselves this year by using AI tools they either didn’t prompt correctly or weren’t yet up to the tasks at hand: CNET found itself forced to correct errors in over half of 77 AI-generated articles they posted; Microsoft’s MSN highlighted fake news stories after abandoning human curators for an AI-powered homepage; Gannett had to stop using an automated news-writing company, LedeAI, that kept inserting the phrase “close encounter of the athletic kind” into high-school sports stories. \n\n“These tools have a tendency to mess up, to get facts wrong, to hallucinate, to spread misinformation, even when they think it’s right,” says Jack Brewster, enterprise editor for the watchguard organization Newsguard. \n\nGenerative AI is “not quite there yet to be an autopilot,” adds Brad Weitz, CEO of Data Skrive , which has been using human-guided machine-learning technology to generate hundreds of sports stories a week for outlets including the Associated Press, ESPN, and USA Today since 2018 or so — without causing any significant controversy.  Similarly, outlets including the AP and Bloomberg have been utilizing pre-ChatGPT AI tools for years to generate straightforward stories on earnings reports and stock market status updates. “It’s not going to replace humans for an extended period of time,” Weitz says. “We look at it as, can we use this type of technology to make humans more efficient?”\n\nStill, the micro-scandals of 2023 are just a few stray drops of water from an impending flood that may well reshape an entire industry. “Journalism is going to change more in the next three or five years than it has in the last 30 years,” argues David Caswell, formerly of the BBC and Yahoo!, and now founder of StoryFlow Ltd., a AI-in-news consulting firm. Caswell’s extensive experience is on the technology side of the news business, rather than editorial, and his current line of work offers obvious incentive to predict radical change, but he’s far from alone in his assessment. Near-instantaneous automated rewrites of news stories by competing sites and newly AI-equipped search engines alike could cause job losses and potentially devastating decreases in traffic and profits; the proliferation of AI news sites indistinguishable from real ones, sometimes with completely fake stories, seems fated to further erode public trust in journalism – and even any remaining societal sense of shared truths.  \n\nIn the past month, developments have begun to speed up. The New York Times hired an editorial director of Artificial Intelligence Initiatives. German news giant Axel Springer (owner of U.S. publications Politico and Business Insider) struck a deal with ChatGPT creators OpenAI that will allow ChatGPT to offer “real-time news” when answering users’ questions. Semafor spotted Investing.com allegedly rewriting competitors’ news articles with AI and without credit — one of many recent developments that augur an era where AI-powered sites routinely rewrite human-reported scoops. (A spokesperson for Investing.com says the company is “working on and implementing an AI product to assist its editorial team… Investing.com has access to a wide array of financial instruments and is often generating its data from the same sources as other publishers in the industry. It is transparent and responsible in its development and use of AI, clearly specifying when it is deployed to assist its content team.” ) \n\n A startup called Channel1.ai debuted a proof-of-concept episode of a newscast starring AI-generated anchors. Apple reportedly opened talks with a long list of major publishers, offering massive payouts in exchange for using their content to train their AI systems. And Wall Street reiterated its bullishness about AI’s future, with J.P. Morgan excitedly predicting “mass-scale white collar job realignment” that will impact “content creators” — which could become a self-fulfilling prophecy as investors in media properties push for AI adoption.\n\nPerhaps even more consequentially, big tech‘s own use of AI loomed as an ominous external threat to publishers, with new forms of search preventing readers from even reaching their sites. Multiple executives at major publishers told the Wall Street Journal last week that the AI-powered search that Google is slowly rolling out could devastate traffic by drawing from their content to answer users’ questions – without directing them to external links. Even as Axel Springer struck its deal with OpenAI, its chairman and CEO, Mathias Döpfner, told the WSJ that “AI and large language models have the potential to destroy journalism and media brands as we know them.”\n\nLIKE MANY NEWS OUTLETS, Sports Illustrated is under significant financial pressure, which likely left management willing to “try anything,” according to a source familiar with the publication and the broader media business. “I know the tenor of the feeling of the newsroom is that Arena doesn’t care about the quality of the content,” he says. “If it takes pennies to produce and it makes you a quarter, then it’s a return, right?” (An Arena Group spokesperson pointed back to its statement denying the use of AI.)\n\n At G/O media, the former writer recalls the first AI-generated articles appearing — without human editorial input — on the company’s sites within a week of a memo announcing that the company would be experimenting with the technology. “We saw a couple of AI articles in our back end… and then they got published without really any of us knowing,” the writer says. “It was very, very fast. We didn’t look at it. We didn’t get a chance. We didn’t edit it. We didn’t touch it. And almost as soon as it went up, we realized just how bad it was. And our editor-in-chief was like, ‘please send all the corrections you have,’ and it took us 30 minutes to an hour for all of us collectively to nitpick this absurd AI-generated article that none of us had any say in.” (The G/O Media spokesperson claims the writers’ union refused to help with the company’s AI experiments, and says the first article the company posted was “just a list about Star Wars” on Gizmodo.)\n\nJustin Harvey, co-founder and CEO of the startup Infobot.AI, which aims to provide custom AI-powered newsfeeds to readers, sees existing news organizations as mostly focused on using AI to cut costs — and, potentially, workers. “They’re trying to take their existing newsroom and just expand the margins, like, ‘How do we get rid of some of the people? How do we make it more efficient?’ In his mind, that gives startups like his own more room to pioneer newsgathering innovations, like using AI to examine and find newsworthy material in public records — everything from city council meetings to S.E.C. filings — at a scale no human could match. (At the same time, Harvey admits he has no idea yet how the company will turn its product into profits.) One of the hottest startups in the space is Instagram founder Kevin Systrom’s app Artifact, which uses AI as a headline-recommendation tool, as well as  — more boldly — to re-write “clickbait” headlines.  \n\nSome smaller news sites have also found room to be innovative. Rappler, based in the Philippines, won an international AI-journalism competition in November thanks to TLDR, a project that used AI to reformat their news stories into shorter and more visually driven alternate formats to appeal to younger and more text-averse users. As Caswell sees it, that kind of easy reformatting of outlets’ reporting is one of the most promising uses of AI for news organizations.”It’s not a completely automated thing,” says Caswell, who coached the company as part of the competition. “But it vastly steps up the scale at which they can do it.”\n\nOther small outlets have popped up that appear to be purely exploitative, and they’re likely just the beginning. Newsguard has identified more than 600 “unreliable AI-generated news and information websites” this year, some of which publish entirely false articles to garner traffic, including erroneous obituaries for celebrities.  \n\nThe number of such sites will almost certainly “grow exponentially over the next few years,” says Newsguard’s Brewster. “We’ll see thousands by next year. I mean, what’s stopping a Super PAC from using artificial intelligence to start its own website that looks like local news and generates content that’s favorable for whatever political candidate it’s backing? It just lowers the barrier to entry for spreading misinformation. You have the power of thousands of writers at your disposal.”  \n\n It’s also probable that higher-profile, better-funded news sites will pop up to take advantage of large language models’ skill at summarization and paraphrasing to near-instantly grab breaking news stories reported by human journalists elsewhere and post aggregated versions — which, if done at large enough scale, could cannibalize the traffic and profits that fund actual newsgathering. “Someone’s going to just come out and say, ‘All right, fine, I’m just going to create a completely 100 percent AI-driven news site and have zero editors or anything on staff,” predicts Eddie Kim, founder of the news-metrics site Memo.\n\nSuch a site could release “a paraphrased version of an article with just the information that’s in the article, two minutes after their competitor publishes their scoop,” says Caswell. “It’s morally reprehensible, but it’s legal because you can’t copyright the facts… You pay a lot of money as a news organization for your reporters and your infrastructure to do original reporting. And then, five minutes after it gets published, it’s used as raw material, without payment for a consumer experience somewhere else. These are major, major, structural changes.” The kind of AI-powered search Google is starting to use is alarming publishers because it presents exactly the same problem, without even involving another news brand. If customers get used to learning about the news by asking a chatbot or search engine questions and getting customized answers, the roles of news organizations and journalists seem destined to change dramatically.\n\nAt the same time, some existing news organizations may end up turning over some of their own aggregation to AI. The question is whether that will free up staff to do more original work, or if — in an ever-brutal business — that simply means eventually replacing some human workers with automation. There are some signs that at least top organizations will choose the former road. Bloomberg, the Associated Press, and more recently, the Wall Street Journal’s long standing use of pre-ChatGPT tools has expanded their output seemingly without negative impact on their human staffing.\n\nSays the former G/O writer, “If you were basically able to tell writers, ‘You don’t have to do aggregated content anymore. We have an AI bot to take care of that. Instead, you guys should focus on voicey pieces, reported pieces and investigations,’ I think that would be that positive in a lot of ways.”\n\nAI CAN REWRITE TEXT INSTANTLY and absorb and summarize documents faster than any human, but it can’t yet jump on a phone call or Zoom for even the most basic interviews, can’t work a network of sources, can’t trail a subject for an in-depth feature. “Things that are truly investigative, or things that require someone to speak to primary sources” are likely insulated for now from AI-driven change, says Kim. That said, news organizations that fund that kind of work also rely on scale and profits partially generated by aggregated work that may become harder to monetize. And outlets “whose current product is largely built on packaging commodity information” are likely to struggle the most in the coming world, as Caswell recently wrote.  \n\n Even Channel1, the company planning custom newscasts with AI anchors, recognizes the limits  and dangers of journalism without human intervention. “At a base level, this technology is terrifying,” says Channel 1 co-founder Adam Mosam, acknowledging the risks of totally convincing footage of nonexistent news anchors. “We’re hoping to get out in front of this inevitable future and create best practices for the world that we’re moving toward.” \n\nFor Channel1, only a portion of news scripts will be AI-written, with the rest provided through partnerships (they expect to announce one next month with a major news organization), and their own human staff. “We are AI native, as opposed to 100 percent AI,” says Mosam. “And the difference is we have people at every stage of the newsroom.”\n\nFor now, LLMs struggle with some basic journalistic tasks — try to get OpenAI’s GPT-4 to edit a transcript of an interview into a clean Q+A, and you’ll find that it’s quietly rewritten quotes, or simply invented new ones. Some researchers argue that a certain amount of “hallucination” — as the AI’s inventions are known — will always be necessary to allow for creativity in these models. But it’s clear that drawing any conclusions from current limitations is a mistake.\n\n“People generally overestimate what the system can do now and underestimate what it can do in 10 years,” says Infobot’s Harvey. “People probably overestimate what it can do now by 20% or something, and they underestimate what it’s gonna be able to do in the future by 10,000 percent. But probably most people can’t even begin to grapple with the concept of where this is going. ”",

        "articleBody": "A competitive Pokémon expert’s serious critique of Ash Ketchum’s career as a Pokémon trainer.\n\nAsh Ketchum and his rival, Gladion, were down to just one Pokémon each in the finals of the inaugural Alola league. All their friends and family watched in tense anticipation to see who would clinch victory with one final knockout.\n\nBoth sides released their Lycanrocs, though each was a different form of the same species. Ash’s was lithe, poised like a wolf ready to hunt. Gladion’s stood on its hind legs, strong and brimming with energy. The battle would come down to which trainer could better use what was essentially the same Pokémon.\n\nGladion ordered his Lycanroc to send out wave after wave of rocky spires toward Ash’s, which dodged them in the ring as it searched for an opening. Ash told it to get in close and strike with a high-speed dash called an Accelerock, but Gladion’s Pokémon used Counter to strike back with twice the power.\n\nThe two Pokémon traded blows until they were both on the verge of exhaustion. With one final Accelerock, Ash’s Lycanroc powered through another Stone Edge from Gladion’s to attempt a finishing blow. And while Gladion’s Lycanroc was ready with another Counter, Ash ordered his Pokémon to use a counter attack of its own. The crowd watched, stunned, as Gladion’s Lycanroc went flying out of the ring and fainted.\n\nAsh won the battle. He had won many tournament matches before, but this one was different. After 22 years, seven regional leagues and many close calls, he was finally a champion. With cheers roaring in his ears, he stood with his mouth open, tasting absolute victory for the first time as a career of failures melted away.\n\nThe Pokémon anime is fictional, but many real-life fans who grew up watching Ash’s journey shared his happiness. They had spent more than two decades watching him struggle to claim a league win, and the more knowledgeable knew that many of his struggles were self-inflicted, the result of suboptimal decisions and a poor grasp of strategy. A trainer with Ash’s experience should, for example, know that ground-type Pokémon are immune to electric-type attacks, or that fully evolved Pokémon are mostly stronger than their earlier forms.\n\nAfter all, a large portion of the anime’s viewers have beaten multiple Pokémon leagues in the video games, employing the same skills they knew that Ash, for all of his training and experience, should possess. After years of watching the show knowing that they could battle circles around Ash, they finally got to see him live up to their expectations. For anyone who understands Pokémon battles in the non-anime world, his triumph was a relief after years of relentless frustration.\n\nBut does winning his first league truly vindicate Ash as a trainer? Can we ignore the years of missteps? The only proper way to evaluate him is to compare his track record, and its context, against the scores of competitive Pokémon trainers who have won tournaments playing the video game. By applying a basic understanding of competitive Pokémon, it’s time to finally determine just how good Ash really is.\n\nHow Pokémon training works outside the anime\n\nIt’s easy to look down on Ash’s performance. After all, he has lost so many Pokémon league tournaments that even The Pokémon Company International dedicated an entire article to his failures.\n\nThe comparison is even more bleak when stacked against competitive Pokémon trainers, who use every ounce of the community’s accumulated knowledge to reach skill levels that would blow the minds of the anime’s characters.\n\nBut before delving into that body of knowledge, it’s important to distinguish the two kinds of competitive Pokémon, which are very different.\n\nThe first is the competitive singles community, which pits teams of six Pokémon in battles just like you see in the games, with one Pokémon on the field at a time. These players mostly congregate at Smogon.com, a community and resource for Pokémon that groups monsters into tiers based on their usage in online battles. By dividing Pokémon up in this way, it’s easy to see who some of the lesser-used monsters can viably compete against, letting trainers know when they can actually use their weaker, but beloved, Pokémon.\n\nSmogon’s tiers are unofficial, but they are the most widely recognized. The site also holds frequent leagues and tournaments that have their own specialized rules for trainers to test their mettle.\n\nThen there is the official Video Game Championship series, which adds more depth to the Pokemon formula. VGC matches are double battles, in which trainers pick four of their six Pokémon before every battle and use two at a time. Matches are also best-of-three, giving players chances to adapt to initial mistakes. Compared to single battles, double battles allow for much more strategy. \n\nBoth styles of Pokémon battles create their own metagames — that is, a shared understanding of the strongest strategies at a given time. These strategies evolve as trainers adapt or devise counters to the most dominant teams, and spread through the Pokemon community thanks to the internet. Many competitive teams are composed of the same Pokemon as a result, in stark contrast to the teams constructed by trainers in the anime.\n\nBut there’s more to team building than just picking the right battle roster. Some competitive trainers have much of the process down to a science, but it can be as complex as any physics problem. In fact, there are so many decisions to make when building a team that many competitive trainers will recommend that new players use someone else’s team while learning the ropes. Starting from scratch can be overwhelming.\n\nTo start, each Pokémon is born with a certain nature that affects the growth of their six stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed. Based on a Pokémon’s intended role in battle, trainers must breed their Pokémon until each member has an ideal nature. Fortunately, the latest game, Pokémon Sword and Shield, has made finding the right nature easier thanks to mints, a new item that changes the effect nature has on a Pokémon’s stats.\n\nPokémon also have individual values, which range from 1-31, and act like genes. When combined with base stats, trainers can calculate a Pokemon’s potential at certain levels. However, these values are randomly generated without the help of certain in-game items, and Pokémon are usually only considered competitively viable if they have maximum IVs in every stat. This means trainers also breed every member of their team until they are essentially “genetically perfect.”\n\nPokémon also accumulate additional stat bonuses called effort values in battle. These allow trainers to tweak their team on an even more granular level, so that two Pokémon of the same species, with the same nature and the same IVs, can have slightly different stats.\n\nTrainers must also pick each Pokémon’s four available moves. While there is always some variance among teams considering the many attack options available, the competitive community has generally figured out which moves are worth considering. All of these factors — stats, IVs EVs and moves — boil down into sets. Whether custom made or borrowed from others, sets are templates for how competitive trainers talk about Pokémon.\n\nAll of this illustrates the gap between competitive trainers and Ash. While he certainly puts thought into what Pokémon to use in a given battle, he has never gone to such lengths when building a team, nor does he have the resources to do so.\n\nThe problem with evaluating Ash\n\nIn a vacuum, Ash looks like a chump next to any competitive Pokémon trainer. But after a deep examination of the differences between the games and the anime, it’s clear how unfair that comparison is.\n\nAfter all, competitive Pokémon operates in an idealized version of the anime’s world. Trainers have access to any Pokémon at any time (including legendary Pokémon) and can whip them into fighting shape mere hours after hatching. There is also a deeply interconnected community that regularly exchanges information about best practices based on a cumulatively staggering number of Pokémon battles.\n\nAsh, on the other hand, only has access to the Pokémon around him as he goes on his adventure. He certainly doesn’t have the time nor means to breed Pokémon in search of the perfect specimen. He can also forget about using legendary Pokémon, which real life trainers use all the time because of their generally superior strength. In Ash’s world, there are only a handful of each legendary Pokémon, if that. They’re not available for use.\n\nAlso, despite the prevalence of video phones and advanced technology in Ash’s world, there doesn’t seem to be anything equivalent to the internet. If there is, Ash certainly doesn’t use it to bone up on the latest competitive Pokémon trends.\n\nFinally, Pokémon battles work differently in the game than they do in the anime. In the game, battles take place in distinct turns and are determined by defined stats, with each move resulting in roughly the same outcome every time it is used. In the anime, battles happen in real time, and moves can interact with the environment in unique ways that are impossible to replicate in the video game.\n\nAs a result of these differences, it’s best to compare Ash to his peers in the anime rather than judge him by the standards of the competitive scene. But that dodges an interesting question. What if Ash was judged by the standards of competitive trainers? What should he have been doing all these years? Let’s follow our plucky protagonist through the course of the Pokémon anime and critique his performance with a trained eye.\n\nEarly days: Kanto and Johto\n\nAsh’s first tournament run is baffling in many ways, and it establishes many of the problems that haunt him throughout his Pokémon training career.\n\nThe first issue crops up before he ever steps into an arena: his team is painfully unevolved. While Pikachu made a big fuss about never wanting to evolve when Ash earned his third gym badge, his Squirtle and Bulbasaur also remained in their base stages. And while Ash eventually ends up with a Kingler, it starts the Indigo Plateau Conference as a simple Krabby. As a result, his only fully evolved Pokémon going into the league are Charizard, Muk and 30 Tauros, which only has one form.\n\nHis decision to keep some of his Pokémon unevolved may seem admirable to some (mostly himself), but from a competitive standpoint it’s an extremely bad idea. Each evolution boosts a Pokémon’s base stats, which means that unevolved Pokémon are at a significant disadvantage in battle. The game eventually introduced the Eviolite item to somewhat mitigate this problem, but the anime has always steered away from involving held items. As a result, Ash starts his tournament run at a handicap.\n\nThings don’t improve once the battles begin. Ash constantly makes poor choices, only to be bailed out by blind luck or his opponent’s mistakes. His first battle, against Mandi, is a perfect example.\n\nAsh leads with an unevolved Pokémon he has never battled with before: Krabby. He believes it’s smart to pick a water-type since they are battling in a water arena, but his opponent anticipates this by sending out Exeggutor, a grass-type. This immediately puts Krabby at a type disadvantage, but Exeggutor never uses one of its super effective attacks. What’s worse, Mandi never uses Sleep Powder, a status inflicting move that made Exeggutor a top-tier threat in the first generation of competitive battles.\n\nDespite those missteps, Mandi looked like he was going to win. However, after landing a few attacks, Krabby evolves into Kingler mid-battle. This is impossible in a competitive Pokémon battle, but it happens quite often in the anime, whether due to luck or determination. The reason, in this case is luck, but it’s enough for Ash to sweep through Mandi’s entire team without a problem.\n\nSending out a Krabby to a grass fight was far from the only time Ash made a stupid decision during his first attempt at Indigo League. While battling a Cloyster, weak to electric attacks, he doesn’t use his electric-type Pikachu. And while his flying-type Pidgeotto could have soloed his fourth opponent’s entire team of grass- and bug-types, he doesn’t even bring it to the battle. Then there’s Ash’s loss to Richie in the top 16, which happened because his Charizard doesn’t respect him.\n\nAsh’s worst decision in the Indigo League, however, is never using any of his dozens of Tauros, which was one of, if not the, strongest Pokémon in the original trio of games.\n\nAs a normal-type, Tauros has access to STAB Hyper Beam and Body Slam. The former is the strongest attack in the first games, while the latter both hits hard and can inflict paralysis on its target. In addition, Tauros has a handful of useful coverage moves, which made it an even more versatile threat.\n\nFinally, Tauros is also one of the fastest of the original 151 Pokémon. Speed has always been a desirable trait in battles, but the stat was even more important during the first generation because it factored into a Pokémon’s chance to land a critical hit. Tauros landed crits often, and occasionally spread harmful statuses.\n\nBasically, Tauros was everything a trainer could want rolled into a single Pokémon. The fact Ash doesn’t use three different Tauros in every battle, all with a slightly different moveset, is incredibly foolish.\n\nBy the time Ash qualifies for his next tournament, everyone in the anime world has begun demonstrating improvement. Ash still uses plenty of unevolved Pokémon (like Cyndaquil, Totodile, Bayleef and Phanpy), but he makes fewer mistakes when it comes to type advantage.\n\nIn fact, against Macy, he even predicts her attempt to counter-team him. As a fire-type specialist, Macy expected Ash to bring multiple water-types to the battle — which is exactly what he does. To handle those Pokémon, she brings the electric-type, Electabuzz. However, Ash anticipates an electric-type and brings his ground-type Phanpy, which is both immune to electric attacks and can hit fire-types for super effective damage. It’s one of the savviest moves Ash makes in the Silver Conference.\n\nUnfortunately, for every lesson learned, Ash seemingly makes another error. For example, while Ash wisely brought his Phanpy, he squanders it in the same match. As soon as Macy realizes her Electabuzz can’t hit the Phanpy, she switches back to another Pokémon, Quilava. Instead of following suit and switching back to his water-type, he lets his Phanpy faint, forcing the rest of his team to operate at a huge disadvantage.\n\nAn unwillingness to switch out his active Pokémon comes back to bite Ash multiple times throughout this tournament (though it’s possible to forgive him because doing so was against the rules when he was competing in the Indigo League). Even Ash’s peers don’t switch half as often as competitive trainers do. Whether in single battles or VGC, it’s almost always smart to switch out Pokémon when faced with a disadvantageous matchup. This lets the smarter trainer slowly chip away at their opponent and back them into a corner.\n\nDespite his refusal to switch, Ash’s Silver Conference showing was an improvement on his previous result, especially considering his opponents in top 16 and top eight.\n\nFirst, he has to face down his original rival, Gary, who packs a potent, fully-evolved squad. Ash almost throws away the battle in the first half, wasting a Tauros and went down like a chump. Fortunately, Ash uses his Snorlax to even the score. Then, having finally gotten his Charizard under control, Ash endures a bad matchup against a water-type, Blastoise, which he should have lost. However, thanks to the steam created by the collision of fire and water attacks, Ash’s Charizard swoops in with a Seismic Toss to win the battle.\n\nAsh loses his next battle because Harrison brings Pokémon from the third-gen region, Hoenn, making it almost impossible for Ash to prepare a defense ahead of time. The only thing Ash could have done, and something real-life players at Pokémon tournaments do all the time, would have been to scout out his opponent by watching their matches.\n\nInformation is, after all, a huge component of competitive battles. Because there are so many ways to customize a Pokémon, catching opponents off guard is one of the easiest ways to win.\n\nInstead, Ash’s Charizard narrowly loses to Blaziken, and his second tournament ends with a respectable top-eight finish. If only Ash knew that Blaziken was a fighting-type, he might have taught his Charizard literally any flying attack. Fighting is weak to flying, and Charizard has access to STAB flying attacks. If Ash had done what many competitive Pokémon players do and scouted his opponent, he could have changed the outcome completely. \n\nMid-career, mid-tier: Hoenn, Sinnoh and Unova\n\nThe middle of Ash’s Pokémon career is strange. His results show an impressive level of consistent success, but each tournament is such a mixed bag that it doesn’t always feel earned.\n\nHis top-eight finish in Hoenn’s Ever Grande Conference is as fascinating as it is silly. It’s the only time in the anime when trainers participate in double battles, mirroring VGC competitions. But in that setting, Ash plays down to the competition. His friendly rival, Morrison, is a total idiot who, at one point, inadvertently sabotages Ash by convincing him to leave his Pikachu in against a ground-type Dugtrio.\n\nThe double battles we see don’t involve the same well-considered teams found in VGC, but Ash occasionally makes the kind of decisions a real-life trainer might. For instance, he orders both of his Pokémon to attack one of his opponent’s, thus doubling up the damage on a particularly difficult Pokémon. In VGC, this is called double-targeting. He also uses the Icy Wind attack to slow down both of his opponent’s Pokémon, allowing his to attack first. This is just one of many forms of speed control, another essential VGC strategy. After all, knocking a Pokémon out before it can attack denies an opponent the chance to act, which nets a huge advantage.\n\nIf only Ash hadn’t ruined those good decisions by bringing two Pokémon that are weak to fire-types against an opposing Quilava and Charizard, ending his tournament.\n\nOnce Ash goes back to single battles, his decisions degrade further. In his top 32 match against Katie, he lets his Torkoal take a super effective Hydro Pump, and once again tries to Thunderbolt a ground-type with Pikachu. He’s lucky that his grass-type Grovyle is able to avoid ice attacks from Katie’s Walrein and fluke a knockout blow. If Ash hadn’t made such a rookie mistake with Pikachu, the battle would never have been so close.\n\nPerhaps the worst part of Ash’s performance in the Hoenn league is the way he is eliminated by his top-eight opponent, Tyson: with Pikachu losing to a Meowth. This outcome isn’t completely outside the realm of possibility, but from a raw stats perspective, Pikachu has a slight advantage. As a result, it’s disappointing that Ash couldn’t overcome a mediocre opponent when he has defeated much stronger Pokémon time and time again.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Meowth uses both Thunderbolt and Iron Tail, two moves that Pikachu frequently deploys. The difference is that Pikachu, as an electric-type, has both a stronger Thunderbolt and resistance to both attacks. Considering much of the fight involves trading those attacks specifically, Pikachu should have won, and Ash should have advanced.\n\nThe only possible in-world explanation is that Meowth was at a much higher level than Pikachu, but decided not to evolve into a Persian. However, it makes more sense to lay the blame for this match at the feet of the show’s writers. Ash made perfectly fine decisions in this battle, but he lost anyway. Sometimes that happens.\n\nFortunately, Ash’s performance in Lily of the Valley Conference in Sinnoh is every bit as good as his showing t in Hoenn was awful. In Sinnoh, Ash finally embraces the power of evolution and brings a Staraptor, Torterra, Infernape and Gliscor. He does still have an unevolved Buizel and Gible, but at least the latter is that generation’s pseudo-legendary and plenty powerful without evolving.\n\nAsh also realizes there’s no reason to avoid using all the Pokémon at his disposal, and brings back powerful teammates like Heracross, Snorlax and even a newly-evolved Quilava. This gives him more options than ever before, and his battles reflect that. Ash even teaches his Pokémon specific moves to counter opponents, like using Sleep Talk to attack with Heracross even after it is put to sleep by an opposing Crickitune.\n\nSinnoh also features one of the series’ only gimmick teams, something competitive Pokémon players often encounter during practice. The goal of these teams is often to subvert the metagame with unexpected strategies that no one could prepare for without sacrificing their matchups against more common Pokémon.\n\nConway, one of Ash’s opponents, pulls this off with his Power Trick Shuckle, a well known meme strategy for competitive players. The only notable thing about Shuckle as a Pokémon is its grotesquely high defenses and its nonexistent offensive potential. However, using the move Power Trick swaps its stats, allowing it to hit harder than almost any other Pokémon in the franchise. That strategy takes a turn to set up, leaving Shuckle vulnerable before it starts wrecking opponents, but it can do serious damage under the right circumstances.\n\nThe plan works in the anime about as well as it would in real life battle, meaning only briefly. But Conway’s Trick Room Dusknoir is another story. That move reverses the turn order, allowing slow Pokémon to attack before faster ones, and it’s a premiere strategy used throughout VGC battles. Conway uses it to take out two-thirds of Ash’s team, but Ash’s Gible is able to endure enough hits to land a devastating Draco Meteor. Ash does exactly what players normally do when caught by surprise: he stays calm and flexible, and pushes through. The fact Ash prevails against both attempts to out-strategize him is truly impressive.\n\nAsh’s top-eight match against his rival, Paul, is also one of the best in the whole series. The way Paul’s Drapion uses Toxic Spikes to slowly whittle down Ash’s Pokémon creates the same tension that is felt all the time in competitive battles. Not every decision Ash makes is optimal, but they are for the most part solid.\n\nThe tragedy here is that Ash couldn’t use his theoretical best answer to Drapion, an Earthquake from his Gliscor. The powerful ground-type attack would demolish a poison-type, but the anime’s writers have avoided using that attack since Japan’s Chuetsu earthquakes in 2004. Gliscor does manage to eke out a hard-fought knock-out that helps Ash advance to the top four, but having access to Earthquake would have destroyed half of Paul’s team by itself.\n\nThe way that Ash is ultimately knocked out of the tournament is the most understandable of the entire series: his opponent has at least two legendary Pokémon on his team. Tobias is the best example of what it would look like if a competitive singles player found their way into the anime. He’s so strong that he basically solos the whole tournament with his trusty Darkrai. Only Ash manages to knock it out.\n\nThis tracks, since Darkrai was once one of the most broken legendary Pokémon of them all. It could put opponents to sleep with 100 percent accuracy using Dark Void, leech some of their HP away with Bad Dreams and then delete whatever health remained with powerful attacks. Pokémon’s developers have since adjusted Dark Void’s accuracy, making it much less frightening, but that change unfortunately came far too late to help Ash.\n\nAfter Sinnoh, however, Ash regresses at the Vertress Conference in Unova. Not only does he return to his preference for unevolved Pokémon, he switches and calls for dodges far less frequently. This mostly hurts Ash during his top-eight match with Cameron, who only brought five Pokémon when he was allowed six.\n\nDespite having a huge advantage, Ash gives up multiple unnecessary KOs, and essentially loses to two Pokémon: Hydreigon and Lucario. He also gets a taste of his own medicine, as Cameron’s Riolu evolves mid-match and proceeds to blow through half of Ash’s team.\n\nA rising master: Kalos and Alola\n\nAfter taking a significant step back in Unova, Ash finally starts to take competitive battles seriously. For the first time in his career, the only unevolved Pokémon on his team during the Lumiose Conference is Pikachu. Otherwise, it is stacked with powerful choices like Talonflame, Hawlucha, Noivern, Goodra and Greninja.\n\nThe only flaw in Ash’s team is a slight over-indexing on flying-types (three out of six is a lot), but he has certainly made worse mistakes. He more than makes up for this by unlocking a powerful and unique transformation for his Greninja.\n\nBecause Ash advances all the way to the finals, many of the early rounds are shown off screen. The first full battle depicted, against Sawyer in the semifinals, is fairly competitive. Ash losing his fighting-type Hawlucha to a normal-type Slaking is a knock against him, but Sawyer’s strategy, which revolved around taking damage and returning twice as much, was sound.\n\nAsh’s most impressive feat in this match is the way he uses the battle arena. After realizing Sawyer’s Aegislash needs some time to prepare its defenses, Ash orders Pikachu to toss a piece of a chopped up tree at his opponent to disrupt that preparation. The disruption gives Pikachu the opening he needs to land a big Thunderbolt and remove one of Sawyer’s most dangerous threats.\n\nWhile non-anime trainers can’t recreate this strategy, it is similar to how many competitive Pokémon players have dealt with Aegislash. Instead of chucking wood, people use moves like Taunt, which forces a Pokémon to attack instead of defending. Creating distractions is an important weapon in a trainer’s arsenal, and the fact that Ash successfully pulled off the maneuver shows growth.\n\nThe finals match against Alain is a step up from what was already an exciting and competitive semifinal. Aside from mistakenly leaving his Noivern in against a Weavile that can hit it for super effective damage, Ash mostly respects type advantage and avoids being punished for not preserving particular teammates.\n\nBut after all the other Pokémon on both sides have fainted, the match comes down to the trainers’ most powerful teammates: Ash’s Greninja and Alain’s Mega Charizard X. In a competitive battle, Greninja should have the clear advantage, because a Hydro Pump almost always KOs even if Mega Charizard X has full HP.\n\nHowever, because Ash’s Greninja doesn’t know Hydro Pump, the outcome isn’t clear cut. If anything, Mega Charizard X has a slight advantage at the outset because it can take a hit and return enough damage to take down the defensively frail Greninja. Still, thanks to a bit of foresight, Ash puts his Greninja in a seemingly good position to win.\n\nEarlier in the battle, Ash made two good moves that could have tipped the scales between his Greninja and Alain’s Mega Charizard X in his favor. First, Ash’s Pikachu lands a single Thunderbolt on Alain’s Charizard before it mega evolves and loses its weakness to electric attacks. This would neutralize Mega Charizard X’s ability to endure a strong attack and counter for the KO.\n\nSecond, Ash wisely has his Goodra set up a Rain Dance, which weakens fire-type attacks and strengthens water-type attacks. He even timed it well enough that it is still raining when Greninja and Mega Charizard X start fighting. \n\nHowever, Ash stumbles by not using a Water Shuriken to capitalize on that advantage before the rain clouds dissipate. As a result, Ash gives up his advantage and the battle turns into a slugfest, with both Pokémon meeting blow for blow. Then in true Pokémon anime fashion, Greninja and Mega Charizard X each launch one final attack that explodes upon contact in the center of the arena. When the dust clears, Mega Charizard X is still standing, and Ash’s chance to be a league champion slips through his fingers.\n\nRegardless of the result, his signs of drastic improvement in Kalos foreshadows what’s to come in his next tournament, the inaugural Manalo Conference. This tournament features, by far, the savviest decisions by Pokémon trainers ever depicted in the anime. Even Ash’s choice to bring a completely unevolved Rowlett against a fully evolved Decidueye at least follows the rules of type-advantage.\n\nThe only problem with the competitive integrity of this league is its format. The first few battles allow trainers to use just a single Pokémon, the semifinal lets trainers use two and the finals allow three. And despite the glut of strong trainers who Ash faces, the fact that he doesn’t use a full team of six Pokémon in any of his battles takes some of the prestige out of his eventual victory.\n\nYet despite the short battles, Ash overcomes Hao’s evolutionary disadvantage and Guzma’s switch-centric combination of Scissor and Golisopod to return to the finals for the second time in his career. This time he’s facing off against his rival Gladion, who has nothing but tricks up his sleeve.\n\nGladion starts with his Silvally, which can change its type mid-battle. In an attempt to catch Gladion by surprise, Ash uses his newly evolved Melmetal. Unfortunately, this gambit fails because Melmetal is too slow to land an attack. Fortunately Pikachu is able to come in and finish the job, and also fight through the illusion-creating Zoroark. This comes at the cost of Pikachu, however, as both trainers trade powerful Z-moves.\n\nThat brings us back to the big moment: Gladion’s Lycanroc against Ash’s. Ash wins by using Counter in a way that’s not possible to replicate in the game. Normally, Counter only works when a Pokémon has been hit by another attack. Since Pokémon only move once per turn, it shouldn’t be possible for Ash to retaliate off of the first Counter. Doing so would mean one player was attacking twice in one turn. However, because the anime world of Pokémon isn’t bound by the same rules as the game, Ash’s perseverance becomes his crowning moment. For once, he makes few mistakes, and deploys creative strategies no one else could think of to achieve the victory that he, and his fans, had been craving since his journey began.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter examining everything Ash had to go through to win his first championship, I’ve come to the conclusion that determining whether he’s a good Pokémon trainer is probably more nuanced and less exciting than fans would like it to be.\n\nAsh is a good Pokémon trainer, though probably not as good as he should be. Anyone who accuses him of being garbage is probably judging him disproportionately on his atrocious early performances. But after looking at Ash’s entire body of work, and also considering the unique challenges he faces when compared to real-life trainers, it’s safe to say he is fairly talented.\n\nDespite essentially starting from scratch in almost every region he enters, Ash consistently assembles teams that can compete with the best trainers around. He also makes up for occasional lapses in judgement with a fair bit of creativity and determination.\n\nYes, he should probably know by now that his Pikachu can’t Thunderbolt a ground-type. Yes, if he spent some time catching and raising a diverse, fully-evolved team, he’d probably score easy wins.\n\nConsistency is hard to achieve in Pokémon, whether in the anime or competitive tournaments. Only a single player, Ray Rizzo, has won the World Championships more than once, and few champions have even come close to a repeat performance. The sign of a great player is the ability to make the most out of the options at their disposal and navigate an unpredictable field of opponents and obstacles before them. Ash does that in each and every league he participates in, getting better every time. It’s time the Pokémon community recognizes how impressive that is.",

        "authors": "James Dator",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "Wilson definitely had a concussion, and the NFL screwed it up.\n\nBizarre verbiage, a weird situation, and a scary description of symptoms. That’s what we’ve left with in the wake of Zach Wilson’s head injury which occurred on Sunday in the Jets’ loss to the Dolphins.\n\nWilson took a big hit shortly before halftime on Sunday and was slow to get up. He left the field, and it’s here where things got weird. Despite being checked for a concussion, Wilson was reportedly cleared by medical staff — and reports on his status were extremely bizarre.\n\nInitially Wilson was reported to be suffering from “dehydration,” then that diagnosis was changed to an unspecified “head injury.” \n\nThe Jets ruled out Wilson for the remainder of the game, which led to rampant speculation on Twitter as to whether Wilson was faking a head injury to get out of the game. This was fueled by reports earlier in the week which made the quarterback’s status questionable to begin with — so the belief from some was that Wilson was getting hit, and simply wanted out.\n\nThis took a pretty horrific turn on Monday when Lisa Wilson, mother of Zach, posted about the incident on Instagram — and the description, while common, is pretty alarming.\n\n“Zach took some really, really big hits and he fought through it, and really tried to stay out on the field. He didn’t want to go off. He didn’t want to stop playing. So he didn’t really tell the sideline coaches, the trainers how he was really feeling — and he tried to fight through it. [...] After one more blow to the head he really started having problems with blurred vision and his depth perception.”\n\nThis raises all sorts of questions about Wilson’s status in the game, and why his head injury wasn’t caught sooner. The entire purpose of the NFL concussion protocol is to protect players who insist on staying in the game, even when they have suffered a traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe NFL concussion protocol takes decision making out of the hands of the team or player and puts it in the hands of independent doctors. If a player is observed to have suffered any hit to the head, or a hit large enough that could result in concussion they are to be evaluated using:\n\n    Cervical spine exam\n    Evaluation of speech\n    Observation of gait\n    Eye exam\n\nThe purpose of these tests is inherently because a player can’t fake their way through it. So, we’re led to believe that in the hits leading up to the one that took Wilson out of the game no test was administered — then when he finally decided his symptoms were too bad he was tested and PASSED the independent exam.\n\nThis is absolutely unacceptable. The primary issue with concussions isn’t necessarily the hit itself, but subsequent hits after a player has sustained a head injury. By Lisa Wilson’s account her son was already feeling the effects of a head injury before deciding it was too bad to continue. \n\nThere needs to be answers about what happened with Wilson on Sunday. Both as to why he was able to hide his initial injury from doctors, as well as why early reports of the injury indicated that he passed a sideline exam. The team is now referring to the injury as a concussion, but it’s clear that the ball was dropped in a major way on Sunday.\n\nThe future health of the NFL is predicated on taking traumatic brain injuries seriously. Zach Wilson suffered one on Sunday, but it was played off like nothing happened. This warrants further question.",

        "articleBody": "The newly-described species belongs to Ferussina, a small extinct genus of land snails known from the Paleogene period of Europe.\n\nThe genus is currently classified in its own family, Ferussinidae, in the superfamily Cyclophoroidea.\n\nNamed Ferussina petofiana, the new species lived during the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous epoch, some 72 million yeas ago.\n\n“Ferussina was until now recorded only from Paleogene (Middle Eocene to Upper Oligocene and maybe to Upper Miocene) deposits of Western Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, northern Italy),” said Dr. Barna Páll-Gergely from the HUN-REN Centre for Agricultural Research and colleagues.\n\n“The new species is the oldest, as well as the easternmost representative of its genus.”\n\nThe shell of Ferussina petofiana was 10.8 mm in diameter and 4.4 mm in height.\n\n“The shell is depressed with flat base, domed dorsal surface, and rounded or slightly shouldered body whorl,” the paleontologists said.\n\n“Last ca. quarter whorl turns upright, elevating higher than apex.”\n\nThe only specimen of Ferussina petofiana was found in the Densu?-Ciula Formation in Romania.\n\n“Ferussina petofiana was discovered in uppermost Cretaceous deposits cropping out in the neighborhood of Valioara village, in the northwestern corner of Ha?eg Basin, in western Romania,” the researchers said.\n\n“These deposits are primarily known for their fossil vertebrate fauna which includes dwarf dinosaurs first described more than a century ago, although rare invertebrates and plants have also been reported from them.”\n\nThe discovery of Ferussina petofiana represents an important range extension for the genus Ferussina, and adds it to the brief list of European groups that appear to have survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event.\n\n“The occurrence of Ferussina in layers of Maastrichtian age, represents a minimum chronostratigraphic range extension of about 23 million years for this genus,” the authors said.\n\n“Furthermore, its presence in western Romania during the latest Cretaceous also implies an important geographic range extension eastward compared to its Paleogene area of distribution that covers parts of Western Europe.”\n\n“Based on currently available data, it appears that the geographic distribution of the genus shifted westward over time, which is in agreement with the fact that Cyclophoridae are of Asian origin, although such a picture may represent at least in part the result of its somewhat patchy fossil record.”\n\n“The most important implication of the discovery of Ferussina petofiana in the uppermost Cretaceous of Ha?eg Basin is that the resulting extended chronostratigraphic range of the genus (and that of its parent subfamily, Ferussininae) crosses the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary which coincides with one of the most devastating mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic.”\n\nA paper about the discovery was published in the journal Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.",

        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "Giant bacteria are intriguing, underexplored biological enigmas. Many well-studied giants use abundant internal small-molecule stores and/or light to satisfy their oversized energy demands. However, the ways giant heterotrophs (organisms that cannot produce its own food, instead taking nutrition from other sources of organic carbon) fulfill their expanded needs remain elusive. Bacteria of the genus Epulopiscium are intestinal symbionts of tropical marine surgeonfish that are exceptional and unique in the bacterial world. They are the largest known heterotrophic bacteria — a large cigar-shaped individual is a million times the volume of Escherichia coli. To determine how Epulopiscium bacteria fuel their robust metabolism, biologists generated a high-quality draft genome of Epulopiscium viviparus and reconstructed its metabolic potential using a comprehensive approach.\n\n“This incredible giant bacterium is unique and interesting in so many ways: its enormous size, its mode of reproduction, the methods by which it meets its metabolic needs and more,” said Cornell University Professor Esther Angert, senior authors of the study.\n\n“Revealing the genomic potential of this organism just kind of blew our minds.”\n\nFirst discovered in 1985, Epulopiscium bacteria live symbiotically within the intestinal tracts of surgeonfish in the family Acanthuridae in tropical marine coral reef environments, such as the Great Barrier Reef and in the Red Sea.\n\nBecause of its gargantuan size, scientists initially believed it was some distinct type of protozoan.\n\n“Studying these giant bacteria requires capturing the fish in which they live and preserving the cells or extracting DNA and RNA as quickly and carefully as possible,” Professor Angert said.\n\nProfessor Angert and her colleagues were especially interested to learn how Epulopiscium viviparus fuels its extreme metabolic needs.\n\nBacteria that feed off nutrients in their environment, rather than creating their own energy from sunlight, generally fall into two camps: those that have access to oxygen and those that don’t.\n\n“Without oxygen, bacteria often use fermentation to extract energy, and fermenting organisms just don’t get as much bang for the buck from nutrients,” Professor Angert said.\n\nSeeing that Epulopiscium viviparus is indeed a fermenter just made the puzzle larger, as its huge size, extreme reproduction and ability to swim would all require more energy, not less.\n\nThe researchers discovered that Epulopiscium viviparus has modified its metabolism to make the most of its environment, by using a rare method to make energy and to move (the same swimming method is used by the bacteria that cause cholera), and by devoting a huge portion of its genetic code to making enzymes that can harvest the nutrients available in its host’s gut.\n\nAmong the most highly produced enzymes are those used to make ATP, the energy currency of all cells.\n\nA highly folded membrane that runs along the outer edge of Epulopiscium viviparus provides important space for the energy-producing and -transporting proteins, with some surprising similarities to how mitochondria function in the cells of more complex organisms.\n\n“We all know that phrase ‘the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell,’ and amazingly, these membranes in Epulopiscium viviparus have kind of converged on the same model as the mitochondria,” Professor Angert said.\n\n“They have a highly folded membrane that increases surface area where these energy-producing pumps can work, and that increased surface area creates a powerhouse of energy.”\n\n“This basic research has a host of potential future applications, particularly as Epulopiscium viviparus has such effective strategies to make use of the nutrients found in algae.”\n\n“Algae is a growing target for livestock feeds, renewable energy and human nutrition, since its growth doesn’t compete with land-based agriculture.”\n\nThe study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

        "articleBody": "An interdisciplinary team consisting of researchers from the Center for Cognition and Sociality and the Data Science Group within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) revealed a striking similarity between the memory processing of artificial intelligence (AI) models and the hippocampus of the human brain. This new finding provides a novel perspective on memory consolidation, which is a process that transforms short-term memories into long-term ones, in AI systems.\n\nIn the race towards developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with influential entities like OpenAI and Google DeepMind leading the way, understanding and replicating human-like intelligence has become an important research interest. \n\nCentral to these technological advancements is the Transformer model, whose fundamental principles are now being explored in new depth.\n\nThe key to powerful AI systems is grasping how they learn and remember information.\n\nThe team applied principles of human brain learning, specifically concentrating on memory consolidation through the NMDA receptor in the hippocampus, to AI models.\n\nThe NMDA receptor is like a smart door in your brain that facilitates learning and memory formation.\n\nWhen a brain chemical called glutamate is present, the nerve cell undergoes excitation.\n\nOn the other hand, a magnesium ion acts as a small gatekeeper blocking the door.\n\nOnly when this ionic gatekeeper steps aside, substances are allowed to flow into the cell.\n\nThis is the process that allows the brain to create and keep memories, and the gatekeeper's (the magnesium ion) role in the whole process is quite specific.\n\nThe team made a fascinating discovery: the Transformer model seems to use a gatekeeping process similar to the brain's NMDA receptor.\n\nThis revelation led the researchers to investigate if the Transformer's memory consolidation can be controlled by a mechanism similar to the NMDA receptor's gating process.\n\nIn the animal brain, a low magnesium level is known to weaken memory function.\n\nThe researchers found that long-term memory in Transformer can be improved by mimicking the NMDA receptor.\n\nJust like in the brain, where changing magnesium levels affect memory strength, tweaking the Transformer's parameters to reflect the gating action of the NMDA receptor led to enhanced memory in the AI model.\n\nThis breakthrough finding suggests that how AI models learn can be explained with established knowledge in neuroscience.\n\nC. Justin LEE, who is a neuroscientist director at the institute, said, \"This research makes a crucial step in advancing AI and neuroscience. It allows us to delve deeper into the brain's operating principles and develop more advanced AI systems based on these insights.\"\n\nCHA Meeyoung, who is a data scientist in the team and at KAIST, notes, \"The human brain is remarkable in how it operates with minimal energy, unlike the large AI models that need immense resources. Our work opens up new possibilities for low-cost, high-performance AI systems that learn and remember information like humans.\"\n\nWhat sets this study apart is its initiative to incorporate brain-inspired nonlinearity into an AI construct, signifying a significant advancement in simulating human-like memory consolidation. The convergence of human cognitive mechanisms and AI design not only holds promise for creating low-cost, high-performance AI systems but also provides valuable insights into the workings of the brain through AI models.",

        "title": "What happens in the brain while daydreaming?",
        "authors": "Harvard Medical School",
        "date": "2023-12-13",
        "articleBody": "Observations in mice hint at role of daydreams in remodeling the brain\n\nYou are sitting quietly, and suddenly your brain tunes out the world and wanders to something else entirely -- perhaps a recent experience, or an old memory. You just had a daydream.\n\nYet despite the ubiquity of this experience, what is happening in the brain while daydreaming is a question that has largely eluded neuroscientists.\n\nNow, a study in mice, published Dec. 13 in Nature, has brought a team led by researchers at Harvard Medical School one step closer to figuring it out.\n\nThe researchers tracked the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of the brains of mice while the animals remained in a quiet waking state. They found that occasionally these neurons fired in a pattern similar to one that occurred when a mouse looked at an actual image, suggesting that the mouse was thinking -- or daydreaming -- about the image. Moreover, the patterns of activity during a mouse's first few daydreams of the day predicted how the brain's response to the image would change over time.\n\nThe research provides tantalizing, if preliminary, evidence that daydreams can shape the brain's future response to what it sees. This causal relationship needs to be confirmed in further research, the team cautioned, but the results offer an intriguing clue that daydreams during quiet waking may play a role in brain plasticity -- the brain's ability to remodel itself in response to new experiences.\n\n\"We wanted to know how this daydreaming process occurred on a neurobiological level, and whether these moments of quiet reflection could be important for learning and memory,\" said lead author Nghia Nguyen, a PhD student in neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.\n\nAn overlooked brain region\n\nScientists have spent considerable time studying how neurons replay past events to form memories and map the physical environment in the hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped brain region that plays a key role in memory and spatial navigation.\n\nBy contrast, there has been little research on the replay of neurons in other brain regions, including the visual cortex. Such efforts would provide valuable insights about how visual memories are formed.\n\n\"My lab became interested in whether we could record from enough neurons in the visual cortex to understand what exactly the mouse is remembering -- and then connect that information to brain plasticity,\" said senior author Mark Andermann, professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and professor of neurobiology at HMS.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers repeatedly showed mice one of two images, each consisting of a different checkerboard pattern of gray and dappled black and white squares. Between images, the mice spent a minute looking at a gray screen. The team simultaneously recorded activity from around 7,000 neurons in the visual cortex.\n\nThe researchers found that when a mouse looked at an image, the neurons fired in a specific pattern, and the patterns were different enough to discern image one from image two. More important, when a mouse looked at the gray screen between images, the neurons sometimes fired in a similar, but not identical, pattern, as when the mouse looked at the image, a sign that it was daydreaming about the image. These daydreams occurred only when mice were relaxed, characterized by calm behavior and small pupils.\n\nUnsurprisingly, mice daydreamed more about the most recent image -- and they had more daydreams at the beginning of the day than at the end, when they had already seen each image dozens of times.\n\nBut what the researchers found next was completely unexpected.\n\nThroughout the day, and across days, the activity patterns seen when the mice looked at the images changed -- what neuroscientists call \"representational drift.\" Yet this drift wasn't random. Over time, the patterns associated with the images became even more different from each other, until each involved an almost entirely separate set of neurons. Notably, the pattern seen during a mouse's first few daydreams about an image predicted what the pattern would become when the mouse looked at the image later.\n\n\"There's drift in how the brain responds to the same image over time, and these early daydreams can predict where the drift is going,\" Andermann said.\n\nFinally, the researchers found that the visual cortex daydreams occurred at the same time as replay activity occurred in the hippocampus, suggesting that the two brain regions were communicating during these daydreams.\n\nTo sit, perchance to daydream\n\nBased on the results of the study, the researchers suspect that these daydreams may be actively involved in brain plasticity.\n\n\"When you see two different images many times, it becomes important to discriminate between them. Our findings suggest that daydreaming may guide this process by steering the neural patterns associated with the two images away from each other,\" Nguyen said, while noting that this relationship needs to be confirmed.\n\nNguyen added that learning to differentiate between the images should help the mouse respond to each image with more specificity in the future.\n\nThese observations align with a growing body of evidence in rodents and humans that entering a state of quiet wakefulness after an experience can improve learning and memory.\n\nNext, the researchers plan to use their imaging tools to visualize the connections between individual neurons in the visual cortex and to examine how these connections change when the brain \"sees\" an image.\n\n\"We were chasing this 99 percent of unexplored brain activity and discovered that there's so much richness in the visual cortex that nobody knew anything about,\" Andermann said.\n\nWhether daydreams in people involve similar activity patterns in the visual cortex is an open question, and the answer will require additional experiments. However, there is preliminary evidence that an analogous process occurs in humans when they recall visual imagery.\n\nRandy Buckner, the Sosland Family Professor of Psychology and of Neuroscience at Harvard University, has shown that brain activity in the visual cortex increases when people are asked to recall an image in detail. Other studies have recorded flurries of electrical activity in the visual cortex and the hippocampus during such recall.\n\nFor the researchers, the results of their study and others suggest that it may be important to make space for moments of quiet waking that lead to daydreams. For a mouse, this may mean taking a pause from looking at a series of images and, for a human, this could mean taking a break from scrolling on a smartphone.\n\n\"We feel pretty confident that if you never give yourself any awake downtime, you're not going to have as many of these daydream events, which may be important for brain plasticity,\" Andermann said.\n\nAuthorship, funding, disclosures\n\nAdditional authors on the paper include Andrew Lutas, Oren Amsalem, Jesseba Fernando, Andy Young-Eon Ahn, Richard Hakim, Josselyn Vergara, Justin McMahon, Jordane Dimidschstein, and Bernardo Sabatini.\n\nThe research was supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Gilliam Fellowship, the National Institutes of Health (F32 DK112589; DP2 DK105570; DP1 AT010971-02S1; R01 MH12343), a Davis Family Foundation award, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Harvard Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative Faculty Research Award, the Harvard Brain Science Initiative Bipolar Disorder Seed Grant, and by Kent and Liz Dauten.",

        "date": "2023-12-01",
        "articleBody": "A road trip through the communities shouldering the U.S.’s nuclear missile revival\n\nThis article is part of “The New Nuclear Age,” a special report on a $1.5-trillion effort to remake the American nuclear arsenal.\n\nhe point of the thing was to forever change our concept of power. When the U.S. military assembled a team of scientists, led by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, to build a nuclear bomb during World War II with the hope of beating the Nazis to such a terrible creation, many of those involved saw their efforts as a strange kind of civic destiny. The Manhattan Project, wrote Richard Rhodes, Pulitzer-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb, was “compelled from the beginning not by malice or hatred but by hope for a better world.” Oppenheimer himself once said, “The atomic bomb was the turn of the screw. It made the prospect of future war unendurable. It has led us up those last few steps to the mountain pass; and beyond there is a different country.”\n\nWe live in that different country now, one in which it is assumed that the presence of nuclear weapons makes their use impossible. If one nation strikes, the thinking goes, we are all obliterated.\n\nAs recently as 15 years ago, the sentiment of nonproliferation seemed durable. Even American secretaries of state who held office during the cold war were advocating for the final drawdown of atomic weapons. Former president Barack Obama, when he took office in 2009, wanted a world without them and pushed a new treaty with Russia to limit the number of deployed warheads in each country's arsenal. But after decades of efforts to disarm global powers and reduce tensions, the screw is now tightening again. Russia has suspended its participation in the treaty, and it's believed that China is increasing the size of its arsenal.\n\nAnd even while the U.S. was preparing to draw down its total number of nuclear warheads, it sought to replace its existing weapons and modernize its delivery mechanisms. The weapons, which had been designed decades ago, were aging, and their upkeep cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In 2010 Congress authorized an update to the U.S. nuclear triad, the weapons systems deployable by land, sea and air.\n\nNo leg of the triad is as controversial as the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, the arsenal of hundreds of weapons spread across 450 underground silos in Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska. Because the missiles sit in fixed locations—unlike submarines or aircraft—they are seen as potentially vulnerable to attack; because they are considered first-strike weapons, concerns linger that one could be inadvertently launched; because of their geographic sprawl, they have an outsize impact on land use and energy policy. In 2015, two years before General James Mattis was confirmed as U.S. secretary of defense, he suggested to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the military consider removing land-based missiles altogether.\n\nBut around the same time, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center requested the design and construction of a new missile. The contractor Northrop Grumman bid on it and won, and by 2021 Congress had authorized the first investments in an updated nationwide ICBM system, which is now called Sentinel. Like the Minuteman III missiles currently in the ground, the Sentinel missiles will be capable of making a graceful parabolic arc through the heavens to any place on Earth in order to destroy it. The $100 billion that will go to Sentinel represents only the first step of what is anticipated to be a $1.5-trillion investment in the triad, all of which is predicated on ramping up production of new plutonium pits, the deadly metallic hearts of nuclear warheads.",

        "articleBody": "Marine Drive in the Presidio isn’t even a mile along, but as it descends a short hill from Lincoln Boulevard, you’re awarded with one of the most commanding views in San Francisco. Ahead, the Golden Gate Bridge towers above the hulk of Fort Point, while on the right, the constantly churning bay splashes on the rocky shore.\n\nOver the next few weeks, though, that view is going to change. The bridge and fort will still be there, but a large barrier chain that keeps awe-struck drivers from plunging into the icy water is being replaced by a more pedestrian aluminum barrier.\n\nIf you haven’t visited the site, you’d be forgiven for wondering what’s so special about a chain. But THIS chain, dangling between crumbling posts and rusty from years of fog and salty spray, has been featured in countless photos on Instagram and Flickr.\n\nAt least one Instagram user is already mourning the chain’s loss. But a spokesman from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which manages the area, said there’s a good reason for its removal. \n\nThe new two-rail, 3-foot tall barrier will be more tolerant of the harsh marine environment, said spokesperson Julian Espinoza, and its smaller footprint will make the narrow roadway safer for everyone. And while they’ll still be awarded unobstructed views, he acknowledged the pain of photographers the world over.\n\n“While we appreciate that some visitors really like the old design, the new barrier will improve the safety of the pedestrians, cyclists and drivers using Marine Drive and that’s been our priority for this project,” Espinoza said.\n\nThough the chain in its current design almost looked as if it was as old as the Civil War-era fort, Espinoza said it was installed only in the 1990s. Its replacement, on the other hand, will look closer to the barrier that lined Marine Drive during the 1950s (a fact confirmed by watching the relevant scene from 1958’s “Vertigo”). \n\nIf you’re eager to get one last shot, get there fast, as the project is moving ahead quickly. One lane of the roadway will be closed during the construction period (now scheduled to end Jan. 24), but Espinoza said visitors will still have full access to Fort Point during that time.",

        "authors": "Alex Kirshner",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "There’s only one good way for Mike Tomlin to save his job now.\n\nA month ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers were in the midst of one of football’s great stretches of doing more with less. Despite a limited (read: bad) quarterback in Kenny Pickett, a woeful offensive coordinator who had just been fired, and a defense that gave up yards by the bushel, the Steelers entered Week 13 with a 7–4 record. The team had already become the first in league history to sit above .500 through nine or more games despite losing the yardage margin in each of them. That Dec. 3 game against the 2–10 Arizona Cardinals would be at home, as would the following week’s clash with the New England Patriots, who also had all of two wins to their name. Despite Pittsburgh’s flaws, both opponents should have been quite easy pickings for a playoff-bound squad—but instead, the Steelers made more history, by becoming the first team with a winning record to lose consecutive games to teams eight games under .500. Yet another loss followed last Saturday against the Indianapolis Colts, who let the Steelers jump out to a 13–0 lead before scoring 27 in a row. Head coach Mike Tomlin’s team sits 7–7 now, a long shot to make the AFC playoffs.\n\nCan a football team’s decline be foreseeable and shocking at the same time? The Steelers say yes. Nobody who was paying attention thought the Steelers’ formula—get outplayed for most of the game but somehow win anyway—was sustainable. (At least one member of the team said as much with recorders rolling.) But what the Steelers have done in their past three games has been more than a fall back to earth. Instead, it’s been an all-time cratering that does two things: One, it sets a new standard for how many different ways a team can unravel at the same time. And two, it requires a proud franchise that still has as many Super Bowls as anyone else (six) to acknowledge that its longtime formula has failed.\n\nThe Steelers are a case study in collapse. Maybe they’ll learn from it, and maybe they won’t. But the whole world can rubberneck at the mess they’ve created. Because it is astonishing. Naturally, the situation has ignited what used to be a fringe debate over whether the Steelers should part ways with Tomlin, their mostly successful boss of 17 seasons. But to figure out whether the Steelers should take that drastic step, there’s wreckage to sift through.\n\nThe Steelers’ problems on the field are multifaceted and not unique. They have one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL, second-year man Pickett, whom they drafted in the first round out of the neighboring University of Pittsburgh. Pickett has been atrocious, but he’s also spent almost his entire career with an incapable offensive coordinator, Matt Canada. The Steelers fired Canada a week before this losing streak began, but the two assistants who have replaced him by committee have also been bad. (The lone bright spot was that the Steelers gained 400 yards in their first game post-Canada, snapping the NFL’s longest streak by any team, 58 games, of not reaching that threshold.)\n\nIn the loss to Arizona, Pickett got hurt. His backup, former No. 2 overall draft pick Mitchell Trubisky, is also very bad, and he got himself benched at the end of the latest loss, to Indianapolis. 2023 has been a year of competent backup play across the league, with all kinds of journeymen and late-round draft picks emerging to keep their teams in the playoff hunt. Just in the Steelers’ AFC North, the Cleveland Browns have won games with the likes of fifth-round rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Joe Flacco, the former Baltimore Raven who was out of football but is now 2–1 with Cleveland. The Cincinnati Bengals have gotten a 3–1 record out of Jake Browning, who went undrafted in 2019 and had never played an NFL game before.\n\nThe Steelers have gotten nothing of the sort from any of their quarterbacks because the team has an unimaginative offensive scheme and no discernible ability to develop offensive talent. The team has also allocated opportunities poorly. Pittsburgh has two running backs. The good one, Jaylen Warren, signed as an undrafted free agent last year. The bad one, Najee Harris, was a first-round pick in 2021. The Steelers give the ball to Harris a lot because benching him would formalize that drafting him was wasteful. And like any bad team, the Steelers have also had some breaks go against them. Injuries have decimated the middle of their defense, taking out most of their inside linebackers and safeties. Another safety is out for the rest of the year because he got in trouble for making too many illegal hits.\n\nSome teams handle their struggles with class and grow from them. Others help the NFL’s status as an entertainment juggernaut by devolving into soap opera. The Steelers have dutifully done the latter all year. There was the time a star safety and a receiver got into a locker-room shouting match that was dramatic enough to become leaguewide news. There was the time that same receiver, Diontae Johnson, fueled a whole news cycle by elaborately celebrating a meaningless touchdown at the end of a loss, and the time he stood around watching as the opposition recovered a fumble right next to him and ran away with it. (Johnson apologized the following week.)\n\nSomehow, Johnson has not even been the Steelers’ most significant source of wideout drama. That has been George Pickens, the second-year target out of Georgia. Pickens is a talented deep threat, but he’s found himself underutilized for a mixture of reasons—lousy schematics, teams game-planning to stop him, his own failure to get open, and the ineptness of his quarterbacks. It doesn’t help that Pickens responds to his lack of production by visibly sulking every week. During the Indianapolis loss, he declined to block for running back Warren, stepping aside and causing Warren to get tackled just shy of a touchdown. When reporters asked him about it, Pickens said he was trying to avoid an injury and that the criticism was coming from people who don’t play football. Then, Tomlin and a few of his teammates who do play football joined in. “If I was in that position, I would have blocked for him,” Warren said. It’s worth marveling at how exhausted Pickens’ teammates must be to air him out in such public and explicit terms.\n\nTomlin told reporters that Pickens will play on Saturday against the Bengals. That this was ever a question—that it was reasonable to wonder if the Steelers would sit one of their two talented wideouts in a must-win game because he had become such a pain in the ass—was a feat in itself. Meanwhile, the team’s best player, linebacker T.J. Watt, reportedly says that the Steelers have players who don’t practice hard. Whatever Tomlin has done in an effort to reach his players hasn’t worked.\n\nAll of these woes point in one direction: Something about the Steelers is broken at the core. Unacceptable quarterback play? The Steelers have worked around it in the past, even when longtime star QB Ben Roethlisberger was injured. When the Steelers were good, it was expected that whoever stepped in for a game or two would perform passably and keep the train moving. Big personalities causing locker-room disruption? The Steelers have had a bunch of those players over the years. Tomlin displayed Nobel Peace Prize–worthy traits when he coached teams in the late 2010s with the high-maintenance likes of Roethlisberger, receiver Antonio Brown, tailback Le’Veon Bell, and famously prickly offensive coordinator Todd Haley on the same unit. The Steelers kept most of their discord minimal enough that it stayed out of public view, and they had some of the league’s best offenses.\n\nSo what’s different this time? Theories abound as to why the Steelers cannot deboard the Hot Mess Express and play decent football in 2023. Maybe it’s that they no longer have a good quarterback. Maybe it’s that they lack the player leadership they once had. Maybe—and this is the best theory, I think—it’s that the head coach has hired bad assistant coaches and stuck by them out of misguided loyalty.\n\nAt any rate, it all goes back to the boss. Tomlin was involved in drafting Pickett, who shared a practice facility with the Steelers in college. Missing so badly on an evaluation of a player in such close proximity is damning, as is putting him in such difficult positions to succeed. Not firing Canada, the now-exiled offensive coordinator, after last season was outrageous. So was spending a first-round pick on bad running back Harris, and so was letting defensive assistant Brian Flores leave for the Minnesota Vikings after last year. Flores is one of the league’s best schematic innovators, and he’d probably do a better job than Steelers coordinator Teryl Austin, who just happened to be with the organization before Flores made a one-year stopover in 2022. Injuries aren’t in Tomlin’s control, and neither, entirely, is whether a perplexing but talented wide receiver decides to listen to him. But in the areas where Tomlin has traditionally exerted influence effectively, the Steelers have grown stale.\n\nThe irony underpinning these failures is that Tomlin is, by any objective long-term measure, one of the greatest coaches of his time. Everything about his resume that was true a month ago is still true now. That puts the Steelers in an awkward position. They probably will not fire Tomlin, and they probably shouldn’t right now, given the likelihood that whoever replaces him will be much worse. But he’s coming up on seven seasons without a playoff win, the team’s longest drought since the 1980s. His calling-card achievement is a Super Bowl win in 2008, but next is that he’s never had a losing season in 17 tries. That streak might end in two weeks.\n\nEven if the Steelers finish strong, even if they get a fluky playoff spot before a quick elimination, the time has come for some introspection. Tomlin has earned the chance to bounce back from the biggest embarrassment of his tenure, but the Steelers need to find out if he’s interested in doing that. Will he make sweeping changes not just to his staff but to how he hires his staff, so that he finds the best candidates no matter where they are? Will he come forward with a plan to fix the team’s quarterback mess within a year or two? If Tomlin is ready to acknowledge that his approach needs big adjustments, then both parties would benefit from giving the relationship another year. If not, the time will have come when the Steelers and Tomlin should shake hands and move on. Tomlin would have some trade value if everyone decided that a change of scenery made sense. Maybe he’d help Pittsburgh get a quarterback in that way.\n\nThere’s value in never being bad, but only a little bit, because being eternally OK denies any team the chance to draft a savior QB with an early pick. Splitting with Tomlin, then, finally makes a bit of sense. I think the Steelers should try to avoid that, and a better course of action would be for owner Art Rooney III to have a heart-to-heart with his coach and persuade Tomlin to alter his approach. But it’s unclear if Rooney has the chops for that. His lone qualification to own an NFL team is that his grandfather and father did before him. On his own, Rooney has achieved nothing of note, and Tomlin has made the Steelers’ football operation a self-sustaining entity that needs little from the man who inherited the franchise. But at the moment, the Steelers are an unavoidable mess. Their meltdown will soon be complete, and only then will we know what lessons they’ve taken from it.",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "For the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, a corner represented “a symbol of solitude for the imagination”, a place where we can retreat and take refuge from a chaotic world. The colonial street corners chronicled in Robyn Annear’s Corners of Melbourne: The Great Orange-Peel Panic and Other Stories from the Streets, are pretty much the exact opposite. These are places of exposure and effrontery, of noise both visual and auditory, where every lavish claim to fame was as rawly produced as the whole colonial enterprise.\n\nIn appearance at least, Corners of Melbourne is published as a companion to Annear’s brilliant Adrift in Melbourne, in which she took us on a vivid and sardonic tour of some key sites from the early days of the “instant city”. In truth, though, both these books add to Annear’s considerable body of work, where her appetite for humour does nothing to diminish the documentary value.\n\nAnnear is a great harvester of emblematic tales from the historical record, and her curation here of printed material about the street corners of 19th-century Melbourne, largely from newspaper records, emphasises absurdity as an over-riding feature.\n\nBy applying her characteristically vernacular tone to the utter randomness of colonial Melbourne history, Annear presents us with a street-corner population full of preposterous impresarios, riotous quacks and people slipping over all the time on orange peels. That, mixed with the inveterate and tiresome piousness that accompanies all such dubious aggregations of strangers, makes for an inventory of such metropolitan farce that it is a wonder anything good came out of it.\n\nBut a few things did, of course, and one of them was the word “larrikin”. In a fascinating piece of etymological sleuthing, Annear tracks the first coining in print of this now widespread word to a single street corner of the 1870s nicknamed The Granites. This was the corner of Fitzroy and Gertrude streets in Fitzroy, where granite offcuts lying about from a nearby row of terrace houses built by Henry “Money” Miller were repurposed by what we might these days call “street kids”.\n\nAccording to Annear, the gold rush had by the late 1860s produced a “demographic bulge of teens and pre-teens”, some of whom took to converting a slab of Money Miller’s granite into a makeshift stage “to perform songs and routines from popular theatre shows”. A “former Fitzroy boy” writing to The Argus some years later explained how the “first favourite” song on the public stage of The Granites was The Leary Cove, which subsequently became “leary kid” and then “learykin”.\n\nIn February 1870, the term burst into print for the first time as “larrikin”, appearing six times in the first week of February alone. The “Fitzroy boy” was at pains to stress that on Gertrude Street the word “is not, and never was, pronounced ‘larrikin’ but ‘learykin’“.\n\nWhatever the case, finally the town had a word for the “prodigies of cheek and assurance” who not only sang on slabs of cast-off granite but who seemingly terrorised all attempts at colonial comportment, pathetic or otherwise. Annear reports that Melbourne considered itself at that time to be in the grip of a “larrikin plague”.\n\nIn the Carlton Gardens alone, an estimated 25,000 plants were destroyed by larrikins over a seven-year period around the time of The Granites. And that’s before we even get to the more obvious manifestations of larrikinism such as pickpocketing, or emptying the nightpans of local schools whenever it took their fancy.\n\nOne suspects Annear has some sympathy for the learykins, a sympathy that is of course crucial to her storytelling verve. Truth is, she writes with her own brand of “cheek and assurance”, staying well clear of moral outrage to present a decidedly local version of the human comedy. She is also good at defining landforms that frustrate the built environment, such as floods in the Elizabeth Street creek, and city swamps that when levelled with enough landfill could be rebadged as street corners to stage bare-knuckled boxing matches between larrikinesses.\n\nShe also tells us, in a bracing chapter called “Effluent Society”, of the proliferation of leaking noisome cesspits and of urine “literally streaming from the lanes branching off Bourke St East” during theatre intervals.\n\nYes, Melbourne was distinguished among colonial cities for its “lagging sanitation”. And it certainly wasn’t short of action. Nor of advertising either. Billposting abounded in a spruiking free-for-all, and it seems a poignant moment in the unchecked rush of modernity when in 1880 “an advertising station of the handsomest description” was erected opposite the newly built Royal Exhibition Building, in part to hide “the view of objectionable cows”. That wasn’t far from the ol’ Granites corner by the way. Animals, larrikins – what’s the difference?",

        "articleBody": "In the opening scenes of One Life, Nicholas Winton (Anthony Hopkins) is in his eighties, leading a seemingly tranquil life with his wife, Grete (Lena Olin), in suburban Surrey. But the clutter in his study is a revealing reflection of the tumult in his head. His mind is full of ghosts who are reviving memories of the refugees he helped to rescue in Prague during World War II.\n\nThe film’s producers, Iain Canning and his Australian business partner Emile Sherman, first approached Winton 15 years ago to ask if they could put his story on the screen, but they found a modest man uninterested in making himself famous to a new generation. It was only after {his death} they got the go-ahead from his daughter, who had written a book about his war work.\n\nThe film flips back and forth in time, as Winton recalls his first visit to Prague in 1938. The city is already full of refugees on the run from the German takeover of the Sudetenland and the young Winton (Johnny Flynn) – Nicky to his friends – is appalled at the sight of so many children lacking food and shelter in the middle of a European winter. Busy getting the Nazis’ political targets out of the country, his fellow refugee workers, Doreen Warriner (Romola Garai) and Trevor Chadwick (Alex Sharpe), believe it will be too hard to evacuate children as well. But Nicky isn’t listening. His optimism is remarkable, his stubbornness miraculous.\n\nInspired by the Kindertransport initiative already under way in Germany and Austria, he returns to London and calls on his like-minded and equally effective mother, Babi (Helena Bonham Carter), a small bulldozer powered by charm. Together, they recruit volunteers to help raise money, find foster families for the children and canvas support from the British government in simplifying visa rules.\n\nThe Prague sequences are heartbreaking. Garai is especially good as the heroic Doreen, who stays on in the city long after the Nazis’ arrival, but it’s Hopkins who anchors the film’s emotional centre with his slow burn of a performance. He’s always been able to use silence to express all that he’s not saying, and Winton camouflages his passion and his anguish with the matter of factness of someone who is naturally averse to making a fuss.\n\nThere’s something very moving in watching him trying to hold back the tears when he’s finally made aware of the difference he has made to the lives of so many people. Until then, he can do nothing but dwell on the failures – the children he didn’t manage to save. He still has their photos. Their faces gaze at him from the old scrapbook he keeps amid the mess in his study.\nAdvertisement\nLoading\n\nThe film has a rousing finish made all the more potent at a recent Sydney screening where descendants of “Nicky’s children” were on hand to show their appreciation.\n\nOne Life is released on December 26.",

It doesn't matter whether you're a complete beginner or whether you're looking to bag a bargain or even invest some serious cash, you can find a Celestron telescope to cater to your needs. \n\nBeginners are advised to go for a portable easy-to-assemble telescope at an introductory price of less than or around $200 but, there are top beginner options which cost more too. The Celestron AstroMaster LT 70AZ or Celestron PowerSeeker 50AZ are good low-cost, starter models. While the Celestron AstroMaster 114EQ, Celestron StarSense Explorer LT 114AZ or Celestron AstroMaster DX 102AZ will cost a bit more. More serious astronomers should be prepared to make a larger investment. If you’re in the latter position, then we recommend the Celestron NexStar 8SE to add to your arsenal.\n\nWith an increase in budget, comes an improvement in the type of technology that has become prevalent in telescope manufacturing: computerized, or GoTo, mounts. At the touch of a button, these revolutionary instruments are able to slew to your chosen target without needing to use sky maps to find your way around the night sky. The Celestron NexStar 4SE is a great option if you're keen on combining tech with your observing sessions.\n\nIf the telescope isn’t for your use and your kids have been bugging you for one, then the Celestron FirstScope 76 are the perfect choices since they require very little maintenance, are easy to use and are small enough to store in a cupboard. What’s more, their robust build exudes quality for a basic build, offering years of usage and for very little investment — an excellent combination for parents, who suspect that skywatching might be a passing phase.\n\nThe Celestron telescope models we have introduced are perfect for views of the solar system, with notable targets being the craters and seas of the moon and bright sights of Jupiter and Saturn. They will also provide good observations of bright deep-sky objects such as the Orion Nebula in the constellation of Orion (the Hunter) and the stunning Pleiades star cluster in Taurus (the Bull).\n\nThose keen on a substantial step up in quality and closer views of targets will need to consider increasing their budget for a larger objective lens or aperture — that is the \"light-gathering” ability of a telescope. For magnified views of the planets, galaxies and nebulas, the Celestron AstroMaster 114EQ, Celestron StarSense Explorer LT 114AZ and Celestron NexStar 4SE are all worth a look.\n\nBest Celestron binocular deals \n\nCelestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70:\nwas $105.99 now $89.99 Amazon\n\nGet this high-resolution set of Celestron binoculars that will let you look at faint objects like galaxies and nebulas with a 15% discount..

They're also a great option for magnified views of star fields. Save 20%.\n\nNote: Stock is low, so you'll have to act soon to get this deal.\n\nChoosing the right binocular\n\nWhen buying your Celestron binoculars we recommend looking for at least a magnification of 7x or 10x, along with an aperture of at least 42 mm. You should also choose a Porro prism design, while fully multi-coated optics and BaK-4 prisms are a must for crisp and clear observations. Nitrogen-purged designs are a massive plus and keep fogging and condensation at bay during your tours of the universe. \n\nAs your objective lens size increases, so does the weight of your binoculars. Anything larger than 50 mm will require a tripod for stable skywatching. An important skill to master for optimum views of the night sky is learning how to hold your binoculars steady — once you've achieved this, your chosen night-sky targets will truly be sights to behold.\n\nIf portability is your main aim and you're looking to use your binoculars for a combination of travel, skywatching and terrestrial views, we recommend the Celestron Outland X 10x42, which will give you more bang for your buck. The Celestron Outland X 10x50 are also a great option and are comfortable to use for reasonably long periods of time. Observations of nebulas such as the Orion Nebula (Messier 42) and Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) are even better with the larger objectives.\n\nBut, if you're looking for a cost-effective way to gather as much light as possible, the Celestron 20x80 SkyMaster Pro is a top choice. Although we recommend a tripod for a comfortable and effortless viewing experience, it does offer crystal clear observations and eye relief for those who wear spectacles.",

        "articleBody": "'Everyone loves Taters.'\n\nHumanity has demonstrated its full potential, using incredible feats of engineering and orbital dynamics to send a video of a cat named Taters to Earth from deep space.\n\nIt has long been accepted that cat videos represent the peak of human creativity. The Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) experiment conducted by NASA and its Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reinforced that fact on Dec. 11 when it beamed an ultra-high definition streaming video of Taters chasing a laser pointer from 19 million miles (31 million kilometers) away.\n\nThe experiment took place aboard NASA's Psyche spacecraft currently on its way towards 16 Psyche, a curious metal asteroid in the main belt out between Mars and Jupiter, after launching atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Oct. 13.\n\nDespite being an adorable way to demonstrate this groundbreaking technology, NASA leadership says the experiment also lays the groundwork for deep space exploration. \"Increasing our bandwidth is essential to achieving our future exploration and science goals, and we look forward to the continued advancement of this technology and the transformation of how we communicate during future interplanetary missions,\" NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy said in a statement.\n\nThe video of Taters was beamed using a new JPL-developed instrument known as a flight laser transceiver. The instrument beamed the signal in near-infrared laser light to the Hale Telescope at the California Institute of Technology's Palomar Observatory.\n\nIt took 101 seconds for the signal to reach Earth while transmitting at a speed of 267 megabits per second (Mbps). By comparison, Speedtest.net reports that the average broadband speed in the United States is around 219 Mbps, and around 92 Mbps in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Despite transmitting from millions of miles away, it was able to send the video faster than most broadband internet connections,\" Ryan Rogalin, lead scientist for the project's receiver electronics, said in JPL's statement. \"In fact, after receiving the video at Palomar, it was sent to JPL over the internet, and that connection was slower than the signal coming from deep space. JPL's DesignLab did an amazing job helping us showcase this technology — everyone loves Taters.\"\n\nThe flight laser transceiver instrument conducted its initial \"first light\" test in November, sending a signal to Earth from 10 million miles (16 million km) away. Most of the signals it has used in testing so far have been random packets of information, but JPL scientists wanted to inject a bit of fun into this milestone demonstration.\n\n\"One of the goals is to demonstrate the ability to transmit broadband video across millions of miles. Nothing on Psyche generates video data, so we usually send packets of randomly generated test data,\" said Bill Klipstein, DSOC project manager at JPL. \"But to make this significant event more memorable, we decided to work with designers at JPL to create a fun video, which captures the essence of the demo as part of the Psyche mission.\"\n\nPsyche is currently on its way toward a fly by of Mars in 2026, during which time the spacecraft will take a few images of the Red Planet. From there, the probe will make its way toward its main target, 16 Psyche, which it should reach in 2029.",

        "articleBody": "It used to be, back in the good old days, we had those who loved various car colors — red, burgundy, blue, yellow, green, brown, gold and even a few pink car lovers. And, there were also a handful of black, white and gray car lovers as well, but not nearly as many. You get the idea.\n\nFast forward five decades.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, we still see the occasional colorful car (and it’s very refreshing), but not many. The vast majority of cars seen on today’s roads are light gray, medium gray, dark gray, battleship gray (flat and glossy), silver, light black, medium black, real black…well, you see where I’m coming from.\n\nMy family, which consisted of myself and my mother and father, were pretty much green car people. My father Charley was an Oldsmobile new car salesman at McKelvey, McKelvey-Kessler, Yates and lastly Carlson. So, it was no wonder that when my father came across this 1974 Lincoln Continental MKIV sitting in a front lawn somewhere in St. Charles County, he just had to stop and check it out. The result was that the ‘green giant’ ended up in me and my wife’s driveway.\n\nIf you happen to be a green car lover, this car would put a big ol’ smile on your face, as it was just as green on the inside as it was on the outside. That outside color, by the way, was appropriately dubbed Green Diamond Flare by Lincoln marketing. The inside was done up in two shades of metallic green leather and vinyl. The carpet was plush green to match.\n\nThis body style was the middle year of a six-year run for this 1974 model. But, Lincoln tossed the “Mark” name around for several years to include versions of the truly mammoth, full-sized versions dating back into the fifties. However, the Mark IV generation was smack in the middle of the personal luxury vehicle era along with the Oldsmobile Toronado, Buick Riviera, Chrysler 300 and Cordoba. Although the proportions were much like the pony cars, a la Ford Mustang, Chevy Camaro, Plymouth Barracuda, etc., the overall size was huge in comparison!\n\nSome of you may remember seeing my 1960 Cadillac Coupe deVille at local car shows back in the seventies and eighties. That car was three inches shorter than the Mark IV. And at 5,145 lbs. shipping weight, the Lincoln was 440 lbs. heavier than the full-size Cadillac. But as for the price, not even close. The Cadillac had a base price of $5,252 while the Lincoln was nearly double at $10,194. Despite the high price, 57,316 buyers chose the Mark IV.\n\nThe big Lincoln Continental Mark IV was powered by a 460 cubic inch V-8 fed by a four barrel carburetor. Gas mileage? Don’t even ask!\n\nTri-Power Trivia: 1. Green Acres was an American TV sitcom which ran for six seasons from September 1965 to April 1971. Who starred in this popular show?\n\n2. Here’s one for the baseball fans. What is the Green Monster?\n\n3. Fill in the blank. When I was a child, my parents often went to dinner at The Green  restaurant in west St. Louis, Mo.",

        "articleBody": "The Hurricanes signed the nation’s No. 3 recruiting class on Wednesday, according to 247Sports’ composite rankings.\n\nThe list of Miami signees includes five-star prospects like Armondo Blount and Justin Scott, as well as numerous four-star prospects like Joshisa Trader, Zaquan Patterson, Ny Carr and more.\n\nBut the Hurricanes’ class also has 11 three-star prospects who have flown somewhat under the radar.\n\n“There’s at least five All-American selections in our class, five Under Armour All-Americans in our class, nine ESPN 300 players, eight players in the 247 top 247 list,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “But in the words of Jimmy Johnson, I’m more concerned about how they play than how they are ranked.”\n\nHere are five players in the class who may prove to be hidden gems when their college careers are over:\n\nJudd Anderson\n\nAnderson, a quarterback, was the first skill position player to join the Hurricanes’ 2024 class, committing on April 7. He never wavered from that commitment. Anderson completed 74 percent of his passes for 30 touchdowns and seven interceptions with 2,917 yards in 13 games for Warner Robins (Georgia) High. He is listed as the No. 58 quarterback and No. 920 player in the class.\n\n“Judd Anderson impressed us from Day 1 with a couple different things,” Cristobal said. “No. 1, his leadership skills. We saw him play basketball, as well. His ability to move, make people miss, balance, body control, to be able to twist, bend, get out of really difficult body positions was just really impressive.\n\n“And then he was relatively new at quarterback at a particular high school before he moved to another one, and before long, you saw, statistically, what he did. It’s hard to do that.”\n\nDylan Day\n\nDay was a standout at Southern Lab (La.) High who made highlight-reel plays as a senior defensive back. He is listed as the No. 76 safety and No. 695 player in the class.\n\nCristobal touted Day as a versatile defensive back who can play all over the secondary.\n\n“What a year he’s had,” Cristobal said. “He played it all. He plays the middle of the field. He plays down in the box. He plays out as a nickel, the field corner, the boundary corner, does it all. He’s like a rolling 10.7 100-meter guy. He can fly. He’s got a ton of flexibility.”\n\nCole McConathy II\n\nMiami flipped McConathy from Louisville in November, and the edge rusher from Spanish Fort (Alabama) has some of the best high school stats in the Hurricanes’ class.\n\nMcConathy led the state with 24.5 sacks, according to MaxPreps. He also had 111 tackles, 36.5 tackles for loss, four forced fumbles and three blocked field goals. McConathy is rated the No. 49 edge rusher and No. 723 player in the class.\n\n“Another guy that we identified on film as a guy that really fits our DNA, really fits what we do defensively in that edge position,” Cristobal said. “Our edges come in the form of defensive ends and Jack linebackers. They’re interchangeable, depending on what the offense is showing us.\n\n“Explosive, tough, physical, tremendous growth potential.”\n\nDeryc Plazz\n\nPlazz, a 6-foot-5, 290-pound lineman from Jacksonville Mandarin High, is listed as the No. 52 interior lineman in the class, though he can also play tackle. He is the No. 715 player in the class.\n\nPlazz helped Mandarin reach a state title game, and Cristobal cited the lineman’s room for growth as a reason for optimism for Plazz’s development.\n\n“Super athletic, long, lean guy, 285-290 pounds with growth potential. He’ll be 320-plus,” Cristobal said. “Smart, tough, just top to bottom exactly what you want.”\n\nDaylen Russell\n\nRussell, a South Florida star from Miami Columbus, racked up stats on the Explorers’ defensive line, beating Plazz’s Mandarin team for a state championship. He had at least 49 tackles, 12 tackles for loss and six sacks this season. Russell is rated the No. 129 defensive lineman and No. 1,228 player in the class.\n\n“One of the best players in Dade County, one of the best defensive players in the state of Florida, for that matter, that led that team to a state title,” Cristobal said. “Mother is a University of Miami alum. Awesome people, awesome family.”",

        "title": "Let kids be kids and leave child labor laws alone",
        "authors": "Sun Sentinel Editorial Board",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Is a 16-year-old a child or an adult?\n\nThat’s a debatable question only in the Florida Legislature, where the bottom-line demands of business interests are more important than the health and well-being of our kids. The people who write our state laws claim they are pro-family — until it collides with profit and greed. That’s the bottom line.\n\nTheir answer to the question is that a 16-year-old is an adult, period.\n\nThat is the tortured pretext for loosening Florida child labor laws so that 16-year-olds can legally work all-night shifts, without breaks, even on school nights. Under current law, 16- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from working after 11 p.m. or before 6:30 a.m., or more than eight hours on school nights, or more than 30 hours a week, and they must have a break of 30 minutes every four hours.\n\nAll those limits would disappear under a bill awaiting action in Tallahassee.\n\n“Sixteen and 17-year-olds are not children. They are driving,” asserted state Rep. Linda Chaney, R-St. Pete Beach, who’s sponsoring the child labor bill (HB 49) in the Florida House.\n\nWho’s behind this?\n\nChaney is pushing the agenda of Florida’s influential hotel and restaurant industry, whose statewide trade group, the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association (FRLA), is a driving force behind this bad idea. Testifying before a House subcommittee, a lobbyist for FRLA called the new law “desperately needed.”\n\nHotels and restaurants can’t keep enough employees to adequately staff their operations, a situation made worse by the acute shortage of affordable housing.\n\nThose businesses will not admit that they refuse to pay their workers a living wage, so their solution is to expand the work force by exploiting teenagers instead. Wages in the hospitality industry have risen, but the industry strongly opposed the 2020 ballot initiative that will increase Florida’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.\n\nSupporters of changing the law argue that Florida’s child labor laws are too restrictive and that the change aligns with both federal law and laws in 24 other states.\n\nSo, all of a sudden, Florida wants to emulate the federal government. That argument would hold more weight if Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allies in the Legislature weren’t undermining the feds at every turn — and even refusing to accept hundreds of millions of dollars in federal money, most recently to make homes more energy efficient.\n\nEleven to 7 at 7-Eleven\n\nHaving a strong work ethic builds self-esteem. It is very important that young people learn the value of work and the virtues of showing up on time, following orders and accepting responsibility. But that should not include forcing 16-year-olds to work all-night shifts at gas stations or convenience stores in dangerous neighborhoods.\n\nWeakening child labor protections state by state is part of a national movement, The Washington Post has reported. It is partly funded by ultra-right billionaire Dick Uihlein, whose think tank, the Foundation for Government Accountability, based in Naples, wrote the first draft of Chaney’s bill, according to the investigative news site Seeking Rents. FGA is also a fierce opponent of the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nUihlein, an election denier and major DeSantis campaign contributor, founded the shipping supply giant Uline.\n\nThe weakening of Florida child labor laws cleared a House subcommittee easily on Dec. 19 as all 10 Republicans present voted yes and all five Democrats voted no. The Democrats were Reps. Joe Casello, D-Boynton Beach; Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando; Ashley Gantt, D-Miami; Susan Valdes, D-Tampa; and Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville.\n\nDemocrats did the next best thing. They offered a variety of amendments to make it more consumer-friendly, but Republicans voted them down on party lines.\n\nThe GOP majority even refused to consider an amendment that would require businesses that employ minors to keep records of sexual harassment incidents and to let parents see them.\n\nEskamani tried a different kind of logic. If 16- and 17-year-olds are considered adults in the workplace, she said, then they should not require parental consent to have an abortion.\n\n“They’re mature enough to work overtime at a 7-Eleven past midnight on a school night, but they’re not mature enough to decide whether or not to parent,” Eskamani argued.\n\nRepublicans quickly rejected that amendment, too. The sponsor, Chaney, promotes her bill as “youth worker freedom.” That’s just more political spin in Tallahassee. It’s the Cheap Labor Act of 2024, and it will exploit our kids.",

        "articleBody": "Fantasia Barrino, Danielle Brooks lead the impressive ensemble playing resilient women who persevere in an unforgiving world.\n\nHollywood and Broadway have a penchant for rebooting, revisiting, recycling and/or reimagining the same material through the decades in way that often feels like as much a money grab as a fresh approach to older material — but the fourth adaptation of “The Color Purple” proves the exception.\n\nIt’s a blazingly vibrant, emotionally resonant and exhilarating movie musical that does justice to Alice Walker’s iconic 1982 novel and the subsequent stage and movie versions while forging new creative paths and standing on its own as a bold and original work. What a powerful, gripping, heartbreaking, moving and ultimately uplifting tour de force by director Blitz Bazawule and one of the most impressive ensembles in any movie this year, led by nomination-worthy work from Fantasia Barrino, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo and Taraji P. Henson and extending all the way to the smallest of roles.\n\nSteven Spielberg was of course the first to adapt Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning and generationally great novel with a 1985 prestige-piece blockbuster that garnered 11 Academy Award nominations but was criticized by some for reinforcing stereotypes and softening some of the harder edges of the source material. Next came the acclaimed 2005 original Broadway musical, followed by the leaner and equally well-received revival in 2015. \n\nEight years later, Bazawule (a multitalented artist perhaps best known for directing Beyoncé’s “Black Is King”) and screenwriter Marcus Gardley (“The Chi”) have delivered knockout work in a movie musical based on a musical that was based on a movie that was based on a book. It’s a long and winding road, as is the decades-spanning plot telling the story of a number of resilient women who survive, persevere and even thrive despite the unspeakable cruelty of men and the unforgiving world to which they’ve been born — a world that tells them from the outset they have little worth, a verdict they refuse to accept.\n\nOver the span of a well-earned 141-minute running time, the filmmakers balance the grounded and often horrific sequences of drama with a bevy of musical numbers that will take you straight to church and have your feet bouncing in the aisles. It’s glorious.\n\nWith cinematographer Dan Laustsen making particularly good use of the Southern outdoor locales and the production design team creating authentic period sets for the grounded scenes, and exquisitely designed sets for the Broadway-style musical numbers that often delve into pure magical fantasy, “The Color Purple” opens on coastal Georgia in 1909. Young sisters Celie (Phylicia Pearl Mpasi) and Nettie (Halle Bailey from “The Little Mermaid”) are best friends who find fleeting moments of happiness together when they’re away from their monstrous father Alfonso (Deon Cole), who has been raping Celie for years, resulting in two babies that are taken away and sold off almost immediately after being born. (The girls’ deceased mother is played by Aunjanue Ellis in flashbacks.)\n\nWhen Celie is married off to the cruel and abusive Mister (Colman Domingo), she finds herself trapped in another kind of hell and she feels alone in the world after Nettie fends off Mister’s attempt to assault her and runs off, not to be heard from in many years.\n\nWhen we flash forward to 1917, Fantasia Barrino (reprising her role from the mid-2000s Broadway production and national tour) has taken on the role of Celie, who is still living under the harsh and brutal hand of Mister but finds solace in her imagination and when she’s in the presence of two strong and independent women: Taraji P. Henson’s Shug Avery, a free-spirited jazz singer who is Mister’s occasional mistress but becomes Celie’s protector and, briefly, her lover, and Danielle Brooks’ Sofia, who is married to Mister’s son Harpo (Corey Hawkins) and is a room-dominating life force who takes s--- from no one and nobody, no way. Brooks’ brilliant and badass “Hell No” number might just be the scene that wins her best supporting actress, while Henson’s “Push the Buttons” is dripping with Southern sex and seduction.\n\n This is at heart a true musical, and the vocal performances and the choreography dazzle throughout. Director Bazawule engages in some terrific flourishes of style and imagination, as when Shug takes Celie to the movies and the screen dissolves into a stunningly beautiful black-and-white set where they duet on “What About Love?”\n\nAt times the film seems almost overloaded with storylines, though each subplot features electric performances, whether it’s Shug attempting to reconcile with her estranged father, the Rev. Samuel Avery (David Alan Grier), or when the legendary Louis Gossett Jr. turns up as Ol’ Mister, who’s as much of a miserable cuss as his son and is appalled when Celie finally speaks her mind at the dinner table in a scene that ends with an applause-inducing moment. For all its depictions of misogyny, abuse, heartache and miscarriages of justice, “The Color Purple” is also filled with transcendent scenes of hope and dreams, and it brings the curtain down with a soaring note of enduring",

        "authors": "Chip Mitchell",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "The officers worked with ex-Sgt. Ronald Watts, who is tied to at least 230 exonerations.\n\nOver the objections of a former Chicago top cop, the city’s police board could decide on a long-hidden recommendation to fire four veteran officers accused of misconduct more than 17 years ago in a unit led by corrupt former Sgt. Ronald Watts.\n\nA decision announced at a police board meeting Thursday night revealed that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability proposed the terminations nearly a year ago after finding that the four cops knowingly went along with several bogus drug arrests in a 2006 “reverse sting.”\n\nBut the city’s interim police superintendent disagreed this past spring, leading to an impasse that had to be resolved by the board.\n\nPaula Wolff, a board member chosen randomly for that task, ruled that the city should move forward with the discipline case.\n\n“A full evidentiary hearing before the police board is necessary to determine whether the four officers violated any of the Chicago Police Department’s rules of conduct and, if so, the appropriate disciplinary action,” Wolff said.\n\nA COPA investigation, according to Wolff’s nine-page decision, found that all four officers failed to flag a batch of allegedly “unjustified” arrests on April 24, 2006, at Ida B. Wells, a former South Side public housing complex where the Watts unit operated.\n\nThe probe also found that two of them made multiple false written reports about heroin sales.\n\nCOPA chief administrator Andrea Kersten recommended the discharges on Dec. 30, 2022. But interim CPD leader Eric Carter, in a March 28 response, said Kersten’s agency had not proven the allegations by a “preponderance of the evidence.”\n\nCarter served as top cop during former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s final two months in office.\n\nWolff’s written decision said the COPA evidence included interviews with seven people present during the incidents and written police reports that had been “pre-typed with identical quotes” later attributed to three of the arrestees.\n\nBut Carter, Wolff wrote, argued that COPA had not “provided ‘conclusive evidence’ that the four officers were physically present in the precise location of the unlawful arrests.”\n\nUntil recently, a decision like Wolff’s would have been the final word on whether the police board holds an evidentiary hearing.\n\nBut an arbitrator’s ruling in October would end the board’s exclusive authority over terminations and long suspensions and allow the union for most cops to contest them in private arbitration. Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration appears headed for a court fight against the union over it.\n\nOfficers retain police powers\n\nWatts led a tactical unit that was under investigation for more than a decade for allegedly taxing drug dealers and framing people at the Wells complex.\n\nAfter hundreds of allegedly false arrests, Watts and Kallatt Mohammed, another member of the unit, were caught stealing what they thought was drug money from an FBI informant. Arrested in 2012, they eventually pleaded guilty and were sent to federal prison. No other member of the unit has faced criminal charges related to work under Watts.\n\nNo others faced serious discipline either until last year, when Sgt. Alvin Jones retired on the day the city released a COPA report that recommended his firing and that sustained allegations he engaged in extortion with the unit.\n\nCPD has not stripped police powers from any of the four officers now facing discipline before the police board, according to a department spokesperson.\n\nBut Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s office, in 2017, added the four and several other former Watts underlings to a list of cops that prosecutors are forbidden to call as witnesses due to questionable credibility.\nProcess takes years\n\nWolff’s report said COPA’s investigation stemmed from the case of Lionel White Sr., arrested by Watts’ unit members at the same Wells building — and on the same day — as the “reverse sting.” White was convicted of a drug felony and sentenced to five years in prison. He served more than two years before his 2008 release on parole.\n\nWhite’s conviction was vacated in 2016. He sued in federal court the next year.\n\n“After he filed the lawsuit against the city and the officers, Lionel sat for an interview with city investigators in November 2018,” said Joel Flaxman, an attorney for White and dozens of other Watts exonerees. “COPA then took four years to complete its report. That is far, far too long.”\n\nCarter’s opposition to the discharge recommendations added nearly another year. Now it’s up to the city’s Law Department to draft charges against the four officers. The Law Department has no deadline, and the COPA report is supposed to remain hidden until the charges are served on the cops. Many serious police discipline cases languish for months at this stage.\n\n“The city hides its findings from both the public and even the very litigants, like Mr. White and his counsel,” said Joshua Tepfer, another attorney for exonerees. “Fighting these officers’ termination continues the longstanding practice of covering up for egregious police misconduct against Chicago citizens of color.”\n\nSince 2016, Cook County judges have vacated at least 230 Watts-tied felony convictions, according to a WBEZ tally based on court records and proceedings. Nearly all of the 187 exonerees in those cases have sued for damages in federal court.\n\nJohnson’s administration is negotiating a possible deal with those exonerees. If recent city settlement patterns hold, the deal could total more than $80 million, a WBEZ analysis this month showed.\n\nBut White will never see what happens with the discipline cases or the lawsuits. He died this past February.",

        "articleBody": "New York City is fixing the relationship between government and technology–and not in the ways you’d expect.\n\nEvery Tuesday, Jessica Ramgoolam heads down to the New Amsterdam branch of the New York City Public Library, sets up a small folding table, and takes a seat with her laptop. She lays out piles of paper flyers, and it’s clear she has information to share, like a fortune teller awaiting a passing seeker. \n\nJust before 11 a.m., when the library opens, people may begin lining up for her assistance. With the aid of her team, she can communicate with people in nearly 20 languages, and her iPhone can help her manage many more.\n\nThough she holds no unique powers of foresight, Ramgoolam represents for many the keys to the future. Sitting behind a bright yellow sign reading “GetCoveredNYC,” she’s there to help people—anyone—enroll in health care. \n\nDetermining what programs you might be eligible for, gathering the bewildering amount of information required for different applications, and navigating the submission process is a headache, even for the most administratively savvy. \n\nThat’s true even though most New Yorkers have already submitted information about their income and employment to the city many times over, and more and more residents get regular updates from and about the city government through websites, phone calls, chatbots, text messages, Twitter, email, Facebook and Instagram, livestreams, TV, and radio—all of which are used to communicate everything from emergency notifications to trash collection schedules. Not to mention the overwhelming volume of information online devoted specifically to the several public health-care plans available. \n\nBut even with those programs and a variety of tax credits, there are still hundreds of thousands of people in the city who do not have health insurance.\n\nIt’s a reality of politics that is often overlooked: once a law is passed, it needs to evolve from an idea into a plan with a budget and a staff, and from there it needs to actually reach the lives of millions of people. Moving from policy to implementation has always been a hard part of governing, but today it’s easy to assume technology can make it easier. \n\nYet even as technology presents unprecedented opportunities to bridge the gap between government programs and the people they serve, it also brings unprecedented challenges. How do we modernize without leaving people behind? How do we increase access without unduly burdening citizens? How do we increase efficiency and make services easier to use while still protecting sensitive data?\n\n\nToday, technology is both an instrument and a medium of government, and in turn, it’s transforming the way citizens and states interact with each other. And it’s essential, even urgent, that governments understand this relationship—and how easily it can be broken, even by the tools meant to bolster it. After all, civic technology has the power to help, but not everything can be technologically simplified. Not everything can be automated. Bureaucrats can make forms all day long, but they are useless if people don’t know how to use them—or if they don’t even have the resources to access them or fill them out. \n\nWhich is why, every week, Ramgoolam supports uninsured New Yorkers as they navigate the ever growing, ever changing, always tangled web of online forms that promise access to affordable care. \n\n“I’ve come across, in my lifetime, so many folks who have had many detrimental issues with the health insurance system,” she told me. “What motivates me is how great it makes me feel to know that I’ve succeeded in helping someone.”\n\nNew York City is something of a test lab for strategies to confront some big problems that plague the modern state. Akin to a country in the budget and bureaucratic complexity of its government, it is, and has been, dealing with the key question of how to make government work for people today. And through its experimentation, it is finding that sometimes the solution to doing big things also involves doing a lot of small things, sometimes with the lowest tech possible: a human sitting behind a table.\n\n“Why can’t we just …?”  \n\nWhen President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his administration was heralded as more technologically savvy than any that had come before. At the dawn of Web 2.0 and with immense faith in the power of technology to do big things, it hired the country’s first chief information officer, started the US Digital Service to modernize the executive branch, and issued a directive to “build a 21st-century digital government.” Technology was envisioned as a key to the administration’s ambitious plan for expanding access to health insurance.\n\nYet when Healthcare.gov launched in 2013, after three years of work and a cost of more than $300 million, the website crashed. Fewer than 10 people were able to enroll on the first day. \n\nIn the years since, the Healthcare.gov fiasco has turned into a sort of parable for those working in policy implementation. The program’s tech-forward approach was meant to make it easier for people to compare the costs of health-care plans and enroll in one, but at least at first, the tech failed in spectacular fashion. \n\nThe crash was indicative of massive challenges that the US still faces when it comes to government use of technology. Jennifer Pahlka was serving as deputy chief technology officer of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy at the time. As she explains in her book Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better, the failed site launch was a reflection of just how big the “glaring gap between policy intentions and actual outcomes” really is.\n\nIn the book, Pahlka—who also founded Code for America, a nonprofit that pairs engineers, designers, and product managers with government agencies to improve public services—lays out the problem. “Whether for good or for ill, the essence of the digital revolution is that it has become easier to implement ideas of all kinds—business, cultural, and social,” she writes. “Inside government, however, the digital revolution has played out very differently. Even as our expectations about the immediacy and accuracy of services have skyrocketed, the implementation of laws has become anything but easier.”\n\nIn several conversations, Pahlka explained to me how well-­intended policies morph between the time they pass a legislature and the time they finally trickle through the bureaucracy and down to the lives of everyday Americans. And today, of course, the way Americans interact with those policies is so often through technology—government websites, data management and record keeping, or benefit enrollment.    \n\n“Ultimately, we tell the American public we’re gonna do this thing,” she told me, “and then the actual outcome that was desired may or may not occur.” The reason, she argued, is that policy implementation has grown so complex—and technology often complicates it even further. What’s more, the American system isn’t designed to empower technology designers in this process. Instead, legislators are making the choices without necessarily understanding what technology would help carry them out most effectively.\n\n“We need to rediscover what democracy offers to us and apply that in the context of building services, making decisions, and doing regulation that works for people in a way that’s less like ‘Everybody throws their stuff in the pot of soup and then that’s what the soup is,’” she told me.\n\nOfficials working on digital transformation and public services in New York, San Francisco, and Boston all told me that there is no silver bullet. Technology can be as much a part of the problem as it is part of the solution. As Cyd Harrell, the chief digital services officer of San Francisco, put it, the story of government technology is a story of the question “Why can’t we just …?” In other words, the contrast between the opportunities technology seems to offer and the challenges it often creates can make modern governing maddening. \n\nEven if the technology is promising, deploying it takes money and talent. There are challenges with procurement and integrating new systems with legacy tech. There are the realities of budgets, bureaucratic red tape,election cycles, and ever-growing legal complexities. And getting the technology itself right is no simple task, especially when citizens are accustomed to easy-to-use interfaces and information management systems from the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nIt’s all these things at once that make the problems with government technology so intractable. But at the same time, it’s never been more critical to improve government effectiveness. \n\n“The stakes matter more at this moment than they ever have,” says Pahlka. “The [Inflation Reduction Act] is trying to save us from a climate collapse, the CHIPS Act is trying to save us from potential national security disasters, the infrastructure [law] is trying to save us from driving over bridges that might fall. \n\n“These are all core issues where I think if the American public doesn’t see government deliver, I think it’s less that they get driven toward one party or another, and more that they get driven away from government altogether.”\n\nIn fact, according to recent survey data, trust in government is near record lows. Research has shown, too, that people who have had an unpleasant experience with government services are less likely to engage in civic activities like voting—and democracy depends on this kind of involvement from the people it serves. \n\nPeople invest trust in their government when it works for them. And right now it isn’t working. \n\nThe disconnect\n\nBridging the gap between policy and implementation is just what Ramgoolam, the health-care specialist in New York, is doing at her table. \n\nShe is a staffer for the Public Engagement Unit of the New York City Mayor’s Office, which was first created by Mayor Bill DeBlasio in 2015 and was specifically designed to boost enrollment in underutilized programs. Before this, New Yorkers who needed help had to call 311 for assistance or physically show up at the offices of the Human Resources Administration.\n\n“Unfortunately,” says Adrienne Lever, the executive director of the Public Engagement Unit, “there are resources that are underused, and that is just a waste. There is a resource, and there is a person in need. We just need to figure out how to make that connection happen.” \n\nLever told me that often those most in need of benefits are the least equipped to navigate a complex process required to access them, and the discrepancy becomes particularly acute when someone is in crisis.\n\n“PEU’s target populations are often lower income. We work with a lot of seniors. Many of them don’t have access to computers, let alone the internet. Some are homebound and don’t have the ability to go out,” Lever explains. “So with those populations in mind, even if the technology is not flawed in and of itself, they may not have the resources or the information to be able to just fill out a simple Google form.”\n\nAnd many applications are much more difficult to navigate than a Google form. Take New York City’s Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) program, which enables people over 62 to have their rent frozen, depending on their income, even if a landlord raises the price. The city then reimburses the landlord through a tax credit. The PEU has reached out to 20,000 New Yorkers so far this year who might be eligible for a rent freeze.\n\nLever told me about one eligible New Yorker, whom she identified only by his first initial. D called the city asking for help renewing his enrollment in the program, but he was missing some required documentation, including a renewed lease. He also had severe cognitive and physical disabilities after suffering a stroke, which made it impossible for him to navigate the rest of the application online, or even with help over the phone.",

        "articleBody": "The tool, called Nightshade, messes up training data in ways that could cause serious damage to image-generating AI models. \n\nA new tool lets artists add invisible changes to the pixels in their art before they upload it online so that if it’s scraped into an AI training set, it can cause the resulting model to break in chaotic and unpredictable ways. \n\nThe tool, called Nightshade, is intended as a way to fight back against AI companies that use artists’ work to train their models without the creator’s permission. Using it to “poison” this training data could damage future iterations of image-generating AI models, such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, by rendering some of their outputs useless—dogs become cats, cars become cows, and so forth. MIT Technology Review got an exclusive preview of the research, which has been submitted for peer review at computer security conference Usenix.   \n\nAI companies such as OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Stability AI are facing a slew of lawsuits from artists who claim that their copyrighted material and personal information was scraped without consent or compensation. Ben Zhao, a professor at the University of Chicago, who led the team that created Nightshade, says the hope is that it will help tip the power balance back from AI companies towards artists, by creating a powerful deterrent against disrespecting artists’ copyright and intellectual property. Meta, Google, Stability AI, and OpenAI did not respond to MIT Technology Review’s request for comment on how they might respond. \n\nZhao’s team also developed Glaze, a tool that allows artists to “mask” their own personal style to prevent it from being scraped by AI companies. It works in a similar way to Nightshade: by changing the pixels of images in subtle ways that are invisible to the human eye but manipulate machine-learning models to interpret the image as something different from what it actually shows. \n\nThe team intends to integrate Nightshade into Glaze, and artists can choose whether they want to use the data-poisoning tool or not. The team is also making Nightshade open source, which would allow others to tinker with it and make their own versions. The more people use it and make their own versions of it, the more powerful the tool becomes, Zhao says. The data sets for large AI models can consist of billions of images, so the more poisoned images can be scraped into the model, the more damage the technique will cause. \n\nA targeted attack\n\nNightshade exploits a security vulnerability in generative AI models, one arising from the fact that they are trained on vast amounts of data—in this case, images that have been hoovered from the internet. Nightshade messes with those images. \n\nArtists who want to upload their work online but don’t want their images to be scraped by AI companies can upload them to Glaze and choose to mask it with an art style different from theirs. They can then also opt to use Nightshade. Once AI developers scrape the internet to get more data to tweak an existing AI model or build a new one, these poisoned samples make their way into the model’s data set and cause it to malfunction. \n\nPoisoned data samples can manipulate models into learning, for example, that images of hats are cakes, and images of handbags are toasters. The poisoned data is very difficult to remove, as it requires tech companies to painstakingly find and delete each corrupted sample. \n\nThe researchers tested the attack on Stable Diffusion’s latest models and on an AI model they trained themselves from scratch. When they fed Stable Diffusion just 50 poisoned images of dogs and then prompted it to create images of dogs itself, the output started looking weird—creatures with too many limbs and cartoonish faces. With 300 poisoned samples, an attacker can manipulate Stable Diffusion to generate images of dogs to look like cats. \n\nGenerative AI models are excellent at making connections between words, which helps the poison spread. Nightshade infects not only the word “dog” but all similar concepts, such as “puppy,” “husky,” and “wolf.” The poison attack also works on tangentially related images. For example, if the model scraped a poisoned image for the prompt “fantasy art,” the prompts “dragon” and “a castle in The Lord of the Rings” would similarly be manipulated into something else. \n\nZhao admits there is a risk that people might abuse the data poisoning technique for malicious uses. However, he says attackers would need thousands of poisoned samples to inflict real damage on larger, more powerful models, as they are trained on billions of data samples. \n\n“We don’t yet know of robust defenses against these attacks. We haven’t yet seen poisoning attacks on modern [machine learning] models in the wild, but it could be just a matter of time,” says Vitaly Shmatikov, a professor at Cornell University who studies AI model security and was not involved in the research. “The time to work on defenses is now,” Shmatikov adds.\n\nGautam Kamath, an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo who researches data privacy and robustness in AI models and wasn’t involved in the study, says the work is “fantastic.” \n\nThe research shows that vulnerabilities “don’t magically go away for these new models, and in fact only become more serious,” Kamath says. “This is especially true as these models become more powerful and people place more trust in them, since the stakes only rise over time.” \n\nA powerful deterrent\n\nJunfeng Yang, a computer science professor at Columbia University, who has studied the security of deep-learning systems and wasn’t involved in the work, says Nightshade could have a big impact if it makes AI companies respect artists’ rights more—for example, by being more willing to pay out royalties.\n\nAI companies that have developed generative text-to-image models, such as Stability AI and OpenAI, have offered to let artists opt out of having their images used to train future versions of the models. But artists say this is not enough. Eva Toorenent, an illustrator and artist who has used Glaze, says opt-out policies require artists to jump through hoops and still leave tech companies with all the power. \n\nToorenent hopes Nightshade will change the status quo. \n\n“It is going to make [AI companies] think twice, because they have the possibility of destroying their entire model by taking our work without our consent,” she says. \n\nAutumn Beverly, another artist, says tools like Nightshade and Glaze have given her the confidence to post her work online again. She previously removed it from the internet after discovering it had been scraped without her consent into the popular LAION image database. \n\n“I’m just really grateful that we have a tool that can help return the power back to the artists for their own work,” she says.",

        "authors": "Lance Ulanoff",
        "date": "2023-09-19",
        "articleBody": "A big screen, fantastic cameras, and a winning look and feel \n\nIn virtually every respect, the iPhone 15 Pro Max raises the bar not only for the iPhone family but for smartphones in general. From the new materials to some of the best smartphone cameras we've ever used, Apple's big flagship ticks box after box. It falls marginally short of perfection thanks to a slightly higher price tag than the last model, the lack of true fast charging, and Apple's frustrating insistence on presenting 5x optical zoom as the apex of smartphone telephoto technology. Still, these end up being minor quibbles that don't detract meaningfully from what is a broadly exceptional iPhone experience.\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max\n\nLeave it to Apple to make titanium sound sexy, while also putting me in mind of my somewhat aging joints. \n\nI know, Apple enthusiastically told us how the iPhone 15 Pro Max (and Pro) uses the same titanium as was used by NASA on the Mars rover. I buy that, and it sounds impressive; but when I think of titanium, I usually think of hip or knee replacements. The low-corrosion, lightweight, and high-strength material is favored by surgeons for those properties, and it's for those same reasons that it makes perfect sense as the new frame material for the iPhone.\n\nPatients sporting new titanium knees and hips will likely never get to touch the metal, but if you buy an iPhone 15 Pro Max or – as I did – test it, you'll find that it's smooth yet solid, with a brushed surface that feels cool but not cold. Holding the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max is a distinctly different experience compared to handling the iPhone 14 Pro Max; it's lighter, and the titanium feels a little warmer than the polished steel of its predecessor.\n\nIt's not just the titanium, though; Apple has made a small yet subtle change to the frame, removing just enough metal to add contoured edges all around. It's one of the smallest yet most impactful changes I've seen a smartphone manufacturer make to a design, and it truly changes how the phone feels in the hand.\n\nStaying with the frame, Apple's retirement of the silence / ring button is one of the most welcome and useful changes. It takes a dull, one-trick-pony analog feature and transforms it into a sleek, customizable button that can be almost anything you want it to be.\n\nThe biggest change for some iPhone fans, though, will be the introduction of the USB-C port in place of Lightning. I know there's a fair amount of frustration over the change (all those now-useless cords in your home, office, and car) but it doesn't change the operation of the phone, and at least Apple supplies you with a woven USB-C-to-USB-C cable. I will miss the old port, but believe we'll all soon forget it.\n\nNaturally, if those external changes were the only differences between this phone and its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro Max might be a disappointment. However, this is a significantly more powerful phone than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, with Apple's all-new A17 Pro silicon that, for the first time ever, brings console-quality gaming to the iPhone line. Granted, console games like Resident Evil: Village were not designed for a 6.7-inch display, even Apple's high-definition Super Retina XDR OLED panel, although at least that display now benefits from the smallest iPhone bezels I've seen.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max's triple-camera array looks unchanged from the iPhone 14 Pro Max's, but looks can be deceiving – there are upgrades both inside and out that help to deliver one of the best photography experiences you'll find on any phone.\n\nWhile Apple appears to have used the same 48MP primary camera sensor as in last year's Pro Max, it's basically rebuilt its image processing pipeline.\n\nThere's a new 24MP default image size that cannily combines 12MP of pixel-binned image data with full-sensor 48MP information for images that are, in almost all instances, true-to-life (Apple may be over-blueing the sky a little).\n\nThe new setup is more versatile too. I never had to decide if I wanted to shoot portrait mode now or later – in most instances, if the iPhone 15 Pro Max could read depth information, it stored all the detail I'd need to change a photo to portrait mode and choose the focus subject post-shoot.\n\nIf you were hoping for 10x optical zoom on an iPhone, though, the iPhone 15 Pro Max will disappoint you (though not as much as the 3x optical iPhone 15 Pro). I was frustrated when Apple announced that it had only raised the maximum optical zoom on its largest smartphone to 5x; after all, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has an excellent 10x optical zoom, plus the wild, AI-assisted 100x Space Zoom (which may add too much 'artificial' information for my taste, but it's an option if you need it).  Apple does do a remarkably good job of competing with just half that zoom range, largely because the image quality at that extended focal length is simply excellent, rivaling and sometimes beating Samsung's best camera.\n\nThe combination of its new 3nm chipset, a display that can stop down to a power-sipping 1Hz, and smart power management may account for excellent full-day-plus battery life; though your experience will depend on how you use the iPhone.\n\nIn short (this is my two-minute review, after all), this is my favorite iPhone ever. I usually don't like Apple's largest iPhone, but the iPhone 15 Pro Max is lighter (and a tiny bit smaller) than the iPhone 14 Pro Max which – along with the new contoured edges – makes it feel comfortable in my hand. Add to all that excellent photography, fast performance, and seemingly unlimited potential and you've got a lock for a place at or near the top of our best phone list.\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Specs\n\nDimensions:\t159.9mm x 76.7mm x 8.25mm\nWeight:\t221g\nDisplay:\t6.7-inch OLED\nResolution:\t2796 x 1290 pixels\nRefresh rate:\tAdaptive 1-120Hz\nChipset:\tApple A17 Pro\nStorage:\t256GB, 512GB, 1TB\nRear Cameras:\t48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP telephoto w/ 5x optical zoom\nFront Camera:\t12MP\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Price and availability\n\n    Starts at $1,199 / £1,199 / AU$2,199\n    You now pay more for Apple's best iPhone\n    There's more starting storage (and memory)\n\nApple unveiled the iPhone 15 Pro Max alongside the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro at its 'Wonderlust' event on September 12. Since then I've been putting all the new handsets through their paces, so when you're done here be sure to check out my iPhone 15 review, iPhone 15 Plus review, and iPhone 15 Pro review.  \n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 / £1,199 / AU$2,199 , which is a price hike over its predecessor – the iPhone 14 Pro Max – but you do get twice the storage in the base model: 256GB. This also puts the iPhone 15 Pro Max in line with the starting price of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra (both now start at 256GB). \n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max became available to buy in-store and online on September 22, and if you're interesting in picking one up, head over to our iPhone 15 Pro Max deals page for a roundup of all the best offers available now.\n\nIt's not entirely accurate to say Apple raised the price of the iPhone 15 Pro Max (from the iPhone 14 Pro Max base price) because what it actually did was remove a tier and settle on the 256GB storage and $1,119 as the new base model. This makes the iPhone 15 Pro Max a little less affordable (no less so than the similarly configured Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) but, as I see it, 256GB should really be the base storage on all smartphones nowadays, especially as we continue to shoot higher resolution photos and videos (and manage our lives on them).\n\nIf storage is your jam, you can pack the iPhone 15 Pro Max (or iPhone 15 Pro) with up to 1TB of storage and pay $1,599 / £1,599 / AU$2,899 for the privilege. What you won't get for that price, though, is more memory. While the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra raises the RAM level to 12GB – starting with its 512GB model, the iPhone 15 Pro Max seemingly sticks with 8GB through all tiers.\n\nThere's no getting around that this is Apple's most expensive iPhone, but at least there are numerous payment options, including those from Apple which can start as low as $33 a month in the US. As for whether or not the iPhone 15 Pro Max is worth the money, its design, build, quality, and exceptional capabilities convince me it is. Even at this price, I suspect it will be Apple's best-seller.\n Value score: 4.5 / 5\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Design\n\n    Titanium!\n    Contoured edges make it a pleasure to hold\n    It's lighter and slightly smaller\n    Exquisite build\n\nIn case you haven't heard, Apple's 2023 Pro-level iPhone has traded in its shiny stainless steel frame for a brushed titanium one. It's tough (though not necessarily harder than steel), corrosion-resistant, and – perhaps most importantly for your hands, pockets, and bags – a lighter material.\n\nApple made a handful of other changes that give the phone a new look and feel beyond changing up the outer metalwork, however. First are the new contoured edges. It's true that this iPhone can, at a glance, look almost exactly the same as the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but close inspection reveals rounding along the sides that give the phone a softer look and make it – especially at this size – much more comfortable to hold. Additionally, the Super Retina XDR display looks larger (and the Dynamic Island looks smaller), thanks to a noticeably thinner bezel.\n\nThe phone feels different because the dimensions and weight are different. Where the iPhone 14 Pro Max was 77.6 x 160.7 x 7.85mm, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 76.7 x 159.9 x 8.25mm. That means it's just a hair smaller than the last model, a fact I confirmed when I tried slipping the iPhone 15 Pro Max into an iPhone 14 Pro Max leather case (Apple is no longer selling leather accessories) and it was loose inside it. It is worth noting that the new phone is almost a millimeter thicker than the last model.\n\nHowever, thanks to the titanium body and new recycled aluminum frame, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 19 grams lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro Max (221g vs. 240g). That's a noticeable difference.\n\nAnother major design change is actually a functional one: the new USB-C port. It's a little bit larger than the departed Lighting port but will – if you have the right cable – bring some 10Gbps high-speed data transfer capabilities (the cable Apple ships with the iPhone is not a high-speed one).\n\nThe body is covered on the front and back with what Apple calls \"tough glass-based materials\", and on the front is also their Ceramic Shield, designed to protect the glass from damage. I'm not in the business of dropping my phones, so I could not tell you much about the strength of these glass materials. I did, though subject the phone to a dunk in a water fountain. The IP68-rated phone handled it just fine. That was just for a moment, but the phone is rated to handle swimming in up to six feet of fresh water for 30 minutes. If you dunk your phone, just remember that you can't plug it into a charger again until it's completely dry.\n\nApple didn't mess with the power/sleep/Siri button or the pair of volume buttons but right above that is Apple's other big design/functionality change: the new Action button, which is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nThis tiny little button replaces the long-surviving silence/ring switch (still available on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus). Instead of a single-function switch, the Action button is programmable via one of Apple's most high-designed utility interfaces ever.\n\nThe Action button defaults to ring/silence control but instead of a switch, it takes a press to check the status of your phone (ring or silent) and a long press to change it. Many people may leave well enough alone here, but then they'd be missing out on all the hidden utility. Action button can enable a preferred Focus Mode (with detailed controls inside the Action button settings page), turn the flashlight on and off, launch voice memos, turn your phone into a digital magnifying glass, run your favorite Shortcut, offer instant access to accessibility features, launch the camera, or even turn off all Action button features (a waste, really). If you miss the ring/silent control you can still find it under the updated Control Center too.\n\nAfter trying out the Action button in default mode, I quickly switched it to control the camera. From there, I could use a long-press to instantly open the camera and then use a quick press to take a picture.\n\nThe only downside to this new button is that if you are in the habit of taking a lot of screenshots by simultaneously pressing the power and volume up buttons, you may accidentally press the new Action button instead because, well, it's now the top button on the left side of the phone. I expect this to become an iPhone 15 Pro Max meme (\"When you press Action instead of Volume Up\").\n\nIn total, I think the iPhone 15 Pro Max design retains what was good about the last model while making ergonomic and functionality tweaks that move the familiar into the future, with a lighter chassis, smoother lines, a bigger screen, and more functional buttons and ports.\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Sustainability\n\nOver the years, Apple has been rethinking its packaging and, increasingly its products, with an eye toward sustainability. I can still remember when Apple started using biodegradable packaging on its EarPods. The corn-based material would dissolve in water. Now, Apple's efforts extend to its Apple Watch Series 9 (Apple claims the product is now carbon neutral) and iPhones.\n\nThis iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 100% recycled aluminum interior and uses recycled cobalt in its battery. Beyond the phone, Apple is whittling away at its carbon footprint by using more earth-friendly materials. In past years, I would usually get leather cases to protect my iPhone test unit but leather is not exactly carbon-friendly. This year, Apple is using a new material, FineWoven, on cases and MagSafe Apple Wallets.\n\nThose cases, by the way, still feel luxurious. My wife thought they were faux suede, but I pointed out the ultra-fine weave.\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Display\n\n    6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED\n    Surrounded by ultra-thin bezels\n    Unchanged resolution. Still supports ProMotion adaptive refresh rate\n    Always-on display\n\nIf you liked the 6.7-inch display on the iPhone 14 Pro Max, you'll probably like the iPhone 15 Pro Max's screen just that little bit more.\n\nApple shaved millimeters off the black bezel surrounding the Super Retina XDR OLED screen to make it seem larger (this also makes the Dynamic Island look smaller). Between that and the newly-curved edges, it really looks as if the screen extends all the way to the outer edge of the phone.\n\nTo be clear, the screen is slightly larger but the resolution, 2796 x 1290 and 460ppi is unchanged from the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Essentially, this iPhone is just giving those pixels a little more breathing room.\n\nIt remains a beautiful and bright screen, with a maximum brightness of 2000 nits, which means I had no trouble using it outdoors in bright sunlight. Its wide color gamut means visuals are rich and the 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio endows it with support for the inkiest of blacks. Looking at everything from photos to games, apps, websites, and videos on this display is a pleasure.\n\nProMotion support means the iPhone 15 Pro Max is as adept at handling web page scrolling as it is at videos and gaming. All motion looks smooth. Plus, the phone's ability to stop down to 1Hz means that, when it needs to, it sips power while still providing you information; ideal for always-on functionality.\n\nI put the iPhone 15 Pro Max on a Belkin Boost Charge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless charge stand with MagSafe, which automatically puts the phone in iOS 17's new Standby mode, and then set it up on my nightstand. Overnight, the Always-On display was just bright enough that I could glance at it in the middle of the night and see the time.\n\nThis is still an excellent smartphone display, though I wonder why, now that Samsung's flagship has an integrated pen and supports not only touch but stylus input, Apple can't finally add Apple Pencil support to its biggest and best smartphone. Even so, I understand that not everyone needs or wants pen input and that may be something Apple intuits as well.\n\nBasically, what you have is Apple's top-notch screen technology, slightly embiggened and now supported by some excellent new iOS 17 functionality.\nDisplay score: 4.5 / 5\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Cameras\n\n    Dedicated 5x optical zoom camera\n    New 48MP primary sensor\n    Impressive new portrait photography capabilities\n\nIf you read the iPhone 15 Pro Max's specs, see 48MP, and think little has changed since the iPhone 14 Pro Max, you would be mistaken.\n\nBefore I dig in, take a look at those specs:\n\n    Main: 48MP f/1.78 w/ OIS\n    Ultra-wide: 12MP f/2.2 w/ 120º FoV\n    Telephoto: 12MP, f/2.8 w/ 5x optical zoom & 3D sensor shift OIS\n    Front-facing TrueDepth: 12MP f/1.9\n\nLeaving aside the obviously-different 5x optical zoom camera (even the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't get that new snapper), let's look at the leading 48MP sensor. It's not the same one as was introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro Max (or the new iPhone 15). It's larger and, reportedly a Sony-made IMX903. And Apple is using this sensor in ways it has never done before.\n\nEvery default image I shot with the iPhone 15 Pro Max comes rendered at 24MP resolution. Yes, that's a new resolution for iPhones and Apple manages it by first pixel binning 48 megapixels-worth of data into the best possible 12 megapixel still and then combining that with the full detail of the 48MP sensor. The only downside is that 24MP images will be larger than 12MP stills (by about a megabyte). Apple mitigates the storage cost a bit by automatically storing photos in HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) format. You can also shoot in 48MP RAW format for uncompressed imagery, ready for editing.\n\nThe result is some truly eye-popping images. The colors are brighter and, with the exception of maybe a just too-blue sky (possibly a result of more aggressive use of smart HDR), the most accurate I have ever seen from a smartphone. Even in direct comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the iPhone 15 Pro Max won. The colors in flowers are perfect and the sharpness is startling. My macros are levels above what I gathered with the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. The skin tones are exact. It didn't matter the skin tone, the iPhone 15 Pro Max understood it and reproduced it. I, for instance, look just as pale and freckled as I do in real life. \n\nApple has stuffed this iPhone full of more pro-level photography tools than ever before. In particular, you can now choose physical camera-like digital lenses, from 13mm to 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 48mm, and 120mm for the 5x zoom.  You can see these measurements in the camera app by holding down on one of the main magnification levels. You can also go into settings and set one of the lenses as a default.\n\nFor most consumers, though, this might be more control than they want or need. It might help to understand what millimeters (mm) in lenses actually mean. The mm defines the degree of magnification and field of view. Lower mm means a wider field of view and lower magnification. Obviously, you can ignore this or act like a pro photographer and start switching up digital lenses during a shoot.\n\nApple's decision to use just a 5x optical zoom is a source of frustration but I can't really argue with the result. The lens, which uses an unusual tetraprism (four turns of the light between the lens and the image sensor), captures some lovely images. So while this is a long way from 10x optical zoom, I think Apple fans will still be pleased with this result. You can zoom quite a bit further with digital zoom but these images never hold up upon close examination.\n\nWorking in conjunction with that zoom is the new 3D sensor shift optical image stabilization which does a much better job of keeping shots stable, especially on digitally zoomed videos. I was impressed with the stabilization when I was capturing a video of a robin who was perched up in swaying branches at least five yards away from me.\n\nThe entire iPhone 15 line essentially refines portrait photography. There's still a specific mode, but you no longer need to use it to get the same result. As long as the iPhone 15 Pro Max's cameras can capture depth information, you can turn almost any photo into a portrait shot after the fact, even if it was shot with only the main camera.\n\nYou can tell if the camera is seeing any depth while you shoot because a little \"Portrait f\" will appear in the upper righthand corner. You can tap on it and then select Portrait (On or Off) to see what the photo would look like in portrait mode. it doesn't always work because, if the camera does not 'see', say, a person, or pet or fails to capture any useful depth information, then you can't change a photo to portrait mode; in my experience, most photos were convertible, however. As with traditional Portrait Mode shots, you can set the depth of field but additionally, you can now also tap on different subjects to change the focus point. This works just as advertised and makes you feel like a god of portrait photography.\n\nPortrait photography – including that taken with the front-facing TrueDepth camera – got a huge upgrade with access to Apple's Photonic Engine (I know, Apple, loves it's tech labels) that just makes portrait photography look more authentic and less computational than ever.\n\nApple has made some leaps in low-light and night photography. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's ISPs (image signal processors) collect more light and make better use of it in even the most challenging situations. It's not vastly better than what you get with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, but I think Apple achieves parity.\n\nNight photography is better, too. I noticed less green in the star photography and more stars. The one thing I still can't do as easily as I can with the Galaxy S23 Ultra is take star trail photography (without a third-party app).\n\nThe iPhone remains a great video capture tool, with a wide variety of lens options, Action mode for shooting your child's soccer game without nausea-inducing judder, and Cinematic mode for when you want to shoot auteur-quality video. The last, by the way, works just like portrait mode photography in that you can, while capturing video, shift focus from one subject to another with just a tap (in filmmaking, this is the job of the focus puller). What the iPhone 15 Pro Max can do that you can't with the traditional film is change the focus point of the video after shooting. It's more than a neat trick and could be useful if you happen to forget to focus on the right subject during the initial shoot.\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max: Camera samples\n\nThe phone now maxes out at shooting 4K 60fps ProRes, while I'd say leaving out 8K video shooting capabilities (which some rivals support) could only be a problem if I thought anyone actually had an 8K TV in their home.\n\nEven as Apple dips its toes further into the pro-level smartphone photography waters, its camera app does not yet feel as deep and versatile as Samsung's, which may go a bit too far and accidentally bury some really useful features.\n\nAgain, I think Apple knows its consumers better than most and is being careful about what it presents to iPhone users; not wanting to confuse them while also not holding them back, either. It's a delicate balance. In the end, Apple mostly pulls it off and the real proof is in the fantastic image quality, which should make any smartphone owner envious.\n Camera score: 5 / 5\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Performance\n\n      Hello new A17 Pro\n      8GB of RAM\n      More base storage (for a price)\n\nEver since Apple launched Apple silicon, it's been pushing the boundaries of what's possible, with system-on-chips (SoCs) in laptops, desktops, and mobile that rival and often beat the competition, and sometimes they even take generational leaps.\n\nI think it's fair to call the A17 Pro a leap forward from the A16 Bionic in the iPhone 14 Pro Max (the chip now also powering the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus). As compared to the A16 Bionic, the A17 Pro is built on an even-smaller 3nm process, which should improve efficiency (think battery life), with a CPU that is 10% faster and a six-core GPU that's not only 20% faster but supports on-hardware Ray Tracing.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max Geekbench 6 results support Apple's performance claims. It shows that the A17 Pro is running at a 3.78GHz clockspeed, as compared to 3.46GHz for the A16 Bionic and 3.36GHz for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 inside the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.\n\nNumbers, naturally, only tell part of the performance story. For me, it's what I can do with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. One of the promised experiences is playing console-quality games natively. Not gonna lie, I was skeptical. Console gaming is not mobile gaming and never the twain shall meet – until they do on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\napcom gave me test flight access to the ported version of Resident Evil: Village. It was a large file that I needed to download at home on WiFi. Once it loaded up I immediately saw a problem. The game is designed for consoles and their controllers. Without one, Resident Evil put the controls on-screen – all the buttons you would usually find on a console controller were crowding the 6.7-inch display. I realized I needed a physical controller, so I borrowed one of my son's extra Xbox controllers and connected it to the phone via Bluetooth.\n\nI'm not much of a gamer, but the visuals, especially on the cut scenes, look quite good on the 6.7-inch display. Still, on such a small console gaming screen, losing even a little bit of space to the Dynamic Island is frustrating.\n\nThe graphics never stuttered or tore. I only noticed one spot of pixelation early in the game, where a shadow didn't quite hold together on the snow. This was a repeatable experience which makes me wonder if it's less about the A17 Pro and more about the game port from console to mobile.\n\nThe game was otherwise responsive and the sound was excellent. When I put in my AirPods Pro, I was presented with a really captivating and immersive experience; an experience good enough for me to proclaim that console-quality gaming has finally arrived on the mobile phone.\n\nOutside of gaming, every action on the iPhone 15 Pro Max was as responsive as I expected and wanted it to be. I tried editing multiple 4K 60fps clips in iMovie and found no issues with it or the output. The speed of the latter was no faster on the A17 Pro than it was on the A16 Bionic on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\nAs with last year's iPhone 14 Pro Max (pictured above) in the US, my test unit was eSIM-only. It's incredibly easy to transfer your phone number from an existing phone to these new eSIM variants, but it also means you can no longer easily swap in and out SIM cards without carrier assistance and support.\n\nThis is also a 5G phone, though your 5G experience will depend largely on the proximity of cell towers and how many people are sharing them. Lately, 5G speeds are making me pine for still-under-development 6G.\n\nCall quality is good. My wife remarked I sounded good, clear, and \"younger\". I don't know if that's a product of the connection or if the iPhone 15 Pro Max includes a time machine for free; if it's the latter, Apple should adjust its marketing to place a little more emphasis on that particular upgrade.\n\nThis is also Apple's first Wi-Fi 6E iPhone, which is good news if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router in your home or office. In my anecdotal tests, the iPhone 15 Pro Max had consistently faster download and upload speeds (as measured by Google's online Speet Test) than the WiFi 6-supporting iPhone 15 and my iPhone 14 Pro (also WiFi 6).\n\nThere's also a new Ultra Wide-band chip (across all iPhone 15 models) that should help with precision finding of not only your Apple stuff but other friends carrying iPhones too.\n\nApple is also expanding its integrated Satellite services support beyond Emergency SOS to free (for two years) roadside assistance. The idea is that in areas where cell service is poor or non-existent, the system can guide you to connect with an orbiting satellite and then message nearby road services.\nPerformance score: 4.5 / 5\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Software\n\n    iOS 17 out the box\n    Nice quality-of-life improvements\n    No major changes otherwise\n\niOS 17, which will come pre-installed on your new iPhone 15 Pro Max is, in total, a relatively lightweight update to what is already a very rich and deep platform, of which I suspect most iPhone owners barely scratch the surface.\n\nThe StandBy feature turns the iPhone 15 Pro Max into one of the best bedside clocks and at-a-glance-info hubs around. New Contact Posters are a nice extension of some of the features first found in the impressive Lock Screen update. I also like the new Name Drop feature, which utilizes AirDrop to instantly share contact information with another iPhone placed next to it. Just know that this feature is on by default and if you have two phones near each other with this enabled it might automatically connect. If and when you get your iPhone 15 (of any model), I'd suggest you go into settings and turn this off until you learn how and when to use it.\n\nWhen I made a FaceTime call – which looked fantastic, by the way – I used iOS 17's new gestures to send thumbs ups and balloons, some of which appeared behind me; it was a neat effect.\nSoftware score: 4.5 / 5\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Battery life\n\n    Same quoted battery life as iPhone 14 Pro Max\n    Marginally larger capacity YoY\n    USB-C charging (and data speeds up to 10Gbps)\n    Power adapter not included\n    MagSafe for iPhone\n\nApple never shares the battery capacity and one can only assume that the iPhone 15 Pro Max battery is at least as big as the one in the iPhone 14 Pro Max (independent sources suggest it's fractionally larger). Battery size, though, is only part of the story. Managing battery life is a product of mAhs (milliampere-hours), processor efficiency, and onboard intelligence (often AI-based), to manage battery consumption.\n\nAll of this, I would say, is done well on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which managed 28 hours of mixed-use. This is an anecdotal measure and your results will vary depending on what you do with the phone. Remember that part of my time with the phone was not using it while I slept for five hours (I did not charge it).\n\nApple says the iPhone 15 Pro Max can recharge to 50% in 30 minutes with an optional 20W USB-C adapter. Mine charged 47% in that time. It took another hour and a half for it to fully charge. I'm not sure why Apple can't get fully on board with faster wired charging.\n\nAs for how you charge the iPhone 15 Pro Max, now you'll use the new USB-C port and the included USB-C cable. I was surprised to see that the cable is now woven – as opposed to the classic plastic/rubber protective jacket. This is similar to MacBook and HomePod cables and may prove more durable than the old cables.\n\nThe phone also supports Qi and, obviously MagSafe charging (and accessories).\nBattery score: 4 / 5\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: Verdict\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max raises the bar, not only for the iPhone family but for smartphones in general. From the new materials to some of the best smartphone cameras we have ever used; Apple's big flagship satisfies your smartphone needs in virtually every aspect. It falls just short of perfection thanks to a slightly higher price tag than the last model, the lack of true fast charging, and Apple's frustrating insistence in presenting 5x optical zoom as the apex of smartphone telephoto technology.  Still, these end up being minor quibbles for a broadly exceptional iPhone experience. \n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou want the best iPhone ever\nThere's now a difference between the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max that goes beyond size and battery life. The best possible collection of cameras is on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nYou like your phones big\nApple's 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display is one of the best in the smartphone business. It's fast, flexible (thanks to the 1Hz-to-120Hz ProMotion display) and works as a great canvas for productivity, entertainment and gaming.\n\nYou want excellent photos\nThe quality of photos the phone's 48MP main sensor produces is a new benchmark for smartphone photography.\n \nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou're on a budget\nApple didn't so much raise the price of the iPhone 15 Pro Max as it took away a slightly more affordable option. If money is an object, look at the iPhone 15 or last year's iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nYou want more zoom\nIf 10x optical zoom is a must-have for your smartphone needs, then look to the still-excellent Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, instead.\n\nYou want faster charging\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max offers reassuringly-solid battery life and functionally-fine charging, but rivals from every angle offer much faster speeds. Apple still hasn't caught on, though.\n\niPhone 15 Pro Max review: also consider\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra \nIf the myriad of mentions didn't give it away, the most like-minded rival to the 15 Pro Max right now remains Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra. It can zoom further, boasts a larger battery and stylus support too.\n\nGoogle Pixel 7 Pro*\nGoogle's current flagship boasts and excellent similar-sized display, a clean take on Android, designed by Google itself and a camera experience that stands ahead of its competitive price tag. *The caveat is that the Pixel 8 Pro is set to arrive on October 4.\n\niPhone 14 Pro Max\nSome phones don't hold up the further from launch you get, but Apple's previous flagship will not only cost you less but still deliver a great all-round experience.\n\nHow I tested the iPhone 15 Pro Max\n\nI tested the iPhone 15 Pro Max for four days, using it to take pictures, play games, watch videos, listen to music, and do a variety of other mobile tasks. I ran anecdotal battery tests and various benchmarks, but I have also included benchmark and battery results from Future Labs.\n\nI bring almost 20 years of phone testing experience and 32 years of technology media experience to my review work and have tried or reviewed almost every iPhone since Apple first released them in 2007.",

        "articleBody": "Blu-ray in beast mode \n\nIt’s true that the arrival of the best streaming services has rendered disc formats like Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray unnecessary for some. But studios continue to issue movies both new and old on disc on a regular basis, and there are plenty of independent labels that license obscure and cult titles from studios for release in deluxe packaging with loads of extras. \n\nPut simply, Blu-ray is here to stay for the foreseeable future, and we couldn’t be happier about that. But while there’s still a steady supply of new discs, the best 4K Blu-ray players have become scarce, with most AV manufacturers ceasing to make new players, or limiting production to a single model. \n\nThat’s why it’s always great to hear about the arrival of a new 4K Blu-ray player on the market. Magnetar released its first player, the UDP800, in 2022, and has now followed up with a new flagship model, the UDP900. At €2,500 euros (around $2,700 / £2,200 / AU$4,100), the UDP900 is priced around $1,000 higher than the UDP800, making it the most expensive player we know of.\n\nWhat does the Magnetar UDP900 have going on inside to justify its high price? In this case, it’s not just what’s inside, but also what’s outside. According to the company, the UDP900 has an “all-aluminum alloy body and a reinforced double layer chassis structure.” Its internal components are also independently shielded by metal casing to reduce vibration and noise, and dual 60W toroidal transformer power supplies are onboard for the player’s analog audio output.\n\nSuch rugged build quality would be the reason Magnetar’s player measures 17.5 x 5.2 x 12 inches (W x H x D) and weighs 34 pounds. In the dwindling world of 4K Blu-ray players, the UDP900 is an utter beast.\n\nInside the UDP900 is an ESS9038PRO digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for the player’s analog stereo XLR output and ESS9028PRO DAC for its 7.1-channel analog RCA output. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ high dynamic range formats are supported, and the UDP900 can play SACDs and regular CDs along with Blu-ray, 4K Blu-ray, and DVD discs.\n\nIn addition to its dual HDMI outputs (one video/audio and one audio-only), the UDP900 also has a USB type-B DAC input to connect a computer for audio playback.\n\nAnalysis: Why buy a Blu-ray player, especially a high-priced one? \n\nThere’s no dispute that streaming is convenient, and that much of the world has opted to go that route for its movie and music consumption. But the Blu-ray disc format remains viable, with new regular Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray discs being released on a weekly basis. Some of these are deluxe editions aimed at collectors such as Criterion’s recent 4K remaster of Terry Gilliam’s The Fisher King from 1991. But others are recent movies such as Best Picture Oscar Nominees All Quiet on the Western Front and Triangle of Sadness.\n\nIf you are a Blu-ray collector, it makes sense to own the best disc player possible to ensure you will have a reliable, ruggedly built machine to play your discs on well into the future. That’s why I don’t necessarily flinch at the Magnetar UDP900’s sky-high price, though there are more reasonably priced high-performance player options such as the Panasonic DP-UB900.\n\nWhat the UDP900 brings to the table, aside from unassailable build quality, is a focus on both audio and video performance. Along with support for both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ high dynamic range formats, it has a balanced analog XLR output and dedicated toroidal transformer power supply for each stereo channel. That means it should be an outstanding player for Compact Discs along with Blu-rays and 4K Blu-rays, and it also supports the audiophile SACD format.\n\nOne of my treasured AV possessions is an Oppo UDP-203 4K Blu-ray player, which was the last model that Oppo made before shutting down its Blu-ray player manufacturing operation, reportedly because the facility was needed to produce phones for the Indian market. \n\nThe Oppo Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray players were rugged and reliable, and their excellent build quality and performance justified their higher cost compared to other players. And while Magnetar’s ask for the UDP900 is undoubtedly high, I also have no doubt that it’s the kind of player you’ll still be using decades from now.",

        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Vigorous recycling, repurposing, and alternative operating systems will likely take care of most of that waste\n\nIn a nutshell: Researchers warn that up to 240 million PCs could wind up in landfills after Microsoft ends support for Windows 10. The rationale here is that Windows 11 hardware restrictions will render all of these computers obsolete. However, older computers have been going obsolete for decades, and current recycling efforts are much more robust than in past years. So, will it be a real problem?\n\nWindows 11's strict hardware requirements have received their fair share of controversy since launching in late 2021. Initially, Microsoft warned of compatibility issues, which didn't go over too well, and saw users finding ways around the hardware checks. It's raising further concerns as Windows 10 approaches end-of-life (EOL) status.\n\nTechnology research firm Canalys reports that when Microsoft sunsets Windows 10 in 2025, it could send as many as 240 million PCs to the scrap heap. Reuters estimates the dump would equate to 480 million kilograms of e-waste. For perspective, it adds that such a dump is equivalent to about 320,000 automobiles.\n\n\"Microsoft's decision will worsen the industry's e-waste problem and highlights the role of OS vendors in enabling circular IT models,\" notes Canalys. \"Microsoft's Windows 11 will help support a struggling PC market as customers prepare for another refresh cycle – but the termination of Windows 10 support could prevent hundreds of millions of devices from getting second lives, leaving many liable to end up in landfill [sic].\"\n\nHowever, the entirety of 240 million computers will not likely land in garbage dumps in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft has already announced it will offer extended security updates for Windows 10 to 2028. Of course, continuing EOL coverage is neither free nor cheap. Only a fraction of customers with obsolete PCs, primarily businesses, will shell out for it. Microsoft also stands to gain from the refreshed demand for Windows 11 that Win10's sunsetting brings.\n\nThen there is Linux and repurposing to consider. A small to moderate number of Windows 10 machines will see new life as Linux computers and servers. Others will continue running Win10 for functions like testing and research. Air gapped networks reduce the need for new security updates and allow Windows 10 to remain viable indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, many – maybe even most – users will recycle their e-waste. Even some of the smallest communities have e-waste drives at least once per year. Others have full-time recycling centers devoted to scrapping and reclaiming components and rare-earth elements from discarded PCs and other electronics, which helps with the ongoing shortages of these manufacturing resources.\n\nHard drives and other components provide materials manufacturers can use in EV production or power generation structures, like windmills.\n\n\"Turning end-of-life computers into the magnets that power sustainable technologies like electric vehicles and wind turbines will help meet the rising global demand for electricity,\" Noveon Magnetics Chief Commercial Officer Peter Afiuny told Reuters.\n\nRecyclers can also reclaim metals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper from the batteries inside discarded computers to make more batteries for new electronics. Other materials like aluminum and plastics can be recycled for use in various other products.\n\nWhile 240 million is a considerable number of obsolete computers, only a fraction will end up in landfills after Win10 enters EOL status on October 14, 2025, as Canalys worries. Modern e-waste recycling and repurposing should take care of most of the projected waste going to landfills.",

        "title": "Path Tracing vs. Ray Tracing, Explained",
        "authors": "Nick Evanson",
        "date": "2023-11-30",
        "articleBody": "Every few years, it seems like there's an amazing new technology with the promise of making games look ever more realistic. Over the decades, we've had shaders, tessellation, shadow mapping, ray tracing – and now there's a new kid on the block: path tracing.\n\nSo if you're looking for the skinny on this latest development in graphics technology, you've come to the right place. Let's dive into the world of rendering and follow a path of light and learning.\n\nWhat is path tracing?\n\nThe short and sweet answer to this question is... \"path tracing is just ray tracing.\" The equations for modeling the behavior of light are the same, the use of data structures to accelerate the searching for ray-triangle interactions are the same, too, and modern GPUs use the same units to accelerate the process. It's also very computationally intensive.\n\nBut, wait. If it's really the same, why does path tracing have a different name, and what benefit does it offer game programmers? Path tracing differs from ray tracing in that instead of following lots of rays, throughout an entire scene, the algorithm only traces the most likely path for the light.\n\nWe've explored how rays works (see: A Deeper Dive: Rasterization and Ray Tracing), but a brief whiz through the process is required here. The frame starts off as normal: the graphics card renders all of the geometry – all of the triangles that make up the scene – and saves it to memory.\n\nAfter a little bit of further processing, to organize the information in such a way that the geometry can be searched quicker, the ray tracing kicks in. For each pixel that comprises the frame, a single ray is cast from the camera, out into the scene.\n\nWell, not in a literal sense – a vector equation is generated, with parameters set on the basis of where the camera and pixel are. Each ray is then checked against the scene's geometry and this is the first part of ray tracing's complexity. Fortunately, the latest GPUs from AMD and Nvidia come with dedicated hardware units to accelerate this process.\n\nIf a ray and object do interact, another calculation is done to work out exactly what triangle in the model is involved, and the color of the triangle will effectively modify the color of the pixel.\n\nBut light rarely hits an object and that light gets completely absorbed. In reality, there's a lot of reflection and refraction going on, so if you want the most realistic rendering possible, new vector equations are generated, one each for the reflected and refracted rays.\n\nIn turn, those rays get traced until they also hit an object, and the sequence continues until a chain of rays is finally bounced all the way back to a source of light in the scene. From the original primary ray, the total number of rays traced across the scene grows exponentially with every bounce.\n\nRinse and repeat across all of the other pixels in the frame, and the end result is a realistically lit scene... although a fair bit of additional processing is still needed to tidy up the final image.\n\nBut even with the most powerful of GPUs and CPUs, a fully ray traced frame takes an enormous amount of time to make – far, far longer than a traditionally rendered one, using compute and pixel shaders.\n\nNow this is where path tracing fits into the picture, if one pardons the pun.\n\nWhen more work means less work\n\nThe initial concept of path tracing was introduced by James Kajiya way back in 1986, while he was a researcher for Caltech. He showed that the problem of having a processor being ground to halt, working through an ever increasing number of rays, could be solved through the use of statistical sampling of scene (specifically, Monte Carlo algorithms).\n\nTraditional ray tracing involves calculating the exact path of reflection or refraction of each ray, and tracing them all the way back to one or more light sources. With path tracing, multiple rays are generated for each pixel but they're bounced off in a random direction. This gets repeated when a ray hits an object, and keeps on occurring until a light source is reached or a preset bounce limit is reached.\n\nThis in itself probably doesn't seem like a huge change in the amount of computing required, so where's the magic part?\n\nNot all of the rays will be used to create the final color of the pixel in the frame. Only a certain number of them will be sampled and the algorithm uses results in an almost ideal path of light bounces, from camera to light source. One can then scale the number of samples for each pixel, to adjust the accuracy of the final image.\n\nDespite an extra pile of math and coding being involved, the end result is that there are far fewer rays to process, even though path tracing typically fires off dozens of rays per pixel. Tracking rays and carrying out their interaction calculations are the reason for the performance hit, in comparison to normal rendering, so using fewer rays to color a pixel is clearly a good thing.\n\nBut here's the really clever part: ordinarily fewer rays would result in a less realistic lighting, but since the bulk of the color of the frame's pixels are only affected by the primary rays, dumping most or all of the secondary ones doesn't affect things as much as one might think.\n\nNow, if the scene does contain lots of surfaces that will reflect and refract light, such as glass or water, then those secondary rays do become important. To get around this problem, either the algorithm is tweaked to account for the distribution of ray types one should be getting in a scene, or those specific surfaces are handled in their own 'fully ray traced' rendering pass.\n\nA good developer will use the full gamut of rendering tools at their dispense: rasterization with shaders, path tracing, and full ray tracing. It's a lot more work to figure this all out, but it's ultimately less work for the hardware to deal with.\n\nWhy is path tracing in the news right now?\n\nSeveral times over the past few years we've seen headlines about mods adding ray tracing to old classics, but most of those actually refer to path tracing. We heard it back in 2019 with an experimental mod for Crysis and Quake 2, or more recently with the unofficial Half-Life ray tracing mod, the Classic Doom mod, Descent, and many others. All path tracing.\n\nThere was also the tweet from a senior R&D graphics engineer at AMD, who announced his project to update the original Return to Castle Wolfenstein game with a path traced renderer. \n\nAs noted above, Nvidia's Quake II remaster sporting a ray traced renderer was launched to help promote RTX technology. This was initially the work of one person, Christoph Schied, who created the remaster (technically known as Q2VKPT) as part of a research project. With contributions from other experts in graphics technology, Quake II RTX was born, and was the first renown game to use path tracing for all its lighting.\n\nThe original models and textures are still present and the only aspect that was changed was how surfaces were lit and shadows generated. Static images aren't the best medium for demonstrating how effective the new lighting model is, but you can grab a free copy for yourself, or check out this video...\n\nBandying cools phrases such as stochastic multiple importance sampling and variance reduction algorithms, the project highlighted two things: first of all, path tracing looks seriously cool, and secondly, it's still seriously tough on developers and hardware alike. If you want to see just how complex the math is, have a read of Chapter 47 of Ray Tracing Gems II.\n\nBut where the likes of Quake II RTX shows what can be achieved path tracing everything, the likes of Control and Cyberpunk 2077 demonstrate that incredible graphics are achievable through blending all methods of lighting and shadowing – rasterization and shaders still rule the roost, with ray tracing for reflections and shadows.\n\nSo we're still some way off before we see all games rendered using nothing but path tracing.\n\nFollowing the path to a better future\n\nDespite its relatively newness in the world of real-time rendering, path tracing is definitely here to stay. We've already seen the results in the one game and path tracing is already heavily used in offline renders, such as Blender, as well as the movie industry, with the likes of Autodesk Arnold and Pixar's RenderMan.\n\nThere are no signs of GPUs nearing any kind of limit to their maximum computing power just yet, so while ray tracing, traditional or path tracing, is still very demanding, more powerful hardware will come to market over the years.\n\nAll of which means that developers of future PC games are certainly going to explore any rendering technique that produces amazing graphics at an achievable performance, and path tracing has the potential to do just that.\n\nThere are consoles to consider, too. The Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 both offer support for 'traditional' ray tracing, but given that their GPUs will be relatively outdated in just a few years time, developers will be looking to make use of every possible shortcut to squeeze the last dregs of power out of those machines, before moving on to the next generation of consoles.\n\nSo there you have – path tracing, the fast cousin of ray tracing. Looks almost as good, works a heck of a lot quicker. Given the continued advances of home PC and console graphics technology and performance, it won't be long before we'll see computer graphics from the latest blockbusters in our favorite games, too.",

        "articleBody": "Lucia dreaded interacting with her colleague Ray. Meetings that were scheduled for an hour would last two; once Ray started talking, he wouldn’t stop. “There’s no doubt he was a smart man,” Lucia says, “but he did little more than talk about everything he knew. He delegated almost all of his work to others.”\n\nMost of us have dealt with a Ray, the know-it-all who is convinced they’re the smartest person in the room, hogs airtime in meetings and has no qualms about interrupting others. They gleefully inform you of what’s right, even if they’re clearly wrong, lacking information or fail to understand the nuances of a situation.\n\nHere are some of the signs of the know-it-all:\n• Monopolizes conversations, refusing to be interrupted and talking over others\n• Does not listen to or heed criticism or feedback\n• Speaks in a condescending tone\n• Explains things that others already understand\n• Rarely asks questions or displays curiosity\n• Steals or doesn’t share credit for group successes\n\nOne reason know-it-alls exist in so many workplaces is that many organizations reward people who act as if they have all the answers. Do employees who state their ideas with conviction tend to get more support for those ideas at your job? If people appear uncertain, are they considered weak? In many cultures, decision-making is a competitive sport, rather than a collaborative effort, so acting like you know everything is a shrewd survival technique.\n\nSo how can you make your interactions with your know-it-all coworker not just less annoying but less damaging?\nFirst, answer these four questions before taking action.\nQuestion 1: Are they trying to prove something?\n\nThere’s a good chance your colleague’s egotism is compensating for some deficiency or fear. Considering their underlying insecurities may give you some clues about how to deal with them. For example, some know-it-alls might be constantly talking about what they accomplished in their last role as a way to demonstrate their value. If you understand that, you might make a point of validating the contributions they’re already making, freeing them from the need to tout their past achievements.\nQuestion 2: Is their confidence warranted?\n\nYour know-it-all colleague might have good reason to be confident in their assertions or claims, even if their demeanor leaves something to be desired. Could it be that their delivery is abrasive, but their underlying points have merit?\nQuestion 3: Is bias playing a role in how I’m perceiving them?\n\nWe all hold biases about who is cut out to hold positions of power. And when someone doesn’t fit our preconceptions of leadership, we tend to question whether their confidence is justified. For example, research has shown that women of color have to prove their expertise over and over. Is the person you’re labeling as a know-it-all from an underestimated group? Do they belong to a culture or demographic that you have unconscious but negative biases about?\nQuestion 4: Is their confidence pushing your buttons?\n\nI admit that the stronger someone feels about something, the more I feel resistant to their argument, especially if their view threatens my values in some way. Ask yourself whether your reaction to your colleague has more to do with you than it does with them. Is it possible that you feel insecure when you compare your accomplishments to theirs? Or maybe you wish that you were as confident or sure minded as they are? Is their behavior causing real issues for you or the team? Or is it just annoying? Distinguish between statements or actions that are irritating and behavior that is preventing you from getting your work done.\n\nAfter you can get a sense of where they’re coming from — and what role your preferences and biases may be playing in your attitude towards them — change your working relationship by trying one of these tactics.\nTactic 1: Appreciate what they have to offer\n\nYou may need to dig deep to find it, but there is probably some genuine knowledge or capability behind the know-it-all’s overconfidence. Sure, they may exaggerate their skills and successes but find the kernel of truth. And if the ultimate goal of their pretentiousness is approval or acceptance, your empathy and appreciation may help them let up on the “Look-how-much-I-know!” routine.\nTactic 2: Prevent interruptions\n\nMost know-it-alls have an annoying habit of constantly interrupting people. One way to deal with it is to preemptively request that people refrain from interjecting. Before you start talking, explain how much time (roughly) you’re going to need and say something like, “Please hold any comments or questions until I’m done.” If you’re not making a formal presentation but are just having a discussion where some back-and-forth is expected, you might say instead, “Interruptions break my concentration, so I’d appreciate it if you’d let me finish my thoughts before jumping in.”\nTactic 3: When interruptions do occur, tactfully address them\n\nIf your efforts to preempt interruptions fail, address them directly. But don’t just raise your voice. That sets up a power struggle and your colleague is likely to talk louder in an attempt to drown you out. Instead, confidently say, “I’m going to finish my point, and then I’d love to hear what you have to say.”\n\nIf you don’t feel comfortable speaking up, enlist allies. It’s often easier for someone else to confront rudeness, saying something like, “I’d love to hear what Keith was saying before we move on,” or “I don’t think Madison was finished with her point.” If the know-it-all interrupts multiple people on your team, you could agree to speak up for each other when it happens.\nTactic 4: Set norms\n\nOne norm that I’ve been using when I’m teaching a workshop or giving a talk to a group where people will be interacting with one another (especially on Zoom) is to “take space, make space.”\n\nThe idea is that if you tend to be someone who stays quiet in meetings, you should challenge yourself to voice your opinions. If you’re someone who is prone to holding the floor, try to step back and make room for others to contribute. I’ve found that sharing this idea at the beginning results in a more equitably distributed meeting. This could be one of several norms you and your team agree on. Having established guidelines will discourage interruptions and make it safe for everyone to speak up.\nTactic 5: Ask for facts and data\n\nAnother irritating habit of the know-it-all is to proclaim: “Our customers expect us to deliver new features every six months.” “Sales are dropping because we aren’t quick enough to respond to complaints.” “In a year, no one will even be talking about this election.” If you’re sitting there wondering how they know that, it’s OK to ask for sources or data that back up their declarations.\n\nBe respectful, not confrontational when doing this. You might say something like “I’m not sure we’re working with the same assumptions and facts. Let’s step back and take a look at the data before we proceed.”\n\nEven if your domineering colleague doesn’t respond well to these kinds of inquiries the first few times, they may come to expect your requests for evidence and think twice before blurting out unsubstantiated claims. And asking them to explain how they know something may help them see the limits of their knowledge and encourage some humility in the future.\n\nWhen you’re meeting with a know-it-all, show up with verified facts in hand. The more prepared you are to defend your perspective and to counter any misleading statements they make, the better. You’ll also be reinforcing the importance of fact-based discussions over posturing.\nTactic 6: Model humility and an open mind\n\nMany show-offs act the way they do because it’s worked for them in the past or because implicitly or explicitly they’ve received messages that projecting confidence is what’s expected on your team, in your organization, or in the culture they’re from. You can provide a different model by displaying humility and open-mindedness. Try saying, “I don’t know” or “I don’t have that information right now; let me get back to you.”\n\nIf the know-it-all sees that you suffer no consequences for expressing uncertainty, they may be willing to do the same. You can even prompt them to be humbler by encouraging everyone to come to meetings having thought through the pros and cons of solutions or ideas they want to propose. Or you can ask questions like:\n• What’s another viewpoint?\n• If we tried to see this from another perspective, what might we think?\n• What are the benefits and risks of this approach?\n\nBecause some know-it-alls are seeking validation, simply acknowledging their ideas can prevent grandstanding. Thank them for sharing their thoughts or highlight one or two things you appreciate about their perspective before sharing yours or diving in with questions. For instance, you might say, “That’s a useful point. I agree with the first part of what you said, and I see the second part slightly differently. Let’s talk that through.”\n\nWorking with a know-it-all is irritating at best and career-limiting at worst. But you don’t need to sit back and suffer. You can take steps to curb your colleague’s bluster or at least lessen its impact on you and others.",

        "authors": "Klaus Sieg",
        "date": "2023-08-12",
        "articleBody": "Roman Hottgenroth is surrounded by lamps, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners. Computers, smartphones and TV receivers are piled high on tin shelves behind him. A group of washing machines rattles loudly in test mode, only somewhat drowned out by the bass thumping from a hi-fi system an employee is checking.\n\nNone of these products work properly, and that’s the point. \n\nHere at Stilbruch, the department store in Hamburg, Germany run by the city’s sanitation department, only goods that others have thrown away are offered up for sale. But before they are sold, they are checked and, if necessary, repaired in Hottgenroth’s 7,500-square-foot workshop. The process is something of a dying art. “Unfortunately, [repair] is no longer intended for most appliances,” says Hottgenroth, Stilbruch’s operations manager. \n\nBut that may be changing. Across Europe, legislation is pushing back against a waste-based economy and restoring something that companies have gradually taken away from citizens: The right to repair what they’ve bought.\n\nHottgenroth sees every day how many appliances end up in the trash. Although often all they need is a fresh battery or receiver, “spare parts are hard to come by, and all the components are soldered, glued or riveted,” he says. This is why, while his employees can fix many products, many others are unsalvageable. “Because of their design, devices often break just when you try to open them.” In addition, there is usually no longer any provision for upgrading and adapting devices to new technical standards.\n\n“This should be banned,” Hottgenroth says flatly.\n\nSome political leaders agree. In November, the EU Parliament called on the European Commission to make routine repair of everyday products easier, systematic and cost-efficient. It said that warranties should be extended, and that replacement parts should be improved and made more accessible, as should information enabling general repair and maintenance.  \n\nThe EU’s existing eco-design regulations could be an instrument to reach these goals. These mandates were established years ago to improve the energy efficiency of products sold in the EU.\n\nBut in March, the first eco-design regulation that will define standards for repair and useful life will come into force. Manufacturers of washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and monitors will have to ensure that components are replaceable with common tools. Instruction manuals must be accessible to specialist companies. And producers must supply spare parts within 15 days. \n\nCell phones, computers and tablets, however, have not yet been regulated by an EU eco-design directive, and constitute some of the most harmful consumer waste. To this end, individual member states have moved ahead with their own regulations.\n\nThis month, France will introduce an anti-waste law with a repair index. A grade of 1 through 10 will appear on the labels of washing machines, laptops, smartphones, TVs and lawnmowers. This score will be calculated based on criteria such as ease of disassembly, access to repair information, and price and availability of spare parts. The French government is also promoting modular product design and is aiming to have 60 percent of electronic equipment in France be repairable by 2026. \n\nEurope is one of the largest markets in the world, which means that new EU design guidelines and right to repair mandates could force manufacturers across the world to make more durable products. The shift can’t come soon enough. At over 10 million tons per year, e-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in Europe. In Germany alone, two million tons are generated annually. Repairing products and extending their useful life could play a key role in mitigating the environmental consequences of all this waste.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what a large majority of EU citizens want. Nearly 80 percent would rather repair their devices than replace them. And a majority think that manufacturers should be legally obliged to facilitate the repair of digital devices or the replacement of their individual parts.\n\nSuch products have existed for some time — companies like Fairphone and Shiftphone produce sustainable, repairable smartphones, for instance. But with the EU’s new legislative mandates on the horizon, bigger players are getting ahead of the game.\n\nApple has launched a repair program for independent businesses, in which companies can get Apple parts, tools, training, service guides, diagnostics and resources to perform a variety of out-of-warranty repairs. Last year the German outdoor gear company Vaude began providing customers with an index showing how repairable each of its products are. Electrolux, a leading manufacturer of electrical appliances in Europe, has been preparing for the directive and will be ready to comply once it takes effect in March.\n\n“We will now ensure that the specific parts, according to the legislation, will be available directly to consumers,” says Viktor Sundberg, vice president of European & environmental affairs at Electrolux. “And we will make the repair information available to independent repairers for the categories requested.” \n\nIs that sufficient? For Dorothea Kessler of iFixit Europe, the EU Parliament has indeed sent a strong signal that the continent must embrace a more sustainable circular economy. But it’s only a start. “We will certainly have to wait a few more years for feasible measures to emerge for the most important product categories,” she says. In the process, she believes it won’t be easy for the EU to stand up to the manufacturers’ lobbies. \n\nConsumer and environmental organizations have also welcomed the EU Parliament resolution with cautious optimism. “The right to repair was already in the Green Deal of December 2019 as a buzzword,” says Elke Salzmann of the Federation of Consumer Organizations in Germany, referring to Europe’s commitment to become the first climate-neutral continent. “But we have to take care that the promise will be obliging.”\n\nIn the meantime, iFixit has been assigning a repairability rating to every new device on the market for years and provides free step-by-step instructions for do-it-yourself repairs in 11 languages for 70,000 products. Its online forum allows users to exchange ideas with other tinkerers.\n\nThe online community, founded in California, now has three million monthly users in Europe and ten million worldwide. To Kessler, it’s a movement that has as much to do with altering mindsets as fixing gadgets. “Our philosophy is that something doesn’t belong to you if you can’t open it,” she says.",

        "articleBody": "Our Africa's New Wave package celebrates the rich culture and impact of the globe's demographically youngest continent. Through a series of visual stories, we're unpacking the gravity of Africa's history and influence on the world and why it needs to be looked to as a source of inspiration for radical youth-focused change.\n\nDaniel Benson, known by his stage name Bnxn, is enjoying a rare sunny day in London. “It’s giving a little bit of Lagos,” he tells Teen Vogue. “I don't usually like this place because it's always very cold.”\n\nBnxn (pronounced like Benson) is in London to shoot a commercial for Coca-Cola, beginning a summer that will take him through the next big reintroduction of his career. Come the fall, he’ll release his debut album, Sincerely, Benson, and further cement his place as a global force in music — a feat even more impressive considering that he’s an independent artist. The Afro-fusion musician has quickly become one of the most prominent voices of New Age Afrobeats, joining the likes of fellow Teen Vogue cover stars Ayra Starr and Victony — plus artists like Rema, Bloody Civilian, Omah Lay, and Ckay — who are constantly defining what Afrobeats will become.\n\nIt’s the middle of June, the early days of summer, and the 26-year-old artist is posted up at a cafe in West London, his favorite part of the city. The houses are bigger, the streets free of the hustle and bustle of Central London. That may be “where the fun is,” he admits, but he’s drawn to the former neighborhood’s sense of calm order. He’s entering a different phase in his life. Here, he seems to be taking things as they come, finally settling into his own skin. He’s come a long way from the eager-eyed 22-year-old who entered the Afrobeats music industry with a ravenous hunger that kept him on his toes for quite some time. Right now, his feet are firmly planted.\n\nThere’s a certain boisterousness in Bnxn's voice, in his life as it is now. His mood is light and cheerful and he punctuates his sentences with urban Naija-speak and carries some of his words with a bright chuckle. He didn’t always know he would dedicate his life to music, but it has followed Bnxn since he was a kid. “My dad had a long-ranging collection, from dancehall to reggae,” says Bnxn, who grew up listening to Bob Marley and Lucky Dube as well as Nigerian music. “[One day] it was D’banj, [then] it was some traditional musician from my state Akwa Ibom.” This early education made him receptive to new sounds. It explains why he doesn’t shy away from exploring various genres, from Amapiano to classic Afro-pop and Nigerian street pop.\n\nBnxn spent much of his early childhood in Gbagada, a middle-class, residential area of Lagos, before moving with his family to nearby Ogun State. His father had wanted the family to get away from the rambunctious energy of Lagos, Bnxn tells Teen Vogue. In secondary school, he started rapping under the moniker Drizzle. He eventually moved on from rapping and joined a school choir. “The choir helped me identify my voice and shape it a little bit. I started singing in tenor and it was really great to know that there was a position for the type of voice I had,” he says. He found himself soloing in their performances at major school events. “I overcame performance fear at a very early age.”\n\nWhen he enrolled as a theater arts student at Babcock University in Nigeria in 2014, Bnxn took a break from music and then returned three years later for an internship that he hated. He spent his time writing and making music instead. The day he got fired from the internship, Bnxn remembers listening to Buju Banton — a perfect signal for where his destiny lay.\n\nBnxn's original stage name was Buju; in 2022, he changed his name in a bid to avoid being mistaken for Banton, which happened often. He remembers hanging out at a club with the artist Burna Boy, who partially inspired this need for reintroduction. “I feel like you need to make a standpoint of that name,” he remembers Burna telling him.\n\nBurna Boy has played a significant role in Bnxn's life, first as an inspiration during his come-up, then as a collaborator. The pair met formally in 2020 after Burna Boy’s team reached out to him to work on the remix of Bnxn’s hit song, “L’enu.” The meeting led to them quarantining together during the early days of the pandemic and living together for most of 2020. “Understanding his person was a whole experience, especially watching [Burna Boy] record the Grammy-winning album, Twice As Tall,\" Bnxn says. “There's a whole lot I got to understand and experience. He's a beast. He's someone who's so focused, especially when it comes to the craft itself.”\n\nLike the man he looks up to, Bnxn has always approached music-making with striking intentionality. In his EP Sorry I’m Late (2021), Bnxn draws a groovy narrative around trying to appease fans who had been asking for a full-length project. “There was even a voice note from somebody demanding music. I’d never felt like that before,” he told Apple Music in 2021. He turned the pressure into diamonds and songs like “Kilometre” and “Never Stopped” were added to the stack of hit records he had been accumulating.\n\nWhen he finally did drop that debut album in 2022, Bad Since 97 established Bnxn as an Afrobeats heavyweight. His goal was to stake a formal claim in an evolving soundscape — to bring a dexterity to music-making and a keen attention to lyric writing that is rare to find in the Afrobeats landscape. His tone and lyricism, suffused with witty relatability and imagery, have greatly contributed to his rise. \n\nIn all of this, Bnxn has stayed true to his Afro-fusion background, refusing to stick to a specific sound and choosing instead to infuse his work with a recognizable sense of his Nigerian identity. His lyrics are peppered with pidgin and local languages including Yoruba; beyond that, the wittiness in and of his writing is sometimes rooted in a cheeky camaraderie and colorful storytelling where Nigerians excel.\n\nBnxn’s most impressive power lies in his ability to turn gritty lyricism into soft, lush landscapes. His songs are deliciously oxymoronic. Whether he is singing about hustling in Lagos or getting high at a club, his nasal yet mellow voice transforms these instances into moments of pensive longing. Bnxn attributes these wistful elements to real experiences, like toxic relationships from his past. “It might come out as sad because it's real,” he says.\n\nAfrobeats music can often feel siloed into strict grittiness; masochistic in storytelling and peppy in sonic delivery. Bnxn, however, is expanding the possibilities of the soundscape. He’s one of a class of artists making music draped in the casual vulnerability that pioneers before them often avoided. Take “Loose Emotions,” a bouncy Afro-pop track off his debut album where he sings, “Here's how you lose emotion, something you should know,” unpacking the last pieces of a romantic fallout.\n\nBnxn has written songs about his childhood neighborhood, Gbagada, and spun long-winding narratives about living it up in Gwagwalada, a low-income neighborhood in Nigeria’s capital of Abuja. “I am very in tune with experiences, and places are the only way I can remember what happened where,” he says. “Everywhere I go that gives me a sense or feeling, I have to sing about it. Even ‘Gwagalada,’ I hadn’t been there, but I’d heard so much about it before I sang about it.”\n\nBnxn’s art has an intrinsic sense of place and Lagos in particular is inextricably tied to his music. “I really love living in Lagos, because there's no place like it. Lagos has its own chaos, but I feel like I'm a neighborhood hero in that place now,” he says. “I just live there and make people happy by just being there. Lagos is fun, man. It's full of everything I love.”\n\nIn his forthcoming work, Bnxn is paying closer attention to the shifting gears of his life. “Now I want more groove and lightness. I want people to be introduced to a lot happier side [of me] on the album,” he says. The project, according to the singer, will also be his most sincere. “It's me explaining a lot of the things that have happened to me elaborately,” he says. “I'm breezing through topics of heartbreak, confidence, reminiscing on experiences that have happened in my life.\"\n\nWhen Bnxn thinks about the future of Afrobeats, it’s with a feeling of excitement as well as a sharp sense of how contemporary artists could grow. He feels the privilege of being a part of the new crop of Afrobeats talents, as well as the pressure. “When I started making this path for myself, especially with the kind of music I was making, I wanted people to identify with the sound,” he says. “At the same time, I wanted people to accept it, and it's great to be accepted … I can't even imagine that I'm part of this age where there are people like Omah Lay, like Victony. They're outstanding, they definitely know what they're doing, and that's all I'm about.”\n\nRecently, Bnxn was listening to songs from older Afrobeats artists like 2Baba and Timaya, who, often with well-considered writing, sang pointedly about structural inequities, but also about love and romance. “I was playing songs from back then when people were trying to really prove a point, and God damn!” he says. “Now it's just vibes. People [back then] were dropping punchlines. Right now, there are only a few people who do it.”\n\nCurrently, what’s on his mind more than anything else is longevity. The awards are already coming, notably, a 2022 Headies Award for Next Rated Artist, but they’re not the end goal. “Nice to get,” Bnxn says, “but not something I'm really hoping for. I'm going to get a Grammy just doing what I do.” \n\nHis self-assurance is hard to question. Bnxn has the track record to prove it. “I'm looking for legendary status,” he says simply. “I want to enjoy this and take it to the highest level possible, Grammy or not.”",

        "articleBody": "Teen Vogue's September 2023 cover star offers a glimpse into who she really is beyond public perception.\n\nThe work of a model is inherently storytelling, and in a luminous duplex apartment in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, Aoki Lee Simmons is bringing a new narrative to life.\n\nHer lithe figure is draped across a houndstooth armchair, limbs akimbo as she contorts her way into new shapes. In one moment, her legs extend upward, sending foot-tall, violet Marc Jacob platforms into the cosmos, basically. In the next, she’s upside down, hair delicately sprawled across the floor.\n\nBetween looks, Aoki takes control of the lens, playfully snapping an on-set Polaroid, experimenting with light and dimensions. The daughter of Kimora Lee Simmons may have daunting shoes to fill — or, rather, a vintage Chanel two-piece set — but she seems determined not to let the significance of that overwhelm her, singing along to Doja Cat’s “Like That” to assuage her nerves between frames.\n\nAs she relaxes her body into new silhouettes, the sun beams through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the domestic milieu on set. Aoki soon positions herself so she’s enshrouded in the sun, like a natural spotlight, unrelenting. This shoot is happening on the precipice of her 21st birthday. Aoki Lee Simmons is now the author of her own story.\n\nMany of Aoki’s earliest memories are from being on the runway. The daughter of the St. Louis-born, model-turned-mogul Kimora Lee Simmons and Queens-bred hip-hop legend Russell Simmons, Aoki and her older sister Ming were mainstays in fashion shows for her mom’s streetwear company, Baby Phat. As part of a show finale, the sisters would walk out holding hands with their mother.\n\nAoki was a toddler when she and her sister traipsed partway down the catwalk, charming onlookers, giving a quick wave before turning back around, an occasional twirl added for flair. Already a headstrong child, she treated the limelight as a site for play and experimentation. On one occasion, she walked so far down the platform that the family lawyer tapped her feet to prevent her from falling over the edge.\n\nAs the years progressed, that youthful whimsy evolved into a more guarded relationship with the public. By the time Aoki was a preteen, she had watched every part of her life become public fodder because of her megafamous parents.\n\nKimora Lee and Russell met in 1992, when he — the cofounder of Def Jam Records and manager of the iconic rap group Run DMC — was 35 and she — a successful model and muse of Karl Lagerfeld — was a teenager. They married in 1998, Ming was born in 2000, and Aoki came along in 2002. Kimora Lee’s brand, Baby Phat, started as a sister brand to Russell’s Phat Farm. Both companies gained a significant following in the hip-hop community and the culture at large, with Baby Phat's velour track suits becoming a symbol of It girl '00s style. The couple split in 2006, but their impact had already been cemented.\n\nKimora Lee's E! reality TV series, Life in the Fab Lane, debuted in 2007. It lasted four seasons and documented her life balancing business and motherhood. On the show, we saw Aoki scouring her mother’s closet full of vintage Chanel, bickering with her sister, and even debuting her own fashion collection with Ming at the tender age of 4. Aoki has said that while the show was on air, public input didn’t reach her — she was too young and there was no social media. But as she grew up, those outside voices crept in.\n\nThe fame of their parents meant the eldest Simmons daughters had become enmeshed in the pop culture apparatus, and were firmly in the clutches of the insurmountable beauty standards of the early aughts. That level of scrutiny was a cruel experience for a child, one that several young Black girls in high-profile families have come to know: namely, the girls' cousins, Angela and Vanessa Simmons, and Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s eldest child, Blue Ivy.\n\nWe sit down for lunch at a West Village cafe. Aoki is a bundle of nerves — repeatedly fidgeting with her hair, switching from a ponytail to a bun — but she's also vivacious and an inquisitive conversationalist, thinking faster than she can talk. Nothing about her is low-energy, and we don’t remain seated for long: After we finish our respective bites, we take our talk on the road, going for a “hot girl walk” down Hudson Street, eagerly chatting about the full gamut of young womanhood.\n\nIn May, Aoki graduated from Harvard at just 20 years old. She’s no longer shuttling on trains between Cambridge and New York to model. For now, she is crashing at Ming’s NYC apartment, preparing to book gigs for her first international fashion month — New York, London, Milan, and Paris — in September.\n\nOf course, sharing space with a sibling has led to the occasional squabble over boundaries. “The last time, she made me pay her cleaning fees…. Now, whenever I come and go, I take pictures [before and after] in the drawers, out of the drawers, in the shower.” She intends to look for a place of her own after fashion month.\n\nModeling now seems like a natural fit, but Aoki's current trajectory took her family by surprise. The early brush with the limelight led to her grounding herself in academics. Her mother had put her through a robust schooling curriculum since she was around two years old, and that became a safe haven. She went to boarding school alongside Ming in Switzerland, where she claims her sister was immensely popular in comparison to her more bookish persona, prone to binging episodes of Crash Course History on YouTube.\n\nIn addition to volleyball, tae kwon do, and ballet, Aoki also got into gaming and microcomputers. Her current PC setup is that of a seasoned gamer who used to be an eager participant in a competitive League of Legends team: massive wraparound screen, ergonomic keyboard, and headphones.\n\nKimora Lee's academic encouragement carried on through Aoki's schooling experience. “My mom and I are very academic,” she says. “It was like, my mom and I are planning to go to Harvard.”\n\nAoki graduated high school at 16 because she started schooling early, she says. In collaboration with her mother, she planned her college application process, indeed targeting Harvard, among other top programs in the country that were amenable to early high school graduates.\n\nHarvard turned out to be the perfect fit. Despite her youth, Aoki was able to integrate seamlessly. “Someone said to me in my dorm when we were moving in — we were just chatting — ‘I think someone in our year is, like, 16,’” she recalls, laughing. “Wow, a baby, wonder where they’re at. No one actually ever knows it’s me.”\n\nIn college, Aoki studied political science (known as government at Harvard) and classics, investigating everything from ancient Greek mythology to political systems and global revolutions. Bucking tradition, she entered the classics discipline with a nominal background in Latin and none in ancient Greek, building her Greek linguistic skills as a research assistant under her mentor. As a freshman, Aoki's diligence landed her her first published work in Classical Inquiries, Harvard’s rapid-publication project in the Center for Hellenic Studies: a piece of speculative fiction framed around the fabled story of Agammemnon at the Port of Aulis, a Greek king who led the army into the Trojan war.\n\nUnsurprisingly, her studies required that she become a near-permanent resident in the 24-hour library. “I think my longest library stretch was, like, five days,” she guesses. “[The security guard] was like, ‘Hey, bestie, this is the same shirt. I’ve gone home, I’ve seen my wife, I’ve had a shift change…. Go home.’”\n\nCollege was a unique experience for Aoki. Not only was she younger than her classmates and attending school in the middle of a pandemic that forced the campus to adjust to a remote model, but Harvard was in the midst of a high-profile Supreme Court case on affirmative action.\n\nAoki, who is of Japanese, Korean, and African American heritage, is very proud of all parts of her background. She remembers pulling up her application in class to showcase that she had marked “Asian” alongside “Black” under ethnicity. “We are correcting a wrong the country deliberately made,” she says in favor of affirmative action. “The one thing we know that creates more education is [parental] education. If your dad went to college, you’re probably going to go to college, and it continues to go. Black people — your grandfather just couldn’t go, it was the law.” For her, repairing that systemic damage is paramount.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action, barring schools from using race as a consideration for admission. “When a country cuts you off from what is a very, very clear path to being successful now, to education now,” Aoki says, “to be like, ‘Wow, we shouldn’t fix it’? It’s very simple to me.”\n\nShe had no explicit intention to return to the runway after starting at Harvard, aside from the odd family-related press activity. Previously, she had been scouted as a model while playing volleyball at Mamba Academy, but after she provided her contact information, the scout backed off. “She was like, ‘Never mind, so sorry. If your mom wanted you to model, you would be,'” she recounts.\n\nOn the Harvard campus, a new opportunity materialized via a recent alumnus who contacted her through the school database. “She reached out to me and I was like, ehh, not feeling it,” says Aoki. The scout countered by pitching her the idea of it being an efficient student job, commuting to New York from Cambridge every few weeks, while she continued to pursue her studies.\n\nJuggling academics and modeling was a delicate dance Aoki managed for years. She practiced her walk in the basement of her dorm, tweaking and refining control of her arms, powering through her stride. She pulled up to shows right at call time and did homework whenever she had downtime.\n\nAs a result, though, she rarely had time to just be a college student, often missing out on time with friends, romantic pursuits, and enjoying campus life. She was flying a million miles an hour, going from archaeological digs in the ancient Macedonian empire straight to shooting a campaign for Tommy Hilfiger in London.\n\nOccasionally, the breakneck pace caught up to her: After a week of study and a two-day whirlwind trip, she accidentally hit her head after falling in her hotel room. “As I was speed-packing in my hotel room, I turned around and… I basically knocked myself out,” Aoki says. “That’s when I knew it was a little bit crazy. I was in the car…. kind of like crying, watching [a bump on my head] develop and swell.”\n\nFrom a chance for Aoki to make some extra spending money, modeling evolved into a discipline she became emotionally invested in. She started booking shows like Sergio Hudson at New York Fashion Week and Pyer Moss’s couture show. But it was the Tommy Hilfiger 2022 Factory show that took her career to another level; she was on billboards across the country and participating in international shoots. Other brands began to take notice.\n\nSo, when school was winding down, she started to consider where she was having the most fun in her life. “I'm going to be a model,” she recalls telling her mom about her future plans. “We're not going to do — right now — grad school or law school. I'm not going to do politics or… all the other things floating around. I'm going to do this full-time for a bit.”\n\nHer mother was supportive, though protective and matter-of-fact about the gauntlet that is the modeling industry. “She’s just like, ‘I don’t want you to be exposed to judgment,’” she remembers. “I don’t know any mom who’d be like, ‘Yeah, go in there and have them measure your butt and tell you what they think.'”\n\nAoki is very close with her mother. They currently reside on opposite coasts, but they regularly chat for hours. When it comes to modeling, Kimora Lee, a mother of five, has encouraged her daughter to take the reins and pursue the craft seriously. Kimora Lee doesn’t cover any of Aoki's expenses for her modeling work — she pays allowances to her children as students, not models — and Aoki quickly had to learn to manage her finances, ensuring that she could afford her chosen career. For Kimora Lee, if her daughter couldn’t afford to fly herself out and find accommodations via her bookings, then she wasn’t a working model.\n\n“People think I’m getting top-secret information,” Aoki says with a laugh. “[They] think I can ask about my walk and she’ll have all this insight, and she’s like, ‘It’s a walk, you didn’t fall, it’s fine.’”\n\nAs the daughter of a prominent model and a titan in hip-hop history, Aoki is intimately aware that she is the quintessential “nepo baby” — she even made Vulture’s list of Top 20 nepo babies, alongside the Hadids and Jenners. And Aoki has seen other people who grew up in entertainment fumble their remarks in acknowledging the relatively comfortable position with which they entered the industry. “It’s totally true,\" she says. \"I had no idea if I’d do modeling without my family, without their name helping me. I sometimes think when I look at shows or shoots — if I had done it, and it was that bad, and I was not me, would I get another shot? Would I have had the chance to develop the way that I have?”\n\nMany of these advantages revolve around access, advice, and early exposure to the industry. Even if her mom is somewhat tight-lipped, most working models don’t have legendary runway coach Miss J giving last-minute tips as they practice their runway walk, or the mentorship of Tommy Hilfiger, who counseled Aoki to copyright her name early in her career. “All you can do is be grateful and try to stay in your lane a bit,” she says of the boost her family has given her.\n\nWhen race is involved, however, the benefits of nepotism aren't totally equal, Aoki notes. “What I have noticed, though, is that [nepotism] is not as much of a thing for models of color,” she says. On Vulture’s list of nepo baby models, she pointed out an apparent lack of people of color, which she says may indicate who benefits most from nepotism. “It was straight-up a white list. How is no one noticing that? I don’t think nepotism functions the exact same way when you aren’t white. [Nepotism] is still a huge thing, but maybe the kids of [people of color] don’t get the same excessive hype immediately.”\n\nAoki’s forthright nature shines brightest in her social media presence. In an era when every piece of your existence can be commodified for “content,” following preset templates to curate engagement, she shirks convention. Her TikTok lacks the varnish of a “creator” focused on preserving their brand, instead opting for a more unpolished and candid approach. “Get ready with me to go to the gym…. except, I’m ready, and we’re just gonna be drinking beverages,” she says in the opening seconds of a video where she tries to document the self-prescribed caffeine routine she uses to push her workouts further. But she runs into a series of hiccups, which one commenter called “chaotic in the best way.”\n\nThis non-curated approach has landed her in a few social media snafus, particularly as she navigates her relationship with celebrity. There was the time she got press attention for shooting her shot at Jack Harlow: “My friends and I were doing this thing where [you’re] posting your favorite artists and, I don’t know, [he] is so fine,” she recalls. She didn’t tag him, but the media coverage it garnered made its way to Harlow. “The one time I have a normal, little teenybopper opinion, it goes somewhere.”\n\nHer sharply phrased opinion on Darius Daulton’s public reproach of Keke Palmer after an appearance at Usher’s Las Vegas residence — remarks that were in accordance with wider public sentiment, it should be noted — made it to Entertainment Tonight. Aoki ended up messaging Palmer and apologizing, deleting her comments shortly after they were picked up. “She told me, ‘I’m fine,’” she says. “She was really sweet about it, like, ‘Speak your mind.’”\n\nThose brushes with the press are memorable, but one moment swept through social media like a tidal wave. After the family conspicuously omitted Russell Simmons from any public father’s day celebrations, both Aoki and her mother went on Instagram to detail the private turmoil they had been managing as a family. Aoki posted FaceTime calls and texts from her father in which they argue, according to the Los Angeles Times. One FaceTime, without audio, seems to show Russell yelling at her.\n\nAoki also posted a video of herself explaining how her relationship with her father had taken a toll on her mental health. “I don’t regret it,” she says about speaking out, still feeling it was good to have her say. “Part of it was already out there. There were reasons I thought it was reasonable to publish, because it was playing out in, like, a silent bubble.”\n\nSpeculation had already risen when Russell was not included in Aoki and Ming’s graduation celebrations on social media; prior to that, Russell had filed suit against ex-wife Kimora Lee, accusing her of fraudulently transferring 4 million shares of the energy drink Celsius to her accounts. The claim was dismissed, and Russell was ordered to pay Kimora Lee’s legal fees.\n\nFrom the public’s perspective, there was an apparent shift from the late 2010s to now: It seemed like the family had been, despite divorce, a largely cohesive unit, defending Russell amid numerous allegations against him, and had now become one in which he was on the outside looking in. Still, Aoki says, they’re a “normal family,” undergoing normal family strife.\n\nInternal drama is far from uncommon in families of any social position. The transition into young adulthood can come with brutal growing pains; after a life of your parents being on a pedestal, you begin to contend with their flaws. That form of heartbreak can be even more difficult to navigate when you are part of a dynastic family in Black entertainment, and the fissures are openly litigated in the court of public opinion, as opposed to the relative privacy of group chats and therapy sessions.\n\nSuddenly, Aoki was getting blowback from all angles. After she spoke out about her fractured relationship with her dad, she posted on Instagram about the misogynist responses she received. Then she put down her phone and went outside, soaking in the relative anonymity that the bustle of New York City affords. “If you don’t look at it, it’s not at all real,” she says of social media, laughing.\n\nShe also found comfort in knowing she was not alone in publicly dealing with family turmoil. Says Aoki, she recently ran into a celebrity who had experienced a similar family drama, who made her feel more at ease about speaking out, and the eventual outcome of her family relationships: “[That celebrity was] like, ‘Oh, I saw your thing. I did the same thing when I was, like, 20, and it was fine.’”\n\nAoki declines to comment on the numerous rape and sexual misconduct allegations made by others against her father, stressing a desire not to step out of place in consideration of all parties involved. (Russell Simmons has denied all allegations against him.)\n\nWithout question, family matters to Aoki more than anything. She is very close with her mom and siblings (she had to cut out early from a family trip to Tokyo to make this interview). Her sister, an influencer in her own right, is her go-to person for all styling and beauty tips; she effuses about her younger brother, Kenzo, who towers over her at six feet four and is part of an active AAU basketball program.\n\nIn her family, Aoki is also the one with the independent spirit. She’s the first to travel by herself, and broke the mold by moving out after college. Given that Aoki's youngest siblings are still in school, her mother had only been to two of her shows as her career was beginning. “No one kind of worries about me,” she says.\n\nHer interests extend beyond modeling — she has toyed with the idea of starting a YouTube channel and looked into everything from journalism to refugee work — but her current focus remains on her modeling craft. She is determined to discover methods to advance her skills, which can be a tall order in a highly subjective industry that doesn’t offer much feedback. She studies the walk of Karlie Kloss, whose frame resembles her own, is inspired by Jourdan Dunn’s famed ability to pump down the runway in any shoe, and practices walking in heels regularly. Alton Mason’s infusion of his dance background into his modeling has motivated her to revisit dance and yoga classes, bringing fluidity into her editorial work. “Just like you do for an exam,” she reflects. “What can I work on? For me, that was dance movement, getting more comfortable.”\n\nAoki is also adjusting to getting recognized a bit more, despite the fact that she still views herself as far from being a celebrity. What used to be a rare occurrence has escalated in intensity. But her elevated profile will not preclude her from using her voice to express herself when she feels compelled. Her opinionated nature requires she stay inquisitive, challenging existing conventions and expectations of what is possible and permissible.\n\nWith a microscope over her career, she is entertaining the idea of pursuing media training. “My feedback from my team is always like, ‘Shut up, give a shorter answer,’” she says, laughing. Ultimately, though, she’s grateful for the abundance of opportunities that exist before her. After a lifetime of having her existence adjudicated by the media, she is now transitioning into adulthood and taking her own story by the reins, on and off camera, with her family firmly by her side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“At the time, I was reading a lot of crazy stuff,” Aoki says, remembering how people said things like, “Poor her, she got the dad genes.” “There were literally articles like, ‘Celebrity Kid Gone Wrong’ — and I was like, ‘Okay, I’m 11.’” To this day, she remains perplexed by any observations of a supposed “glow up”; she merely went through the natural hormonal transformation that goes with adolescence.\n\n“Most people just don’t have [the public’s] opinions when they’re in high school,” she says. That level of surveillance is a para-social dynamic that she still works to manage. “If I said someone was talking about you… [or] 2000 people, how would you not check? Anyone would want to know.” Now she mitigates her intake of public speculation with proactive measures, such as refusing notifications and restricting who can tag her on Instagram.",

        "articleBody": "The tour's first trip to Cancun carried massive \"Well, that happened\" energy after questionable conditions and stormy weather dampened the finale's good vibes.\n\nIf you’re a sports entity preparing a showcase event featuring some of the best athletes in the world, two words should be left out of your planning:\n\n“Scramble mode.”\n\nThere’s potential for plenty of pratfalls while rushing to meet a deadline, a fact the Women’s Tennis Association could attest to after the conclusion of the season-ending championships in Cancun, Mexico. Selected as the venue less than two months before the tournament’s start, the race was on to get ready for the round-robin event, with the push including construction of a stadium court. By the final week of the season, the field was set, with the players making a return trip to Mexico after a lively tournament in Guadalajara in 2021.\n\nOptimism was high, but it seemed a vibe shift was imminent, perhaps starting with four-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek missing the memo on wearing white for the photo shoot.\n\nAfter her opening-round match on the first day, top seed Aryna Sabalenka let loose about the inconsistent playability of the tournament’s lone court, one that she barely had a chance to practice on.\n\nAnd aside from battling each other, the top eight’s most interminable opponent had to be Mother Nature. Rain and gale-force winds forced the players off the court with regularity, which also wreaked havoc on the scheduling. That, in turn, did a number on the attendance, especially during the day sessions.\n\nIt was a grueling test for singles and doubles players alike. Laura Siegemund and Vera Zvonareva—one of the top teams in the second half of the year—survived the gauntlet to win their first WTA Finals title together. On the singles side, a dream semifinal took shape with doubles partners Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula facing off on one side of the draw, while Sabalenka and Swiatek battled on the other. And, of course, it wouldn’t be the 2023 WTA Finals without weather playing a part.\n\nAt the end of the event, it was Swiatek who reigned (“rained”?) supreme, defeating Pegula in straight sets to claim her first WTA Finals title. She also returned to the top of the rankings post-tournament, making it an all-around successful tournament where the only thing that was predictable was unpredictability.",

        "articleBody": "Tune in all week for six famous Federer finals, from the 2005 US Open against Andre Agassi to 2009 Roland Garros versus Robin Soderling.\n\nIt’s the most wonderful time of year, and what is more wonderful than a Roger Federer match?\n\nThis week on Tennis Channel’s Plus Classics Channel, we’re winding the clock back to the finest Federer finals. Here are the six matches featured all week long:\nFederer vs. Robin Soderling, 2009 Roland Garros\n\nQuite a lot went on at this fateful French Open. Not only was rival Rafael Nadal knocked out in the Round of 16 by finalist Soderling, but at this point in his career, Federer had yet to win the clay slam. In an unforgettable three-set battle, Federer claimed his first and only Roland Garros title, making him the sixth player in history to have won every major.\n\nvs. Andy Roddick, 2009 Wimbledon\n\nThis final is one for the books against an in-form American in their third Wimbledon final. With an epic fifth-set score of 16-14, this four-hour, 17-minute match helped him pass Pete Sampras' Open Era total and put himself back on top of the tennis world.\nvs. Rafael Nadal, 2008 Wimbledon\n\nThe undisputed \"greatest match of all time\" between two of the greatest players in the history of the sport. Back in 2008, Federer and Nadal were ranked No. 1 and 2, respectively, and had faced each other in the previous two Wimbledon finals.\n\n“Each was trying to go against type and do something he hadn’t done before: Nadal to win Wimbledon, on the surface least hospitable to his game; Federer, the game’s great front-runner, to complete a stirring comeback in a Grand Slam final,” raved Steve Tignor.\n\nIf any tennis match was worthy of four hours and 48 minutes of a fan’s time, it’s this one. Including the two rain delays, this championship stretched over 7 hours.\n\nvs. Novak Djokovic, 2007 US Open\n\nThe fourth straight US Open title for the one and only Federer came against a championship victory against future world No. 1 Djokovic. In a tight three-set match, Federer became the first man since Bill Tilden in the 1920s to win the US Open slam four years in a row.\nvs. Andy Roddick, 2006 US Open\n\n“I was actually playing really well in the 2006 US Open final but all of a sudden after 15 minutes I was down a break and you just know he’s a downhill snowball,” said Roddick on his 2006 defeat.\n\nThat year, Federer was on a winning streak, riding a crisp 92-5 record through victories at the Australian Open, Wimbledon, the US Open and the ATP Finals. There was a reason he was world No. 1, and during this surge of greatness he produced some of the best tennis in his career.\n\nvs. Andre Agassi, 2005 US Open\n\nA year before his 2006 retirement, Agassi faced Federer in this classic fan-favorite battle at the 2005 US Open final. This four-set match was entertaining across the board, creating an unbelievable atmosphere for an elite level of tennis. This battle between beloved Agassi and cherished Federer lasted just over two hours with Agassi later admitting that Federer gave him no chance to win.\n\nThese six matches, along with many more classics, can be found on Tennis Channel all year long.",

        "title": "2023 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club Review by David Colman",
        "authors": "David Colman",
        "date": "2023-08-24",
        "articleBody": "The arrival of Mazda's latest Miata felicitously coincided with the warmest week of the year. This diminutive 2,484 pound sports car does a lot of things exceptionally well. It handles like a race car and scats like a motorcycle. But what it does best of all is provide a sense of driving euphoria unmatched by anything else on the road. Achieving that magic moment requires combining summer sunshine with a dropped top and with a curving road. When you've got all that going at one time, you're guaranteed a glimpse of driving nirvana.\n\nThankfully, Mazda designers have perfected the roof lowering operation to the simplest protocol imaginable. Reach up and clasp the fat roof release handle just north of the rearview mirror. Automatically, the side windows partially retract, allowing you to swing the lightweight roof backwards into its storage bin. Give it a final shove and the top clicks home, with its forward panel forming its own storage cover. This ingenious roof takes just five seconds to drop, requires no heavy electric motor, and proves equally facile to erect.\n\nThe convertible roof's design is emblematic of the Miata's basic but refined personality. When a sports car weighs as little as the MX-5, it doesn't require a gas-swilling V6, V8 or turbocharged power unit to provide invigorating performance. As it has from its inception more than 30 years ago, the Miata depends on just 4 normally aspirated cylinders for its motivation. When Mazda introduced the original MX-5, they fitted a 1.6 liter inline-4 which produced 116hp and 100lb.-ft. of torque. With a curb weight of just 2,189 pounds, that progenitor was saddled with a sluggish power-to-weight ratio of 18.87 lb/hp.\n\nThe 2023 MX-5 boasts a normally aspirated inline-4 displacing 2.0 liters, producing 181hp and 151lb.-ft of torque. Power-to-weight ratio thus surges to 12.95lb/hp. Not quite Corvette territory, but much closer than before. Proof of proficiency is certifiable: the latest MX-5 cranks a 0-60mph run in 5.7 seconds and a Standing Start 1/4 mile sprint of 14.5 seconds@95mph. The 1989 Miata took 8 seconds to reach 60mph and recorded a SS 1/4 mile time of 17 seconds@81mph. Now that's progress.\n\nMazda offers 5 different versions of the Miata this year, with the price leader Sport model starting at $29,215. The most expensive is the hardtop version designated Club RF going for $40,710. Our test Miata fell in the middle of the price range, with its base of $31,550 augmented by a $4,500 \"2BB\" package that upgraded brakes and suspension with Brembo disc brakes, BBS forged alloy wheels, and heated Recaro seats. If you're an enthusiast, you'll definitely want to pop for the 2BB package, which adds a great deal of lateral seat support, braking prowess, and wheel strength for a comparatively minimal investment. The dark rims are shod with sticky (TW 280) Bridgestone Potenza S001 rubber (205/45R17) which generate more than enough grip to keep you grinning. Mazda's Sport model also includes a few \"Appearance Package for Club\" styling tweaks to differentiate this Miata from more prosaic models: a front air dam (be careful of parking lot bumpers) and a rear lip spoiler. The 2BB kit also adds a pair of side sill extensions and a rear bumper skirt. All the spoilers and skirts are finished in gloss black to match the wheels, and the entire aero kit looks particularly attractive when paired with the optional $395 Snowflake White Pearl paint of our test car.\n\nAlthough you can select an optional 6-speed automatic transmission for your Miata, we would never do so unless faced with a daily commute that made manual shifting an untenable chore. That's because the standard 6-speed manual transmission in the MX-5 is simply the best stick shift you will find in any sports car today. With its precise gate differentiation, well weighted throw action, and predictable clutch action, the Club model is a joy to control. Add in laser-quick steering response, high grip level from those Potenzas, and terrific visibility in all directions (with the top dropped), and you've got yourself a recipe for driving kicks that's unparalleled at any price.

        "title": "5 Tips to Get the Compensation You Deserve After a Car Accident",
        "authors": "",
        "date": "2023-07-21",
        "articleBody": "Car accidents are an inevitable and traumatic reality of everyday life. Aside from the pain and suffering, there may also be significant financial losses suffered due to property damage or hospital bills associated with treatment. To ensure you are adequately compensated for any damages incurred in an automobile accident, we’ve compiled five essential tips to help ensure you get the compensation you deserve.\n\n    1. Seek Medical Attention and Keep Records\n\nImmediately seek medical attention, even if you do not feel any pain or injuries. Some car accident injuries, such as whiplash, soft tissue injuries, internal bleeding, and concussions, may not manifest immediately, and failure to seek timely treatment can aggravate your condition. Additionally, obtaining medical records, diagnosis, and treatment history is crucial when seeking compensation, as it strengthens your claim and proves the extent of your injuries. Follow any prescribed treatment plan and keep detailed records of all appointments, medication, treatments, bills, and receipts.\n\n    2. Document Everything\n\nBefore filing a claim, save copies of all relevant paperwork, such as repair estimates, medical bills, receipts for rental cars or alternative transportation costs, and other related documents. Take pictures of the accident scene and your damaged vehicle for further evidence. Additionally, keep track of all correspondences between yourself and insurance companies or attorneys to stay organized throughout the process. Any relevant evidence should be documented and saved for your records. If possible, you should try to obtain CCTV footage or any dash-camera footage that could help your case.\n\n    3. Hire an Experienced Attorney\n\nNavigating the legal system can be overwhelming, especially when trying to recover from your injuries and dealing with insurance companies. An experienced lawyer is familiar with the legal system and can investigate key details of your accident, such as obtaining relevant evidence, witness statements, medical records, and other relevant documents. Ensure your lawyer is specialized in car accident cases for the best possible outcome. Ask about their experience and success rate. Having a good lawyer on your side increases the chances of obtaining a fair settlement.\n\n    4. Be Careful with Insurance Adjusters\n\nInsurance adjusters are representatives of the insurance company and may try to downplay your injuries or losses or undermine your claim to reduce the compensation amount. If you face an insurance adjuster, answer any questions honestly and accurately but be careful not to make any statements that may be misconstrued or used against you later. Don’t give a recorded statement to the adjusters before consulting with your lawyer. Also, avoid signing any documents without carefully reading and understanding them. Your lawyer can advise you on what is fair and support you when negotiating with insurance companies.\n\n    5. File Your Claim Quickly\n\nMost states have a set time limit or “statute of limitations” to file a personal injury claim, usually from the day of the accident to three years. To avoid missing crucial deadlines, file your claim as early as possible. Additionally, filing promptly can help preserve relevant evidence and ensure accuracy in reporting details. It also gives your lawyer ample time to investigate and build a strong case on your behalf. Take all necessary steps quickly before any memories fade and documents are misplaced.\n\n    Endnote\n\nCar accidents are often stressful, challenging, and financially burdensome. Seeking compensation can help ease these burdens. Following the above five tips can put you on the right path to receiving the compensation you deserve. Remember, to ensure you get fair compensation. It is best to seek the counsel of experienced car accident attorneys.",

        "title": "The Role of Kinks in Relationships: How to Communicate Your Desires",
        "authors": "Lana Vrzic",
        "date": "2023-12-19",
        "articleBody": "Intimacy and desire are intricate components of any romantic relationship. They evolve, adapt, and deepen over time, reflecting the unique connection between two individuals. As couples navigate their journey together, it’s not uncommon for them to discover certain sexual preferences or “kinks” that add a layer of excitement and fulfillment to their intimate moments.\n\nHowever, discussing these desires can be a delicate matter, often surrounded by stigma or fear of judgment. In this article, we will explore the role of kinks in relationships, the importance of open communication, and how to approach these conversations with your partner.\n\nUnderstanding Kinks: What Are They?\n\nBefore diving into the discussion of communicating desires, it’s essential to clarify what the kinks are. Kinks, in the context of relationships and sexuality, refer to unconventional sexual preferences or fantasies that deviate from the mainstream or traditional practices.\n\nThese preferences can encompass a wide range of activities, such as BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, masochism), role-playing, fetishism, and more. It’s important to recognize that kinks are a normal aspect of human sexuality and can add excitement and novelty to a relationship.\nThe Role of Kinks in Relationships\n\nEnhanced Intimacy: Exploring kinks can deepen the level of intimacy between partners. Engaging in shared fantasies or desires creates a unique bond, as it requires vulnerability and trust.\n\nSpice and Excitement: Kinks can inject excitement and variety into a long-term relationship. They provide an opportunity to break routine and explore new facets of each other’s desires.\n\nEmotional Connection: For many couples, kinks are a way to enhance emotional connection. The act of sharing fantasies and desires can foster a sense of emotional closeness and openness.\n\nImproved Communication: Discussing kinks necessitates open and honest communication. This improved communication can extend beyond the bedroom and positively impact other relationships.\n\nMutual Exploration: Partners can learn more about each other’s boundaries, desires, and comfort zones through exploring kinks together. This mutual exploration can lead to a more fulfilling sex life.\n\nWhy Open Communication Matters\n\nWhile kinks can bring richness to a relationship, effective communication is crucial when introducing them into the partnership. Here’s why open communication is essential:\n\nTrust and Understanding: Discussing your desires with your partner demonstrates trust and understanding. It allows you both to better grasp each other’s needs and limits.\n\nConsent and Boundaries: Consent is paramount in any sexual activity. Clear communication ensures that both partners are comfortable with the proposed activities and establishes boundaries to avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nConflict Resolution: Open communication facilitates conflict resolution. If disagreements arise regarding kinks or preferences, discussing them openly can lead to compromises that satisfy both partners.\n\nMutual Exploration: Talking about kinks paves the way for mutual exploration. It encourages both partners to be active participants in creating a fulfilling and exciting sex life.\nHow to Communicate Your Desires\n\nSelf-Reflection: Before discussing your desires with your partner, take time for self-reflection. Understand what specific kinks or fantasies you want to explore and why they appeal to you. This self-awareness will help you communicate your desires more clearly.\n\nChoose the Right Time and Place: Finding the appropriate setting to discuss kinks is essential. Pick a time when both you and your partner are relaxed and have the privacy to engage in an open conversation without distractions.\n\nStart Slowly: If you’re unsure about your partner’s reaction, start the conversation slowly. Begin by expressing your appreciation for your relationship and emphasizing your desire to enhance your connection.\n\nUse “I” Statements: When discussing your desires, use “I” statements to express your feelings and needs without placing blame. For example, say, “I have been thinking about exploring this fantasy,” rather than, “You should do this.”\n\nListen Actively: Encourage your partner to share their thoughts and feelings about your desires. Actively listen without interrupting, and be open to their perspective.\n\nBe Respectful: Respect your partner’s boundaries and feelings. Understand that they may need time to process your desires or may not share the same interests. It’s essential to accept their positive or negative response without judgment.\n\nEducate Together: If you and your partner are open to exploring a new kink, consider educating yourselves. Read books and articles, or watch videos related to the topic to ensure you have a shared understanding and can practice safely.\n\nSeek Guidance: If you encounter challenges discussing or exploring kinks, consider seeking guidance from a qualified therapist or counselor. They can provide professional support to address any issues that may arise.\n\nSafety and Consent in Kink Exploration\n\nExploring kinks should always prioritize safety and consent. It’s crucial to establish clear boundaries, use safe words, and ensure both partners are fully comfortable with any activities. Safety extends beyond physical aspects, encompassing emotional well-being. Open communication is key to reaffirming consent throughout the experience and addressing any concerns promptly. Prioritizing safety and consent helps create a trusting and respectful environment for kink exploration.\nNavigating Varied Comfort Levels in a Relationship\n\nIn relationships, it’s common for partners to have varying levels of comfort with certain kinks or fantasies. Respect and understanding are vital when these differences arise. Couples can navigate this by engaging in open, non-judgmental conversations, acknowledging each other’s boundaries, and finding compromises that honor both partners’ feelings and desires. It’s essential to maintain trust and prioritize the emotional connection while exploring kinks together.\nNon-Verbal Communication and Body Language\n\nEffective communication in kink exploration goes beyond words. Paying close attention to non-verbal cues and body language is crucial for understanding a partner’s comfort and enthusiasm. Partners should be attuned to each other’s physical and emotional responses during kink-related activities. Establishing trust and clear communication about interpreting non-verbal signals can enhance the overall experience and ensure that both partners feel safe, respected, and fulfilled in their kink exploration.\n\nConclusion\n\nKinks can play a significant role in enhancing intimacy and excitement within a romantic relationship. However, discussing these desires with your partner requires open communication, trust, and understanding. Remember that kinks are a natural aspect of human sexuality, and sharing them can lead to a deeper emotional connection.\n\nApproach the conversation with care, self-awareness, and a willingness to listen and respect your partner’s feelings and boundaries. Ultimately, open communication can lead to a more fulfilling and exciting sex life for both partners.

        "title": "Mental Health and Support Services on Backpage Alternatives: Seeking Help Online",
        "authors": "Lana Vrzic",
        "date": "2023-12-18",
        "articleBody": "In today’s digital age, the internet has become a powerful tool for information and entertainment and seeking mental health support.\n\nBackpage alternatives, which have gained popularity for various services, can also be a valuable resource for individuals needing assistance and guidance for their mental well-being. In this article, we will explore the availability of mental health and support services on these platforms, emphasizing the importance of seeking help online when facing emotional challenges.\n\nThe Online Mental Health Landscape\n\nThe internet has transformed the way people access mental health services. Backpage alternatives, often associated with various listings, can provide a platform for mental health professionals, support groups, and individuals to connect and offer assistance. Many licensed therapists and counselors have recognized the potential of these platforms to reach a broader audience and offer their expertise in a virtual setting.\n\nOne advantage of seeking mental health support online is the convenience it offers. Individuals can access therapy sessions, support groups, or counseling from the comfort of their own homes. This accessibility can be especially beneficial for those with mobility issues or live in remote areas with limited access to in-person mental health services.\n\nMoreover, online mental health services on Backpage alternatives often come with reduced costs compared to traditional in-person therapy. This affordability can make therapy more accessible to a wider range of people who may not have the financial means to seek professional help otherwise.\n\nPrivacy and Confidentiality in Online Mental Health Support\n\nPrivacy and confidentiality are paramount in the world of mental health support, whether it’s provided in person or online. When seeking help for personal or emotional issues, individuals often want to ensure that their information remains secure and their identities are protected. This concern is equally relevant when exploring mental health support on Backpage alternatives and similar online platforms.\n\nOnline mental health services must prioritize privacy to build trust and encourage individuals to seek help. Most reputable therapists and counselors on these platforms adhere to strict confidentiality standards. They use encrypted communication channels and secure platforms to conduct sessions, ensuring that personal information remains confidential.\n\nHowever, individuals seeking online mental health support should also take proactive steps to protect their privacy. This includes using secure and private internet connections, being cautious about sharing personal information, and verifying the credentials of the professionals they engage with. By practicing these measures, individuals can enjoy the benefits of online mental health support while safeguarding their privacy.\n\nThe Role of Peer Support in Online Mental Health Communities\n\nOnline mental health communities on Backpage alternatives and similar platforms often extend beyond professional therapy or counseling. Peer support is vital in these communities, providing individuals a sense of belonging and understanding. Peer support involves individuals with shared experiences coming together to offer each other encouragement, empathy, and guidance.\n\nParticipating in peer support groups can be a valuable complement to formal therapy. It allows individuals to connect with others who have faced similar challenges and can offer practical advice and emotional support. Peer support groups can especially benefit those with specific mental health conditions, addiction recovery, or difficult life transitions.\n\nOne of the strengths of online mental health communities is the diversity of peer support groups available. Whether someone is struggling with depression, anxiety, addiction, or a unique life situation, they can often find a group of peers who can relate to their experiences and provide insight and encouragement.\n\nNavigating the Online Mental Health Landscape\n\nWhile online mental health support on platforms like Backpage alternatives offers many advantages, navigating this landscape with awareness and discernment is essential. Not all sources of support may be trustworthy or effective, and individuals should exercise caution when choosing their mental health resources.\n\nFirst and foremost, individuals should verify the credentials and qualifications of professionals offering online therapy or counseling. Licensed therapists and counselors should have relevant qualifications and experience in the field of mental health. Additionally, individuals should research the platform itself to ensure it adheres to security and privacy standards.\n\nMoreover, individuals should recognize that online mental health support is not a replacement for emergency services. If someone is in crisis, experiencing severe distress, or has thoughts of self-harm or harm to others, it’s crucial to seek immediate help from a crisis hotline, a local mental health provider, or a hospital.\n\nIn conclusion, online mental health support offers diverse resources and opportunities for individuals seeking help and guidance. Privacy and confidentiality are fundamental in this digital landscape; peer support can provide a sense of community and understanding. Navigating the online mental health landscape requires vigilance and research to ensure individuals receive safe and effective support for their well-being.\n\nTypes of Online Mental Health Services\n\nThe range of mental health services available on Backpage alternatives is diverse. Individuals seeking support can find licensed therapists and counselors who offer virtual sessions through video calls or text-based chat. These sessions can address various mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, relationship issues, etc.\n\nSupport groups are another valuable resource available online. These groups bring together individuals facing similar challenges, providing a safe space for sharing experiences and coping strategies. Support groups can offer a sense of community and understanding, whether dealing with addiction, grief, or specific mental health conditions.\n\nThe Importance of Seeking Help Online\n\nSeeking help online through Backpage alternatives for mental health support can be a lifeline for many individuals. It breaks down barriers to access and offers a more flexible and affordable way to receive assistance. However, it’s essential to approach these services cautiously and ensure that the individuals providing support are qualified and reputable.\n\nIn conclusion, the internet has opened up new avenues for accessing mental health and support services, even on platforms like Backpage alternatives. Seeking help online can be a practical and effective way to address mental health challenges.\n\nRemember that you don’t have to face these challenges alone; a supportive online community is ready to help. If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health issues, go over here to explore the resources available on these platforms, and don’t hesitate to reach out for support. Your mental well-being matters and help is just a click away.",

        "authors": "Marsha Lederman",
        "date": "2023-12-23",
        "articleBody": "Dear Friends,\n\nIt’s that time of year for our annual family Christmas letter – composed without the help of ChatGPT, we promise! We know that when you clicked on this, you might have thought it was yet another one of those open letters asking you to add your name in support of an urgent cause. But we’re going to try to focus on happy thoughts in this season of joy. (Emphasis on “try;” 2023 has been a tough one.)\n\nWe want to let you know what our family, the Canadians, has been up to over this eventful year!\n\nAccomplishments:\n\nNot the Eglinton light rail line, amirite? Or fixing the housing crisis, the homelessness crisis, the affordability crisis, the health care crisis, or the toxic drug crisis.\n\nBut, hey, the pandemic finally ended! (Even if a bunch of us Canadians are really, really sick right now.)\n\nWe were so excited when the family basketball team almost made it to the playoffs. (There’s always 2024, Raptors!) And when our baseball team scored that one run in their wild card series! (The series that the other team swept. Sigh. There’s always 2024, Blue Jays!) In hockey, the whole family was rallying around the kids in Edmonton for a while, but that too came to a crashing halt.\n\nEnding our accomplishments section on a positive note, a member of the family won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay. (Yay, Sarah!) Another family member contributed to Hollywood’s Barbenheimer sensation. Wasn’t Ryan – the pride of the London, Ont., wing of the family – a doll as Ken? Margaret did not win the Nobel Prize for Literature, but she did get a pacemaker and she performed a little dance at the hospital to show us how well she is doing, and frankly we’ll take a working, noble heart over a Nobel any day.\n\nVisitors:\n\nIt’s been a big year for guests. First, we welcomed a very special invitee over to the House, even gave him a standing ovation, but then things went a little awry afterward. Turns out Yaroslav was not exactly the war hero as advertised. If only someone had spent as much time vetting that invitation as someone probably spent vetting a tweet (now called an “X”?) inviting the Taylor Swift to Canada. But guess what: it worked! She’s coming! To Toronto and Vancouver next year!\n\nBig props to Justin, the head of our Swiftie household, for extending the invitation.\n\nYes, we know Justin is not the official family ruler. That’s Charles, and this was a big year for him too, as he was officially coronated (we think that’s the term) and has now made his way onto our money (instead of just spending it LOL). We probably would have been a lot more excited about Charles’s ascension had we not read about his dearth of parenting skills in Spare or watched him devastate Diana in The Crown.\n\nFamily Updates:\n\nThis part of our Christmas letter is a little sensitive as there have been some big changes to parts of the Canadian family in 2023. As you probably heard, it hasn’t been a great year on the marital front, and there have also been some related job changes. (Although, sticking to our theme of attempted positivity, John T’s demise in Toronto was ultimately good news for Olivia.) Of course, the biggest news on this front was Justin and Sophie calling it quits. We are a little bit heartbroken and wish them – and any other members of the family going through this – well this holiday season. We know it’s not easy.\n\nActivities:\n\nWe experienced a lot of hikes this year as a family! Not the fun outdoor kind that require boots; the other kind that have some people saying we should give Justin the boot. LOL. Even though it’s not really his fault. Double LOL. We managed not one, not two, but three interest rate hikes in a single year! While this did not quite match the level of hikes we Canadians experienced in 2022, it was a really dominant theme around our dinner table this year!\n\nIn related news, we’ve decided to forgo the turkey for Christmas dinner and feast instead on mashed potatoes and possibly brussels sprouts (TBD). We might also be able to swing some Stove Top stuffing if it goes on sale early enough. We’re all doing our part to get through the holidays solvent!\n\nBy the way, we’re writing this letter while wrapping gifts we bought at the mall in a big, big rush last weekend, because we were worried someone might discover that we are 1.2 per cent Jewish. But we managed!\n\nHappy holidays to all the members of our family, the Canadians. And let’s hope for better news in 2024.",

        "authors": "Annalisa Barbieri",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "I have had little contact with either of my siblings, particularly my brother Jon, who is quite controlling and bullied me when I was a child. But after my mother’s death a few months ago (my father died many years earlier), I am having to deal with them, because we are all executors of my mother’s estate.\n\nJon managed my mother’s finances for the last few years of her life and my sister and I independently suspected him of financial abuse. We have recently learned that Jon was managing my mother’s finances via a joint account, so legally Mum’s savings belong to him. There was no lasting power of attorney. My mum needed care and we suspect he fraudulently concealed her savings from the council by moving a large sum to his own account in order to gain free care for our mum.\n\nMy mum’s will is held at a solicitors and Jon is reluctant to apply for probate, insisting that Mum’s house be put up for sale first. In a recent email he told us that the money that had been in my mum’s bank accounts wouldn’t be included in the probate application but that he might be willing to privately distribute it to us once estate administration has finished. We think this is to try to cover up the fraud relating to the care assessment. Jon is trying to hold us to ransom and this has brought back awful memories from my childhood.\n\nWe don’t know what to do and worry that going to a solicitor for advice would cost too much.\n\nI’m sorry about your situation and my condolences.\n\nI went to Gary Rycroft, senior partner at Joseph A Jones & Co and a specialist in wills, to help with this. What your brother Jon is saying is factually incorrect in quite a few areas.\n\nJust because your brother has a joint account with your mum does not make the money his. The bank may have put it in his name if he’s told them your mum has died, but if the money was all from your mum, it is all part of her estate. “He may be the surviving account holder,” says Rycroft, “but that’s different from being the beneficial owner, so in a sense he’s a trustee of that money and holding it in trust for the estate.”\n\nHe cannot sell your mum’s house without probate – this is the law – so this is your first port of call. I understand that you are nervous of legal fees but if it hasn’t been done already then you should write to the solicitor holding the will and explain that your mother has died, that you are one of three executors and this solicitor should handle everything. The solicitor will ask for various things including assets, savings, bank account details and you will need to get valuations for the house.\n\nYou don’t have to use the solicitor holding the will but the point is that any fees for dealing with probate and your mum’s estate come out of the estate, which means that it will also impact on Jon. You don’t shoulder these costs alone.\n\nOnce the Department for Work and Pensions knows your mum has died it may also look into any benefits paid (are they still being paid?). So no wonder Jon doesn’t want to apply for probate because this is where everything will come out in the wash.\n\nAs Rycroft says, you don’t have to deal with Jon at all if you don’t want – the solicitor can do that. If Jon doesn’t agree, he can then instruct his own solicitor at his own cost to represent him.\n\nRycroft also points out that “not providing full disclosure is unlawful”. If Jon asks you to do anything you are unhappy about, use this line and explain that you do not wish to get a criminal record.\nskip past newsletter promotion.",

        "authors": "Joanna Walters, Edward Helmore",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Recording shows Trump asked canvassers not to sign official document confirming Biden had won, Detroit News says\n\nDonald Trump made a phone call in November 2020 in which he put pressure on two Republican election officers in Michigan not to sign the official document from the state confirming that Joe Biden had won the presidential election there, according to an exclusive report by The Detroit News late on Thursday.\n\nThe Detroit News outlet has obtained recordings of the call, made on 17 November 2020, where Trump, who was refusing to accept that he had just lost the White House to Joe Biden, and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel talked to Wayne county election officials Monica Palmer and William Hartmann and told them they would look “terrible” if they signed to endorse Trump’s defeat in the crucial swing state, according to the report.\n\nPalmer and Harmann were members of the Wayne county board of canvassers, one of the state’s official county teams – each with two Democrats and two Republicans – appointed by state election commissioners for duties such as inspecting ballots and certifying elections for all local, countywide and district offices.\n\nTrump told them on the phone call obtained and reported by the Detroit News that: “We’ve got to fight for our country. We can’t let these people take our country away from us.”\n\nMcDaniel is from Michigan and was also reportedly on the call and told the two board members: “If you can go home tonight, do not sign it,” adding “We will get you attorneys.”\n\nTrump then added: “We’ll take care of that.”\n\nThe newspaper further reported that representatives of Palmer, McDaniel and Trump, contacted by the reporter in question through spokespeople, did not dispute a summary of the call that was shared with them. The News said Hartmann died in 2021.\n\nOn Thursday Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung issued a statement saying that Trump’s call was “taken in furtherance of his duty as president of the United States to faithfully take care of the laws and ensure election integrity, including investigating the rigged and stolen 2020 presidential election”.\n\nThe call and then Palmer and Harmann’s refusal to add their signatures to Wayne county’s official certification of Biden’s victory at the ballot box was apparently designed to sow doubt about the accuracy of the result.\n\nPalmer and Hartmann’s refusal to sign the certification and a failed attempt to withdraw their votes from the day before in which they confirmed Biden’s victory in the county did not impede Biden’s win in Michigan. That was a crucial piece of his 2020 victory on behalf of the Democratic party, with he and now-US vice president Kamala Harris beating Republicans Trump and his Vice-President Mike Pence’s bid for re-election.\n\nThe report of the phone call has strong echoes of the call Trump made on 2 January 2021, in which he pressed the secretary of state in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in that state, too. News of the phone call emerged almost immediately.\n\nThe pressure on Raffensperger is part of the criminal case against Trump and multiple co-defendants in Georgia, accusing them in a racketeering case of an election interference conspiracy.\n\nThe Wayne county tapes in Michigan are understood not to be part at this time of the federal election interference case against Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith on behalf of the US Department of Justice.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump’s niece, Mary, an outspoken critic of the former president, wrote on Substack that the Wayne county audio recording could bolster the federal investigation by special counsel Jack Smith into Trump’s alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election results.\n\n“Why is this so bad for Donald? The recordings are proof of his direct involvement in pressuring election officials to undermine certification,” Mary Trump wrote. “We all heard Donald’s Georgia call, but this is a shocking development. The fact that Donald appears to be personally involved in pressuring officials down to the level of county canvassers shows the lengths he went to subvert the election.”\n\nMichigan officials are still investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat in the state in 2020, after 16 people were criminally charged earlier this year in relation to signing paperwork falsely asserting that Trump had won the state in 2020. The primary season for the 2024 presidential election begins in January and Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination as he seeks re-election despite facing dozens of indictments in four criminal cases – two federal cases, in which the US supreme court has now become involved, as well as one in New York and the one in Georgia.",

        "articleBody": "The writer Paul Wells has some rules of Canadian politics, and the very first one says, \"For any given situation, Canadian politics will tend toward the least exciting possible outcome.\" The experience of former mayors Rob Ford and Mel Lastman, among other things, has long made it obvious that Toronto politics follows a different set of rules.\n\nAnd 2023 demonstrated again that whatever adjectives you'd apply to our local government, \"least exciting\" isn't among them.\n\nIn fact, the corresponding rule for Toronto politics might be more in line with something from Yogi Berra: \"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\" I mean honestly, looking a back to when 2023 began, I don't think anyone predicted this. How could we?\n\nConsider: John Tory — whose name could be listed in the thesaurus as a synonym for \"least exciting\" — had just been elected by a landslide to a third term that could have made him the longest-serving mayor in Toronto history. The big controversy was about the \"strong mayor\" powers that meant he'd have a stranglehold on local politics for the foreseeable future. It just turned out that the amount of future that turned out to be foreseeable was exceedingly short. \n\nDid anyone predict a John Tory sex scand — ahem, uh — John Tory \"inappropriate relationship\" scandal? Or that at the first suggestion of scandal he'd resign within hours and walk away? \n\nConsider too, that when the year began Olivia Chow was retired from politics, teaching at Toronto Metropolitan University. She'd placed third in a run for mayor way back in 2014 and then lost a riding-level election for federal Parliament. She seemed a completely spent political force. \n\nEven when Chow announced her entry into the mayoral race, many of us expected she'd suffer the same fate as in 2014, an early name-recognition front-runner who faded during the campaign.\n\nPundits predict, fate laughs.\n\nAnd so did Olivia, who rode a kind of \"Good Vibes Only\" campaign into office in a city where bad vibes seemed more to capture the zeitgeist. (Chalk one point up for Wells, whose third rule is \"the candidate in the best mood wins.\")\n\nThen the immediate questions were about how or if she'd be able to lead the same city council John Tory had commanded, which lasted until Tory's deputy mayor Jennifer McKelvie switched from campaigning against Chow to being a core part of her team, alongside former Tory allies like Paul Ainslie, and even people like Jon Burnside (who had begged political mentor Tory not to resign) offered early assessments that Chow was \"hitting it out of the park.\" Turned out winning power helps make a lot of friends. \n\nWhich leads us to also consider that back in January 2023, a theme and pressing problem was Premier Doug Ford just absolutely bullying our city into submission, laughing at Tory's requests for more cash (and even taking some away), ramming Greenbelt changes down everyone's throat, imposing strong mayor powers that ultimately left Ford as the Superstrong Ubermayor, rushing through a demolition job on Ontario Place, and more. \n\nEven during the election campaign, one of the widespread predictions about Chow as a potential mayor was that she'd inevitably wind up as a sparring partner (and punching bag) for Boss Hogtown over at Queen's Park. \n\nNow, Ontario Place is still on the spa track today. But I'm not sure how many of us predicted the relentless fall of Ford as a political force, and the relentless series of reversals he made of policies he'd dug in. Or his attempt at a \"face turn\" — to borrow professional wrestling lingo — to become a pal and tag team partner to Mayor Chow, which culminated in uploading the Gardiner and DVP to the province's books (as Tory had once requested in vain) and raining money on the city. \n\nNow, not everything was surprising. When the year started, we had no idea when the Eglinton Crosstown would open. As the year ends, we have no idea when the Eglinton Crosstown will open. Predictably, the attempt to wrangle the roaring success of CaféTO patios into permanent rules just about killed the initiative. Predictably, the attempt to make drinking alcohol in parks legal treated a normal activity like an illicit dirty secret. Predictably, traffic congestion got even worse (which didn't seem possible, though it turns out worsening traffic is not only always possible in Toronto, but likely). \n\nEven in a year defined by the unexpected, there are some lasting truths. \n\nSo where does all this leave us looking ahead to 2024? Well, it certainly feels like maybe there's a sliver more optimism at city hall, with a mayor who believes doing things differently is possible and has shown some early ability to make friends and inch towards her goals. But it also feels like maybe Chow's smooth-sailing ship is likely to enter choppier waters, especially as even some expected allies are grumbling about her leadership on recent decisions about Yonge-Dundas Square, Rob Ford Stadium and the fine print of the \"new deal\" with Ford. The flurry of good-news funding headlines to end the year notwithstanding, the budget process in the weeks ahead is going to feature painful service cuts or painful tax increases or both.\n\n(If you're interested in Chow's own reflections on 2023, and lookahead to 2024, she visited me in the Star podcast studio for an episode of This Matters posted Friday.)\n\nMaybe 2023 showed that it's foolish to try to read the tea leaves, because their appearance just means your cup is empty — they are remnants of what you already had to drink, not an indicator of what's being poured for you next. About 70 years ago, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan explained the biggest challenge for political leaders, and the biggest obstacle to political fortune tellers too: \"events, dear boy, events.\" \n\n2023 was an eventful year. My prediction for 2024? Events, dear reader. Events.",

(AP) — It was the dog, stuck atop skyscraping grain silos on Springfield's northeast side in 2019, that forced Chris Richmond's hand.\n\nThe stray had found its way to the top of the behemoth Pillsbury Mills, for decades a flour-churning engine of the central Illinois city's economy but now vacant more than 20 years. Rescue was too risky amid such decay, officials said.\n\nThe brief but precarious appearance by the dog, found dead at ground level days later after ingesting rat poison, represented the hopelessness posed by the vacant campus, Richmond recalled.\n\n“That's when I said, ‘This is just unacceptable in our community,'\" said the 54-year-old retired city fire marshal, whose father's Pillsbury paycheck made him and his brother first-generation college graduates.\n\nA year later, Richmond and allies emerged with a nonprofit called Moving Pillsbury Forward and a five-year, $10 million plan to raze the century-old plant and renew the 18-acre (7.3-hectare) site.\n\nRichmond, the group's president and treasurer, vice president Polly Poskin and secretary Tony DelGiorno have $6 million in commitments and targets for collecting the balance.\n\nHaving already razed two structures, the group expects the wrecking ball to swing even more feverishly next year. Next door to a railyard with nationwide connections, they envision a light industrial future.\n\nMeanwhile, Moving Pillsbury Forward has managed to turn the decrepit site in Illinois’ capital city into a leisure destination verging on cultural phenomenon.\n\nTours have been highly popular and repeated. Oral histories have emerged. Spray-paint vandals, boosted instead of busted, have become artists in residence for nighttime graffiti exhibitions, which more than 1,000 people attended.\n\nRetired University of Illinois archeologist Robert Mazrim has mined artifacts and assembled an “Echoes of Pillsbury” museum beneath a leaking loading dock roof. This month, the plant's towering headhouse is ablaze with holiday lights.\n\nPerhaps the exuberance with which Moving Pillsbury Forward approaches its task sets it apart. But in terms of activist groups pursuing such formidable reclamation aspirations, it’s not unusual, said David Holmes, a Wisconsin-based environmental scientist and brownfields redevelopment consultant.\n\nGovernment funding has expanded to accommodate them.\n\n“You find some high-caliber organizations that are really focused on the areas with the biggest problems, these most-in-need neighborhoods,” Holmes said. “A lot of times, cities (local governments) are focused on their downtowns or whatever gets the mayor the ribbon cutting.”\n\nMinneapolis-based Pillsbury built the Springfield campus in 1929 and expanded it several times through the 1950s. A bakery mix division after World War II turned out the world's first boxed cake mixes.\n\nThere is circumstantial evidence that the Pillsbury doughboy, the brand's seminal mascot, was first drawn by a Springfield plant manager who eschewed credit, not, as the company maintains, in a Chicago ad agency.\n\nPillsbury sold the plant in 1991 to Cargill, which departed a decade later. A scrap dealer ran afoul of the law with improper asbestos disposal in 2015, prompting a $3 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup. After the dog's cameo, Moving Pillsbury Forward persuaded the EPA to drop a lien for its cleanup costs and purchased the property for $1.\n\nNow, all that’s left is to sweep up a the remaining asbestos and lead paint chips before pulling down more than 500,000 square feet (46,450 square meters) of factory, including a 242-foot (73.8-meter) headhouse that’s the city’s third-tallest structure and 160 silos, four abreast and standing 100 feet (30.5 meters).\n\n“It’s daunting. Everything about this place is daunting,” Richmond concedes. “But a journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step, right?”\n\nThe timing is right. There is more money than ever available to mop up America's left-behinds, according to Holmes.\n\nThe 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included $1.2 billion for brownfields cleanup, four times the typical annual allotment The Pillsbury group wants $2.6 million of the total added to what the group already has been promised by the federal, state and Springfield governments.\n\nThe application plays up the intangible benefits: economic and environmental justice availing the 12,000 people who live within 1 mile (1.61 kilometers) of the plant, only 25% of whom have a high school diploma and whose median household income is $25,000.\n\n“It's a tough sell but at some point, there are enough people who have a vision for what it could be that that's a powerful incentive,” Poskin said. “It isn't going to be anything until what's there is gone. No developer is going to take on a $10 million cleanup job.”\n\nThe group also set out to preserve memories of the place they are working to tear down. Ex-workers and neighbors have clamored for spots in ongoing tours and posed for group photos.\n\nIn a historical seniority list on display, next to “Jackson, Ernest, 1937,” is the message, “Hi Grandpa. We are visiting your workplace of 42 yrs.” Richmond and Mazrim have collected more than a dozen oral histories from past employees. Photographers are documenting what remains for historical context.\n\nAnd it's become an unlikely canvas. Minneapolis-based graffiti artists who tag their work “Shock” and “Static” were surreptitiously decorating the place in September when Richmond and Mazrim confronted them. Instead of pressing a trespassing charge, Richmond invited them to stage an exhibition. The nighttime November showing proved so popular that Richmond added a second date.\n\nArtist Eric Rieger, known to fans as HOTTEA, also took part, creating in a “cathedral-like” setting a huge, rectangular grid of black-light-lit neon strings of yarn suspended from the ceiling. His goal was “a sense of really positive energy” reminiscent of the fond memories employees experienced.\n\n“They were so enthusiastic and that’s rare to find nowadays,\" Rieger said the night of the first exhibit Nov. 9. \"I really respect what they did for this community because they're the backbone of America — they were feeding America.”",

        "articleBody": "From Subway to 7-Eleven to the UPS Store to RE/MAX, franchised businesses are all around us, even though we may not always realize it. Many businesses that are commonly thought of as national chains are actually independently owned franchises, and for aspiring entrepreneurs, these brands represent the opportunity to own and operate a market-tested business in their own backyard.\n\nOpening a franchise appeals to many entrepreneurs, even those who plan to one day build their own business from scratch. By starting with a franchise, a first-time business owner can learn how a successful, well-branded business operates from the inside out and later integrate these insights into the development of their own company.\n\nWhat is a franchise? Definition and explanation\n\nIn a technical sense, a franchise is a contractual agreement between the owner of a brand (a franchisor) and a business operator (a franchisee) that allows the business operator to own and run a branch of the franchisor’s business using the brand’s unique identity, logo, reputation, marketing materials, and proprietary business model to sell the brand’s products and services to consumers.\n\nIn other words, a franchise is a mutually beneficial joint business venture through which a brand empowers an entrepreneur to own and operate a branch of that brand’s business in exchange for a startup fee and a percentage of the branch’s revenue.\n\nConversationally speaking, however, the word franchise is used most often among the public to describe either a franchised business at large (e.g., Wendy’s the brand) or any given location of a franchised business (e.g., your local Wendy’s restaurant).\n\nEach location of a franchised business is essentially an independently operated outlet that benefits from the brand recognition, marketing efforts, and established operational model of the franchisor.\nFranchisor vs. Franchisee: What’s the difference?\n\nA franchisor is the owner of an established, successful original business with some degree of brand recognition. This could be a relatively small, regional business run by a single proprietor (like a roofing company with 12 branches around the Midwest), or a well-known, multinational brand with tens of thousands of locations (like McDonald's). In either case, the franchisor represents an established brand and its products or services.\n\nA franchisee, on the other hand, is an individual who pays for a license to operate a branch of a franchisor’s business. A franchisee invests in a franchise by paying a franchisor for the right to use its business’s name, brand, operational model, and other assets for a period of time defined in the franchise agreement. In exchange, the franchisor receives a one-time franchise payment and ongoing royalty payments from the franchisee. \n\nFranchisor \n\nOwns brand and brand assets \nExerts influence over all branded locations\nEarns franchise fee and royalties from all franchisees\nProvides guidance, training, materials, and other assets to franchisees to help them succeed\n\nFranchisee\n\nOwns the right to use brand and assets for a period of time\nOwns and operates one or more business locations for a set period\nPays an initial franchise fee and ongoing royalties to the franchisor for the right to use the brand and its model\nReceives training, guidance, and other assets from the franchisor and uses them to succeed\n\nHow do franchises work? The franchising process from start to finish\n\nFranchise agreements are essentially investment opportunities, both for the franchisor and the franchisee. The franchisee exchanges money for a brand’s assets (recognition, products, services, and strategy), while the franchisor exchanges brand assets for an initial lump-sum payment (the franchise fee) and an ongoing income stream (royalty payments). If the franchisee’s location of the business is successful in their community, the franchisor not only receives periodic, dividend-like royalty payments but also gets the added bonus of increased brand awareness and customer goodwill.\n\nIn many cases, a prospective franchisee must apply and be approved to open a franchise in their area, but since that isn’t always the case, the first real step for both parties is the signing of a franchise agreement.\nThe franchise agreement\n\nA franchise agreement is a legally binding document that, once signed, grants the franchisee the right to operate their branch of the franchise for a certain number of years. This document also outlines the franchisee’s responsibilities, which can include upholding the brand’s standards, generating a certain amount of revenue, using only approved suppliers, and other provisions. If the franchisee violates the terms of the contract, the franchise agreement may be revoked by the franchisor.\n\nThe franchise agreement also details the franchise fee and royalties that must be paid to the franchisor as well as the resources and support the franchisor pledges to offer to the franchisee, both during the new branch’s opening and on an ongoing basis.\nThe franchise fee and other startup costs\n\nTo start a franchise, a franchisee must typically pay a franchisor a one-time franchise payment for the right to begin doing business under the franchisor’s brand. Franchise fees vary quite a bit and can depend on the length of the franchise agreement (how long the franchisor grants the franchisee the right to use its brand system), but most range between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn most cases, the franchisee also needs to purchase or lease a building and equip it to operate as a branch of the business, which often means purchasing equipment and paying for custom renovations to the space. Between a franchise fee and these startup costs, opening a franchise can require a very expensive initial investment, and since there is no guarantee of success, this investment is very risky for the franchisee.\n\nThat being said, this risk is offset to some degree by the fact that the franchisor’s brand has already proved to be profitable in other markets and the brand’s products or services likely already have a customer base. Most new businesses fail, but new franchises may be more likely to succeed because their brand is recognizable, their business model is tested, and demand for their products already exists.\nHiring, training, and grand opening\n\nOnce a franchisee secures and equips their building (if applicable) and hires a team, the franchisor typically helps them market their business in the local community, hire and train staff, host a grand opening, and begin operating.\n\nIn many cases, the franchisor (or a member of their team) may work on-site at the franchisee’s new business for a month or so in order to help establish the brand’s operational model and provide ongoing guidance and support to the franchisee and their new team of employees as they begin to do business.\nOngoing operation and royalty payments\n\nOnce the franchisee and their team get the hang of things, they are typically left to their own devices but can reach out to the franchisor for guidance and resources on an ongoing basis.\n\nAs the franchisee operates their new business, they send periodic royalty payments to the franchisor. Royalty payments are usually a percentage of either profit or revenue and may be paid monthly or quarterly — the details of a franchise’s royalty payments can vary quite a bit and are outlined in detail in the franchise agreement.\nFranchise agreement renewal, modification, or termination\n\nEventually, the terms of the franchise agreement come to an end, and at that point, the franchisor may offer to renew the franchise agreement, propose a modified franchise agreement (sometimes with higher royalty percentages), or simply terminate the franchisee’s right to continue doing business under their brand.\n\nIn most cases, successful franchisees are asked to sign a renewed or updated franchise agreement and continue doing business on behalf of the franchisor's brand. Those who are particularly successful may even be asked if they would like to open additional branches in adjacent geographic markets. \n\nAre franchises more likely to succeed than other new businesses? \n\nMany in the franchising industry claim that franchises have a 95% success rate, citing a 1980s study by the Department of Commerce. The data used to produce this statistic came from a voluntary survey of 2,000 franchisees, only 5% of whom said their franchises failed within the first five years of operation, indicating a 95% rate of success (compared to the 45% five-year survival rate for new businesses at large).\n\nThe 95% figure has become so notorious in the franchising industry that it is colloquially referred to as “the Stat,” but it is widely considered inaccurate due to the fact the data was self-reported, and successful franchisees may have been more inclined to submit responses than those whose businesses folded.\n\nInterestingly, no particularly thorough research has emerged in the decades since the Department of Commerce study to replace the 95% statistic. That being said, most in the industry agree that while the success rate for new franchises probably isn't even close to 95%, a new franchise of a well-known national brand with established demand and corporate operational training (like McDonald’s or Wendy’s) is more likely to succeed than a brand-new business in the same industry built from scratch.\n\nHow does franchising vary between brands?\n\nEvery franchise is different, and they vary quite a bit in terms of startup difficulty, cost, franchisor controls, franchisee support, site selection, and other details. Some franchised businesses are very strictly controlled by the franchisor in order to uphold the brand’s standards across locations, while others give the franchisee more leeway in terms of how they run their business. These specifics are best demonstrated using real-world examples.\n\nAs far as franchised businesses go, Chick-fil-A is known for maintaining particularly rigorous franchisee selection and training processes — not only do prospective franchisees need to demonstrate their qualifications, be selected from a large group of applicants, complete an intensive multi-week training, and pledge a $10,000 initial investment; they also have to be willing to work long hours in the restaurant as a hands-on team member. Chick-fil-A’s leadership specifically notes that prospective franchisees seeking passive income via a hands-off investment opportunity should look elsewhere.\n\nSubway, on the other hand, only requires that prospective franchisees pass a relatively simple, one-hour skills test focused on basic math and English. This means that most anyone with the requisite capital ($10,000–$15,000 plus startup costs) can open a Subway in their area without going through a rigorous application process.\n\nSubway is also unique in that the brand holds the leases for all of its franchised branches and then subleases the locations to the franchisees. It also requires all franchisees to source their supplies and ingredients from the brand’s approved distributors in order to maintain quality across all locations.\n\nMany franchised businesses, like Subway, are fairly lax about franchisee selection (so long as investors have enough capital to open a branch), offering plenty of initial and ongoing support when requested by the franchisee but requiring little of them but their initial and ongoing financial investments and adherence to the brand’s standards.\n\nIn some cases, franchisees of these sorts of businesses can hire an on-site manager to run the business’s day-to-day operations so that they can collect passive income without working on-site all that often. \n\nWhat other expenses do franchisees incur besides the franchise fee and royalty payments?\n\nThe initial franchise fee and periodic royalty payments are just two of the expenses that come with operating a franchise. Every situation is different, but many other fees and expenses can come into play. Some larger franchisors charge all franchisees a mandatory fee for the brand’s ongoing advertising efforts, which may take place on a national scale but benefit all franchise locations.\n\nSome franchisees purchase or lease their own equipment, but in many cases, specific equipment and supplies must be leased directly from the franchisor for a monthly or annual fee. Other common expenses franchisees may incur include payments for mandatory insurance or IT/network support provided by the franchisor.\n\nEvery franchise opportunity is different, and the best way to get a full sense of the expenses associated with operating a specific franchise is to look the brand up on Franchise Direct, which aggregates specific information and data about virtually all common franchises.\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nBelow are answers to some of the most common questions investors and entrepreneurs have about franchises and the franchising process.\nHow do existing business owners franchise their businesses?\n\nTurning an established business into a franchise is a complicated process, but some of the most important steps include creating a franchise disclosure document (FDD) for prospective franchisees as required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), distilling the company’s business model and proprietary knowledge into a cohesive and accessible operations manual, registering the brand’s trademarks, establishing a new franchising company, and registering the FDD with the states in which the franchisor wishes to operate.\nCan franchised businesses be publicly traded?\n\nMany well-known franchises are also publicly traded companies, including McDonald’s  (MCD) , Wingstop  (WING) , Domino’s  (DPZ) , Valvoline  (VVV) , Goosehead Insurance  (GSHD) , Planet Fitness  (PLNT) , The Vitamin Shoppe  (VSI) , and other well-known national and international brands.\nWhat are the best franchises for passive income?\n\nAccording to the International Franchise Professionals Group, a networking organization used by franchisors and franchisees, the best brands for “semi-absentee franchises” — those where the franchisee can typically hire a manager to run day-to-day operations after the startup process is complete — include the following:\n\n    Gameday Men’s Health\n    Everline Coatings\n    Temporary Wall Systems\n    DonutNV\n    Fastest Labs\n\nAre there work-from-home franchise opportunities?\n\nAccording to Franchise Direct, an online franchise information aggregator, the following franchises represent the best opportunities for franchisees who want to do most of their work remotely, from home or elsewhere:\n\n    Healthier 4U Vending\n    Ideal Directories\n    Cruise Planners\n    Hommati\n    SiteSwan Website Builder",

        "articleBody": "TheStreet spoke with a series of artists and experts in human creativity, psychology and artificial intelligence.\n\nBefore she graduated high school, Michele Rosenthal knew that she wanted to dedicate her life to art. \n\nShe had always wanted to be a professional illustrator. When it came time to apply to colleges, she decided to attend art school, where she majored in illustration before becoming a professional freelance artist.\n\n\"What I really love is art,\" she said in an interview with TheStreet.  \n\nBut over the last year — in the wake of the launch of ChatGPT, Stability AI and the like — the business of art has become more difficult. \n\nIndustries that before paid illustrators for their work have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence image generators. The jobs, Rosenthal said, have begun to dry up.\n\nRosenthal's initial response to AI image generation was that there is no real comparison between an artist and an algorithm. A professional artist, she said, brings far more to a job than an output. What she didn't expect was how quickly so many people — with such haste — would choose to adopt AI tools as a means of replacing flesh-and-blood humans. \n\n\"The shockwaves are real,\" she said. \"Artists are definitely feeling the results of everyone adopting this technology so quickly.\" \n\nStill, Rosenthal doesn't think the current bump in the road of the professional artist will be a permanent reality. If people want something new, she said, they still have to turn to a human artist; AI models produce a mere amalgamation of their training data, they don't seem truly creative. \nThe ethics of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence is not a new technology. But with the launch of ChatGPT last year, it became consumer-facing in a whole new way, touching off an AI arms race as startups and tech giants alike raced to be the first to ship products. \n\nThat race has been mirrored in courtrooms and government buildings as regulators have struggled to understand the technology so that they can figure out how best to regulate it. And a debate, meanwhile, has been ongoing within the field about the harms, risks and benefits of AI. \n\nAmong these ethical concerns — which include algorithmic discrimination, misinformation, political instability, data privacy and more — are questions of copyright infringement and fears of job loss. \n\nOver the past few months, several lawsuits have been filed by groups of authors and artists against the companies behind these models. A class action lawsuit, filed in September by the Authors Guild, alleges that Microsoft  (MSFT)  and OpenAI, without providing notice, credit or compensation, use copywritten work as the underpinning of their models. \n\n\"These algorithms are at the heart of Defendants' massive commercial enterprise,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"And at the heart of these algorithms is systematic theft on a mass scale.\"\n\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on this piece. \n\nAnother case, brought by a group of visual artists against Stability AI, Midjourney and other companies, argues a similar premise: \"AI image products are primarily valued as copyright-laundering devices, promising customers the benefits of art without the costs of artists.\"\n\nThe companies involved have argued that the content they train their models on is \"fair use,\" a claim that could, if true, supersede copyright violations. The U.S. Copyright Office said in August that it had undertaken a study of copyright law as it relates to generative AI to determine how best to treat the sector. \n\n\"Training generative AI models in this way is, to me, wrong,\" Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and technologist, wrote in a Nov. 15 op-ed. \"Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works.\"\n\nNewton-Rex in November resigned from his position leading Stability AI's Audio team, based, he said, on a disagreement over the company's impression that copyrighted work is fair use. \n\nSaying that the act of training on copyrighted work amounts to the exploitation of creators, Newton-Rex questioned the model as an unjust disruptor of existing copyright practices in the arts. He has instead supported generative models that are trained only on licensed content and are further transparent about the content in their training sets. \n\nAs the legality of the issue is battled out in court, with the potential result of further enforcing existing laws against copyright infringement in the U.S., there has been a growing point of contention between creatives and those who have embraced AI content and image generators over the myriad nuances of creativity, and the differences between human and algorithmic creation. \n\nTheStreet spoke with a series of experts, including AI researchers, psychologists who specialize in the study of human creativity and the artists themselves about the differences between algorithmic output and human creation, the importance of the creative process, the impact of human creativity and the important differences between art as a hobby and art as a profession, and the ways in which AI can impact both. \n\nHow LLMs 'create'\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) — like ChatGPT — are, at their core, predictive models. Trained on an enormous quantity of data (the first \"L\" in \"LLM\") that includes books, newspaper articles, social media content, photos and videos, the output of any generative AI model is tied directly to its input, something that cannot quite be said for humans.  \n\nThe Atlantic reported in September that a dataset called \"Books3\" was used to train models by Meta, Bloomberg and others. \n\nThe dataset included more than 191,000 books, the basis of a July lawsuit filed against Meta by writers Sarah Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden.\n\nGenerative text models, according to AI researcher Dr. John Licato, essentially output a \"probability distribution that's defined over a set of possible tokens.\" \n\n\"There's a very specific mathematical function that it's trying to optimize when it's doing that training process,\" he told TheStreet. \"It's trying to make it so that the probability distribution best reflects the training data.\"\n\nThough Licato noted some similarities between the creative processes of humans and AI models, he said that there is an \"inherent limit\" to what LLMs can actually output. \nStability diffusion and high-quality datasets\n\nWhen it comes to diffusion image generation — a method employed by Stability AI — models learn the base construction of an image by removing the noise from images in a given dataset so they can produce variations of each image. \n\nThe artist lawsuit against Stability and its peers notes that \"the primary objective of a diffusion model is to reconstruct copies of its training images with maximum accuracy and fidelity.”\n\nThe complaint goes on to cite a research scientist at Google DeepMind, Nicholas Carlini, who in a 2023 research paper stated that \"diffusion models are explicitly trained to reconstruct the training set.\" \n\nDeepFloyd IF, an image generator launched in April by Stability AI, was trained on a high-quality dataset that contained one billion image and text pairs. \n\nStability AI did not respond to TheStreet's request for comment on this piece. \n\nA low-quality dataset will produce low-quality output.\n\nLikewise, a biased dataset will produce a biased output. \n\nAnd without datasets at all, such models would be unable to produce anything. \n\nAI expert and Ivanti CPO Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala told TheStreet that LLMs cannot generalize any more than they can feel. Such models can only 'create' based exclusively on the information in their training set. \n\n\"It doesn't have senses. It doesn't have human empathy behind it,\" Mukkamala said, noting that humans, on the other hand, can both feel and express. \"As a technologist, LLMs are very limited, from the dataset they've been fed with, to the human that's behind it and what you're asking it to answer.\" \n\nHow humans create\n\nHumans, on the other hand, are, as Rosenthal said, much more than a mere algorithm. \n\nThe technical process of human creativity, according to artist and Duke assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience Dr. Paul Seli, is one of generation and evaluation. \n\nThe working hypothesis, he told TheStreet, is that the brain's default mode network — which is active during passive rest — is at work during the generation of creative ideas. \n\nThe brain's prefrontal regions are then associated with the process of determining whether those ideas are any good.\n\nA recent study conducted by Dr. Ariana Anderson, assistant professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA, found highly creative people had more randomness in their brain activity than simply intelligent people.\n\nAI, she told TheStreet in an interview, might be considered \"smart\" due to the size of the datasets the models are trained on. But AI can't \"extrapolate beyond what it's been trained, whereas human brains can.\"\n\nThe random turnings inherent to highly creative brains allow such people, humans, to find and explore new creative areas they \"wouldn't have found if they were pre-programmed.\" \n\nDr. Roger Beaty, creativity expert and assistant professor of psychology at PennState, told TheStreet that, while AI output might sometimes seem novel or creative, it's \"not really a fair comparison because of the vastness of knowledge that the AI has access to.\"\n\nIndeed, current LLMs, according to Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, are trained on text data that he said would take a human \"20,000 years to read.\" \n\nRegardless, Beaty said that AI models \"don't have experiential episodic memory, which is also kind of relevant to creativity when you think about drawing on personal experiences for inspiration.\"\n\nThe source of that personal inspiration, according to Seli, more than just being fueled by personal experiences and emotions, comes from a deeply human attempt to \"take our subjective experience and share it with other people.\" \n\nHuman inspiration, Seli said, goes far beyond a 'training set' of previously consumed art, literature or music. \n\n\"One of the primary purposes of art is to serve as a communicative element of our inner experience,\" Seli said. \"We can share emotions in ways that words can't capture.\" \nWhy humans create\n\nHow humans get inspired and create represents an important distinction between the strictly mathematical process that AI algorithms utilize. \n\nBut the answer to the question of why humans create is perhaps more important. \n\nSeli conducted a study in July where participants were asked to grade how creative they found a given set of artworks. The entire set of artwork featured exclusively AI-generated art, though the labels each participant saw — which categorized a work as either human or machine-made — were randomized. \n\nThe study concluded that people found allegedly human-produced art to be more creative than AI art. \n\n\"If we think that a human did it, then we assume that the art is communicating some experience, and then we like it because we can relate to it or we can gain some sort of empathic insight into what it's like to be that person,\" Seli said. \"But with AI, we don't have the same empathic experience.\"\n\nSeli noted an inherent emptiness to the communicative abilities of AI art, a sentiment that was echoed by new media artist Eryk Salvaggio. \n\nA viewer can look at an AI-generated image and be moved by it, but regardless of the viewer's impression, \"there's nothing on the other side of that communication. There's no intention in that communication. There's no meaning in that communication.\"\n\nAnd it is that need to communicate that, according to Seli, remains at the very core of what art is and why humans are so drawn to it. It all comes down to a powerful human urge to take isolated experiences and establish a wider level of connection. \n\n\"The more welcome we feel in this existence, the more understood. And I think that's the point,\" Salvaggio said. \n\nThe creation of art, even on the professional level, holds true to that base value of a need for raw, human expression. \n\nThe dataset that artists work with, Rosenthal said, goes far beyond reference shots, encompassing instead \"everything we've ever experienced and every emotion that we've ever had.\" \n\nRosenthal said that at the core of all human art is a powerful urge to symbolically express some element of the artist's human experience. \n\nA certain brushstroke, or a particular passage from a poem, or, Seli said, a musical melody, can elicit a strong emotional response from a varied audience. That response is the result of intimate human connection. \n\nThe act of creating art, for David Depasquale, a professional artist who has worked as an art director and character designer in television, has been an avenue for personal expression and escapism throughout his life. \n\nPursuing it professionally was a \"need.\"\n\n\"It was the only place that I found where my mind just was quiet for a little while,\" he told TheStreet.\n\nThe importance of that process and that personal expression is on display in his professional work as much as it is in his personal work.\n\nNone of Depasquale's work comes from a cold place of pure output, a common misconception about an artist's approach when working professionally.\n\n\"I get hired as an artist personally for my sensibilities, for my ideas, for my experiences in life and where I've come from,\" Depasquale said. \"Every single character I've designed is from a very personal place.\"\n\nGood artists, he said, are not just hired for their output, they are hired for the unique humanity, process and soul that they bring to the job of creation, which is why he's not concerned about AI taking his job. \n\n\"You have to draw from something personally to be able to communicate something that someone else is going to recognize and translate,\" Rosenthal said, noting that the process of exploring artistic inspiration revolves around answering certain questions of \"what is the image in my mind that I want to make?\" and \"what is the feeling that I want it to evoke?\" \n\nThis need for symbolic emotional expression — a passion that drove both Rosenthal and Depasquale to pursue art professionally — points to the more philosophical nature of art itself: the vibrant soul ensconced within a piece of art, and the vitality of an often laborious artistic process. \n\nThe soul of art\n\nArt, according to Depasquale, is far more than just the final product. \n\nAnd artists are far more than their output. \n\n\"You don't play the piece of music you're playing just to get to the end. You play it for the joy of playing the whole thing,\" Depasquale told TheStreet. \"The reality is that the whole process is the art and that's what AI removes.\" \n\nA growing obsession with \"efficiency and instant gratification\" has, according to Depasquale, fueled the recent proliferation of artificially generated art, something that is merely the latest evolution in the ongoing and damaging commoditization of art itself. \n\n\"You hear a piece of AI-generated music and it might sound nice on the surface, but there's nothing behind it,\" he said. \"It's empty. It's an empty door; you can't go through it.\"\n\nPublic conversation that focuses on the economics of art, rather than its inherent emotionality, has further enhanced this perspective. \n\nStill, Depasquale does not hate AI, nor does he think AI will take away his livelihood. AI, he said, is a machine and a tool. \n\nIt \"has no emotions.\" \n\nThe real issue Depasquale has with AI is the \"humans behind it, and how they've chosen to wield this tool.\" \n\n\"I'm more afraid of the devaluation of art than I am of a machine taking my job,\" he said. \nThe value of human creativity \n\nA world without art and creativity, Seli said, \"would be a hell of a lonely place for us.\" \n\nRosenthal said that this point represents the \"secret weapon\" of art itself, something that \"AI will never be able to produce.\" \n\n\"Art making is about human connection and really good art can create more empathy,\" she said. \"The experience of connecting with someone else's experience; that's really powerful. That's what makes art so valuable.\"\n\n\"I hope that doesn't get lost.\"\n\nBut in a more macro sense, human creativity — stretching beyond the arts — improves human society, according to Dr. Anderson. Every technological revolution human society has experienced, Anderson said, was incited by highly creative people. \n\n\"Technology can be very beneficial when it is developed by creative people because it can really alleviate human suffering around the world,\" she said. \"But we should always remember that the creative people are the ones who should be guiding it.\"\n\nAnd if human society begins to over-rely on AI as a means of replacing artists and art with algorithmically derived, mathematical amalgamations of the art it was trained on, the result, according to Depasquale, could be the downfall of civilization. \n\n\"It sounds hyperbolic. And I kind of mean it to be, but I think that is what destroys human civilization,\" he said. \"The arts and creativity is what kept humans going since the dawn of time. Creative people are the people who are the keepers of culture and the keepers of human civilization.\"\n\nWhen there is nothing else left, Depasquale said, there is still art, which can be made with a stick in the mud as much as it can be made on a computer or with a pen and paper. \n\nThe history of humanity can be traced through art and the stories that art has told. This transcends language and modernity, stretching back to the time of the Neanderthal and their cave paintings that today inform historians how they lived.\n\n\"People always have this instinct to create. And I think removing that or trying to remove that from humanity will destroy humanity,\" he said. \"Human culture is exhibited through art; you can't remove that from humanity. That's like taking out somebody's heart. They can't survive without that.\"\n\nArt represents the essence and importance of boundless human communication, communication not fettered by the constructs of language or time. And the essence, or soul, of that, Depasquale said, cannot be artificially produced. \n\n\"No matter how minutely detailed AI can get, you can never manufacture that, you can't manufacture vision through an artist's eyes or hands or whatever they're using to create,\" he said. \"That's the end of civilization.\"\n\nIntentionality in co-creativity\n\nDespite its already-established ability and ongoing potential to wreak havoc and harm across the professional art industry, some are looking at AI as a tool that, with the right intentions, can be used to help enhance human creativity, rather than limit it. \n\nSeli noted preliminary findings in which the artists themselves seem to be better at using AI image generators than non-artists. \n\n\"It's a tool. It doesn't level the playing field in some equality of outcome way with art,\" he said. \"It's just new tools, and you can use them or not, but if you're better at painting a piece you seem to be better at using DALL-E.\"\n\nThough he is sure that people will take advantage of these models, Seli found that it can be useful on occasion as a sounding board, an initial step in his own process of artistic inspiration and creation. \n\nFor Salvaggio, who recently taught a course on AI art at Bradley University, generative AI represents an enormous tool with countless creative possibilities. \n\nArt, he told TheStreet, is not the commercial pursuit of image creation. There is much more nuance to the field, and to the kinds of creativity AI can enable and enhance, and the ways in which AI can limit creativity. \n\nIn his artistic work with AI, Salvaggio is always attempting to figure out ways in which he can essentially trick an AI model into making something new.\n\nMuch of the work he's done with AI has been through a lens of \"creative misuse.\" \n\nThe reason for this approach is that Salvaggio doesn't trust the datasets that power these models, and so doesn't want to rely on them when using them to create a piece of art that is unique to him. \n\n\"Most artists don't want to create something that is so literally in dialogue with things that they don't know,\" he said. \"If I want to make work that is in dialogue with other artists, I want to choose how that is represented and I want to choose what that conversation is.\"\n\nIn the act of prompting an AI model, Salvaggio doesn't have much say in what image the model spits out. There is no dialogue with other artists, there is no credit to other artists and there is no ability to extend a story begun by other artists. There is only the generation of an abstraction of other work. \n\nSuch models also pose an additional challenge to creatives who are attempting to break new ground; no artist, Salvaggio said, wants to put something out there that \"runs the risk of being something that someone else has done.\" \n\nPrompting alone is not enough. \n\nAnd relying on prompting is creatively limiting — a user might get outputs that are almost exactly what they asked for, something that jeopardizes the relationship between artist and art through something Salvaggio called \"curational creativity.\" \n\nThe central component of his creative process is \"screwing up, making the thing you didn't want to make and the learning that comes from that.\" \n\n\"There's a constant flow between myself and the work that I'm making where I am putting something in to the best of my capacities, seeing the limits of those capacities, and then calibrating to what's on the page,\" he said. \"There's almost a dialogue with the ideas that are in my head and the ideas that are being expressed.\"\n\nThe challenges, posed by AI, that exist within Salvaggio's new media space are the same faced by many traditional artists. \n\nThe limits of a person's artistic capabilities, Salvaggio said, are usually defined in terms of commercial viability, which is a violation of the artistic process. \n\nThe artistic process is about \"our relationship to making\" and \"finding a way to express ourselves within our own minds,\" he said. The idea that AI image generators democratize art suggests that art isn't inherently democratic; it \"isn't a problem with art. It's a problem with the market.\"\n\nAs such, Salvaggio's biggest concern is not about AI, something he engages with as a tool, but with the profession of art itself. \n\nCreativity, he said, will always exist, a sentiment that was echoed almost verbatim by everyone TheStreet spoke with for this piece: AI will not and cannot stop human artistic creation. \n\nThe real question at hand is the industry of professional art, from illustrators to writers and actors, and issues of exploitation and job loss. \n\n\"Humans are naturally creative. We've been making art since the beginnings of human history and we're not going to stop anytime soon,\" Rosenthal said. \"I think it's a shame that the people who are hiring artists seem to have lost respect for artists, seem to think that artists could be replaced by something that is just an algorithm.\"",

I have always felt like the lucky caretaker of something much bigger than any one person, something of real value that belongs to everyone and no one.\n\n\"I feel a deep responsibility to perform it (and experience it) live, in front of real people, with all of the peril and imperfection front and center.\n\n\"The song gives people permission to reflect, to sit in chaos, loss, change, and (hopefully) find beauty and community in the midst of isolation.  I feel it too, every single time I sing it, even 20 years later.”\n\nBorn in Fresno, California and raised in the surf culture of San Diego, Gary began his journey as a singer-songwriter in the late 90s.\n\nThroughout his career, he has graced stages worldwide including Glastonbury, T in the Park and Latitude Festival, as well as features on Top of the Pops and BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge and a three-week run with Bob Dylan, from Ireland to Portugal.",

If I have to read another script line...\n\n\"My head is ready to explode. For the past six days I've had to learn a full script, dance songs for panto that I don't know or I've never even heard of.\"\n\nShe added: \"On top of that my nerves.

I'm alright going on telly, podcasting, talking about myself, but when you've got to learn a script and you've got people who have paid for tickets you've got to be good.\"\n\nShe also said the stress meant her bid to give up vaping lasted only one day.\n\n\"I gave up vaping for one day and I'm back on it,\" she said.\n\n\"I've got all the kids here in a two-bedroom apartment.\n\nKatie will get Christmas Day off but will be back on stage from Boxing Day to December 30.\n\nShe added on her podcast: \"I can't wait for New Year's Eve and I'm doing nothing. \n\n\"I probably won't even be awake at midnight, I'll be asleep.

        "articleBody": "The tech giant plans to use the Creuziger family’s land to build a multi-building data center, all part of a $1 billion investment in the village of Mount Pleasant.\n\nA Wisconsin family has agreed to sell 407 acres of their land, which includes a local pumpkin farm attraction, to Microsoft — for a total of $76 million, reported the Milwaukee Business Journal. The local government initially offered the Creuziger family in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin about a third of that sum in 2017 as a part of an agreement with the Foxconn Technology Group. But the family refused, opting to hold out for a better offer.\n\n“The family wishes the village and Microsoft well, and they would appreciate people respecting their privacy,” the family’s attorney David Barnes told the Business Journal. \n\nMicrosoft’s payout is significantly larger than the land’s current valuation. The Creuziger family’s land was originally valued at $174,200 in 2023, but then rose to $598,400 after making improvements, Mount Pleasant’s village assessor Dan McHugh told The Verge.\n\nThe land, which also includes the Land of the Giants pumpkin farm and a nine-acre corn maze, neighbors another 641 acres of land purchased by Microsoft from the village of Mount Pleasant — for a total of $99.7 million. The end goal for Microsoft is to build a data center campus in the area, in which it plans to invest over $1 billion. \n\nAll told, the sale is a happy ending for the village, after several years of confusion and mixed signals from Foxconn. It’s only been two years since Foxconn drastically scaled back its promised $10 billion investment in Mount Pleasant, which would have included a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant.\n\nThe Milwaukee Business Journal reported that Microsoft plans to initially hire 200 employees at its Mount Pleasant data center — and could add over 460 jobs over time.

        "articleBody": "This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. You can also text HOME to 741741 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources. \n\nTragedy is at the forefront of the Von Erich family’s history, so much so that when creating a movie about the wrestling dynasty some parts — and people — had to be omitted.\n\n“The Iron Claw” tells the story of professional wrestler Fritz Von Erich (Holt McCallany) and his four sons Kevin (Zac Efron), Kerry (Jeremy Allen White), David (Harris Dickinson) and Mike (Stanley Simons) as they attempt to become heavyweight champions and household names in the wrestling world. Along the way, the family faces hardships and multiple deaths that are blamed on the “Von Erich curse.”\n\nA younger brother, Chris Von Erich, was left entirely out of the film. Director and writer Sean Durkin explains to TODAY.com why that choice was made, and the reaction the real-life Kevin Von Erich, the last surviving family member, had when finding out that one of his brothers was not in the film.\n\nWhy Chris Von Erich isn't in 'The Iron Claw'\n\n“The Iron Claw,” Durkin says, had been in development since 2015. Over the years, there were several versions of the story and cuts were made in order to preserve the quality and length of the film.\n\n“One of the hardest decisions possible was cutting Chris,” the director explains. “And the reason why (is), Chris was in the script for a lot of years and I loved him and loved his character. But ultimately as a writer and filmmaker, I had to separate the real humans from the characters on the page at some point.”\n\nDurkin says there was a “repetition in the brothers’ deaths” that made the film seem unrealistic. “I just didn’t believe (the movie) could sort of withstand one more tragedy.”\n\nThere were originally six Von Erich brothers. Fritz Von Erich and wife Doris’ oldest son, Jack Barton Jr., died at the age of 7 after he was accidentally electrocuted by a live wire.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1993, four brothers died. David Von Erich died suddenly from enteritis in 1984, while Kerry, Mike and Chris Von Erich died by suicide.\n\nAll the deaths are either mentioned or depicted in “The Iron Claw,” except Chris Von Erich's.\n\nDurkin says that in removing Chris Von Erich's story, Mike Von Erich became a combination of the two brothers.\n\nAccording to a 1997 story by the Dallas Observer, Chris Von Erich had a smaller frame than his brothers and was weaker from his asthma and medication that stunted his growth and made his bones fragile.\n\n\"He had pressure from himself and maybe from the fans, too. Sometimes fans can be cruel. They don’t know what they’re doing, but they can say things like, ‘Hey, are you gonna be a wrestler when you grow up?’ and things like that. They would just crush Chris, because he never got tall and healthy,\" Kevin Von Erich told the publication. \n\nChris Von Erich died by suicide in 1991 at the age of 21. \n\nWhat did Kevin Von Erich think about Chris Von Erich being removed from the film?\n\nDurkin says he was “very nervous” about showing Kevin Von Erich the film. They had developed a long-standing open dialogue about the project, but Durkin hadn't shown the former wrestler the script or the final version of the movie.\n\nHe says that the day before he was going to finally screen \"The Iron Claw\" for Kevin Von Erich and his family, he did a Zoom with them.\n\n“I was going to, sort of, prepare them on some of the big headline things and one of them, the major one, being Chris,” he recalls, adding that he built up the moment of telling the family in his head.\n\n“I was so nervous and Kevin was like, ‘Well, I totally understand.’ He’s like, ‘You don’t want the film to be about grief, and you don’t want to be stuck in that grief too long. And so I understand.’ And that was it,” he says. “And he was really loving and supportive of it.”\n\nWhat did Kevin Von Erich think about 'The Iron Claw'?\n\nDespite the tragedies depicted in the film, “The Iron Claw” focuses on the love and familial support the brothers had. While their father was domineering and pushed them into the ring (and past their limits), there are lighthearted moments that Kevin Von Erich enjoyed.\n\n“I think he was really happy that some focuses on the good times and the brotherly love, and as well as Kevin’s survival and sort of resurrection, if you will,” Durkin says of Kevin Von Erich’s reaction to the film. “I think he felt really good about that, as opposed to if it just entirely focused on the tragedy, which obviously it doesn’t shy away from, but it’s certainly not the core of what the movie is.”\n\nHe adds that he believes Kevin Von Erich was “really relieved about that.”\n\nThe 66-year-old Kevin Von Erich shared his own feelings on the movie in an interview with \"Extra\" at the “Iron Claw” premiere in Dallas in November.\n\n“There’s some touching scenes and I’m glad that they got the love between Kevin and Fritz because that was definitely there,” he said. “And people could watch the movie and think that Fritz was a tyrant when he really wasn’t.”\n\nHe said that his father was strict and hard on them, but they were boys in Texas. “He instilled strength in us, but discipline,” he continued. “And I can only be grateful to my dad for the great job he did being a father. But there were times when we got cross.”",

To the surprise of many, Beyoncé stepped out and greeted her fans.\n\nThe singer later shared some stunning behind-the-scenes photos from her trip and the event on Instagram, including snaps of her on a private jet, her appearance on stage and photos of her holding up a Brazilian flag.\n\nHer publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, also shared photos of Beyoncé, who dazzled the crowd in a silver sequined dress that featured a cape.\n\n\"Move out the way when the queen touches down in Bahia, Brazil!! what a time! Thank you Brazil. Thank you @tvglobo. Thank you @idw.company. And my partner in this RENAISSANCE journey, @justeenahoh!!! You are a fierce queen! Photos by @mason.poole,\" Noel-Schure captioned the post.\n\nIn video shared on X, the singer can be heard telling the crowd, “I came because I love you so much.”\n\nFans were screaming for the multi-Grammy-winning artist. In one Instagram story shared by Brazilian entertainment website Hugo Gloss, she tells the rowdy crowd, “Everybody on mute,” with no one following directions because of excitement.\n\n“It was very important to be here, right here,” she can be seen telling the crowd in another Instagram story shared by the outlet.\n\nPrior to her surprise appearance, Bey had been teasing her followers with clues. \n\nHours earlier she posted a photo of a private jet with her iconic “Renaissance” silver horse peeking from the open door.\n\nShe also changed her location on her Instagram profile, which shows a red pin next to Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. \n\nOn Dec. 19, the “Alien Superstar” singer announced that her tour film was being extended to 15 additional countries, including Brazil.\n\n“Y’all didn’t have to break my website,” the singer is heard saying over a teaser announcing the news. “But I told y’all, the renaissance is not over.”\n\n“Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” was released in the U.S. on Dec. 1. Following a couple red carpet events, one held in London with Taylor Swift attending, Bey shared a heartfelt message about the project.\n\nThanking AMC Theatres and everyone who worked on the film, she said she couldn't thank people enough for their support and outpouring love.\n\n“It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done because of the short turn around time,” she wrote on Instagram on Dec. 6. “I practically slept in the edit, color, and mix sessions. The race against time continued in order to get this film out so quickly. But it was so worth all the grind.”\n\nShe added, in part, that she loved “seeing everyone all dressed up in their most opulent lewks in the theaters. The mute challenges still happening, even in the theater!! Y’all are cracking me up. Please keep that energy going. I can’t wait to see what else yall do.”",

        "articleBody": "A Top Gear Guilty Pleasure: despite its bug-eyed looks and Fisher Price interior, the SRC is still desirable\n\nMuch like a particular yeast extract spread that can’t be named here for legal reasons, it’d be fair to say that you either love breadvans, or you can’t understand why someone would graft the rear of an estate onto a sports car.\n\nI will happily admit that I am in the former camp. I love the look of a breadvan and it fills me with joy to know that cars like the BMW Z3 M Coupe, the Reliant Scimitar and the Lotus Europa actually made production.\n\nAnd then there’s the Smart Roadster Coupe. Try as I might, I can’t shake the want/need to own one of these teeny, plastic-bodied sports cars.\n\nAlthough, with its powertrain (a turbocharged 698cc three-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automated manual gearbox) taken from the Fortwo née City-Coupe, it’s a bit of a stretch to actually call the Roadster a sports car. The Coupe iteration could only be paired with the more powerful 80bhp engine, but even that only allowed for a 0-62mph time of over 10 seconds. The gearchanges were also so slow and laggy, you could actually make a Marmite sandwich (whoops) before it shifted from second to third. Oh, and don’t get me started on the Fisher Price interior.\n\nAnd yet, the Roadster Coupe is still attractive because it’s a properly lightweight little thing (it tips the scales at just north of 800kg) with mid-engined balance and a decent amount of storage space from a rear shelf and front boot.\n\nHeck, even the name isn’t as silly as it sounds. Even though this big-booted version is a breadvan-coupe type design, it’s also still a roadster because Smart retained the choice of either a removable targa roof or an electric sliding soft-top. Clever.\n\nPlus, actual Gordon Murray used a Roadster as his daily driver before the Alpine A110 came along, and he’s a man who knows a thing or two about lightweighting.\n\nA quick glance at the classifieds today shows that Roadster Coupes can be picked up for less than £5,000, while Brabus versions with an extra 20bhp, excellent alloy wheels and a centre-exit exhaust start at roughly £6,000. Bit of a bargain that, no?",

        "authors": "Ayush Arya",
        "date": "2023-12-22",
        "articleBody": "Beyond its supercharged V-8 heart, find out how Ford's flagship desert runner wearing the R badge, distinguishes itself from the standard F-150 Raptor\n\nThe 2023 Ford F-150 Raptor is a beast of a truck. Its twin-turbocharged V6 cranks 450 horsepower, pushing it to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. But Ford has decided to dial up the Raptor's capability by introducing the new Raptor R, which takes things further up a notch. An engine swap is the biggest upgrade that the 2023 Raptor R gets over the standard Raptor. Instead of the twin-turbo V6, the more potent Raptor comes with the 5.2-liter supercharged V-8 sourced from the Mustang GT500. Here, the eight-cylinder engine cranks out 700 horsepower.\n\nBut a high-output V8 isn't the only upgrade you get in the Raptor R for the $109,990 MSRP. The $30,000 difference also gives you a ton of other goodies that make the Raptor R a lot more capable on off-road terrain. In this article, we have compiled a list of ten things that make the 2023 Ford Raptor R the ultimate King of Off-Road. So read along if you want to know why this full-sized truck still reigns supreme for factory-made high-speed desert runners.\n\nShelby GT500's 5.2L Supercharged Predator V-8\n700-Horsepower Under The Hood\n\nThe twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 in the standard Raptor cranks 450 horsepower and 510 pound-feet of torque. Compared to that, the 5.2-liter supercharged Predator V8 in the Raptor R produces 700 horsepower and 640 pound-feet of torque. That is a difference of 250 horsepower and 130 pound-feet.\n\nUpgraded Engine Components For Peak Off-Road Performance\nHigh-Performance Engine Internals And Advanced Cooling System\n\nFord hasn't just picked the supercharged Predator V8 from the GT500 and dropped it under the hood of the Raptor R. The engine has been thoroughly worked upon and given several new high-performance parts to optimize it for the way it'll be used in this high-performance off-road truck for high-speed dune bashing.\nThe 5.2-liter Predator V8 Has Been Upgraded For The Raptor R\n\n    The engine gets cast stainless steel exhaust headers to improve exhaust flow and enhance strength.\n    Ford has added a bigger cast aluminum oil pan to ensure optimal engine lubrication when going over aggressive inclines.\n    The V8 now has a unique air intake system with a conical air filter that increases the air intake volume by 66% over the standard Raptor.\n   \n The Raptor R gets a unique engine oil cooler and supercharger intercooler for off-road driving.\n\nBesides improving the engine with advanced internals, Ford has also tweaked its 2.65-liter supercharger to ensure peak performance for off-road use. The updates, which include minor recalibration and the addition of a new pulley, make the supercharger deliver more torque in the low and mid-range of the power band.\n\nHeavy Duty Transmission And Driveline Components\nMore Robust Torque Converter And New Front Axle\n\nThe higher power and torque output from the bigger V8 will stress the standard driveline components more. To ensure that the Raptor R puts the supercharged engine's power down most efficiently during off-road use, Ford has also overhauled the transmission and other essential driveline parts available on the standard Raptor for the Raptor R.\nThe Raptor R Gets The Following Upgrades Over The Standard Raptor\n\n    A new front axle with heavy-duty carrier casting and aluminum-ribber structural cover\n    Unique Driveshaft with a larger diameter\n    A specially tuned torque converter with heavy-duty turbine dampers\n    Four-pinion rear output assembly\n\nThe Raptor R comes with the same 10-speed SelectShift automatic transmission as the Raptor. But, here, Ford has recalibrated the gearbox to match the engine's higher power output. According to the brand, all these updates will allow for a smoother and more efficient way to manage the additional torque from the V8.\n\nOff-Road Optimized Baja Mode\nMultiple Driving Modes For Different Driving Conditions\n\nThe Raptor R isn't locked into one setting for engine power delivery, suspension, and steering feedback. Like the standard Raptor, the R has multiple driving modes calibrated to deliver the best performance on and off-road.\nRaptor R Comes With Normal, Sport, Quiet, and Baja Modes\n\n    Driving modes can be adjusted in the MyMode feature.\n    Switching between the modes allows for a change in multiple settings related to power delivery, steering response, and suspension calibration.\n    The \"R\" button can save a single mode for easy access.\n    Baja mode has been optimized for peak engine performance and high-speed handling in off-road use. Besides changing other settings, it raises the front spring rate by 5% to ensure a comfortable ride no matter the terrain.\n\nChanging the driving modes also changes the exhaust note of the Raptor R. The high-performance truck comes with a dual exhaust system with Ford's true-pass-through muffler and an active valve system to make it sound as throaty as possible.\n\nFox Live Valve Shock Absorbers\nElectronically Controlled Dampers With Height Sensors\n\nA more powerful V8 engine, beefier transmission, and heavy-duty driveline parts give the Raptor R an edge over the standard Raptor. But this high-performance truck shines off-road with its excellent suspension setup, as Ford has ensured that it gets one of the best in business - Fox Live Valve Shocks.\nA Great Suspension Setup Makes The Raptor R One Of The Best Off Road Trucks\n\n    Raptor R has a five-link rear suspension with longer trailing arms for optimal axle position on rough landscapes.\n    To ensure adequate stability when going over desert terrain at high speeds, the Raptor R comes with a Panhard rod and 24-inch coil springs.\n    The truck has Fox Live Value shocks with electronically controlled dampers and height sensors.\n\nThe sensors on the Fox shocks can monitor the terrain multiple times every second and adjust accordingly to provide a stable ride. They also offer 13 inches of suspension travel at the front and 14.1 at the back, which is plenty to go over challenging obstacles.\n\nBigger Tires With Higher Ground Clearance\nBeadlock-Capable Wheels\n\nThe Raptor R rides on 37-inch BFGoodrich all-terrain tires, available as an option on the F-150 Raptor. The standard truck comes with 35-inch tires wrapped around 17-inch Beadlock-capable wheels. The wheel size stays the same for the Raptor R, but here, these are made of forged aluminum instead of cast aluminum wheels, which are available on the Raptor.\n\nThe Raptor R also has a higher ground clearance than the standard truck. It offers a ride height of 13.1 inches, compared to 12.0 inches on the Raptor. The rest of the measurements remain the same between the two trucks. The R, however, offers a higher tow rating of 8,700 pounds, up 500 pounds over the Raptor.\n\nBetter Approach, Departure, And Break-over Angles\nBetter Mobility On Rough Terrain\n\nThe standard Raptor already has impressive approach, departure, and break-over angles, making it agile on off-road terrain. But the raised ride height and bigger tires give the Raptor R a slight edge over the standard truck, making it more maneuverable when going off the tarmac.\n\nThough the length and width of the two trucks remain the same, the Raptor R also has a larger front (74.3 inches compared to 74.0 inches) and rear (73.9 inches compared to 73.6 inches) track width than the Raptor.\n\nRevised Exterior Styling\nExclusive Code Orange 'R' Badges\n\nTo make the Raptor R stand out, Ford has given it a bunch of exclusive decals and badges on the outside. Besides a darker shade for certain trim pieces, the supercharged Raptor also comes with a bigger and meaner-looking power dome on the hood. Ford says that not only does it give an aggressive look to the truck, but it also helps extract larger quantities of warm air from the engine.\nThe 2023 Raptor R Comes With Several Visual Tweaks\n\n    Blacked out front grille, bumpers, and fender flares.\n    Code Orange 'R' badges on the grille, power dome, and tailgate.\n    Cracked desert earth graphic on the rear fenders\n\nUnique Touches Exclusive To The Raptor R's Sporty Cockpit\n\nThe Raptor R retains much of the practicality of the standard Ford F-150's cabin, but this being the most extreme high-performance model in the lineup up receives a few unique touches to set it apart from teh rest of the lineup. The exterior styling tweaks carry over to the inside of the Raptor R\nRaptor R Embelishments In The Sporty Cockpit Include\n\n    Recaro sports seats finished in black leather with Alcantara suede\n    Genuine carbon fiber trim on the dashboard and instrument panel, media bin door, and door pads\n    Code Orange accents on the seats, dashboard, and center armrest\n\nSmart Off-Road Technology\nStandard 12-inch Touch Screen With SYNC 4\n\nBesides dropping a 700-horsepower supercharged V-8 under its hood, upgrading its transmission and suspension components, and adding a bunch of visual updates, Ford has also given the Raptor R a sizable kit of off-road tech. These features are designed to make navigating this giant truck on rough terrain easier.\nThe Raptor R Comes With A Bunch Of Off-Road Driver Assistance Tech\n\n    Trail-Turn Assist: It reduces the turning radius of this truck so that it can effortlessly take tight turns.\n    Ford Trail Control: An off-road cruise control that accelerates and brakes automatically to navigate on rough terrain.\n    Trail 1-Pedal Drive: Allows the driver to control the throttle and brake from one pedal to make going over challenging obstacles easier.\n\nThe Raptor R has a 12-inch central touchscreen loaded with Ford's SYNC 4 tech. The system also offers Apple CarPlay, Android Auto Connectivity, and over-the-air updates.",

        "authors": "James O'Neil",
        "date": "2023-12-24",
        "articleBody": "For several years, solid-state batteries have been like the stars at night. For various reasons, SSBs just never seem ready to leave the laboratory. However, Honda has come up with a small but crucial design change that could finally push solid-state batteries out of the research center and onto the pavement: inner protective layers. This may put an end to dendrites, a problem that has beset solid-state batteries for years. Honda claims that its SSBs can last 500,000 miles before they are finally exhausted.\n\nHonda May Have Eliminated Dendrites \n\nWhen it comes to one of the most persistent problems in solid-state batteries, Honda has found a solution so basic that it almost shouldn’t work: put protective coverings over the problem areas inside the battery. To be a little more precise, Honda has put polymer layers over the electrodes in the battery to prevent tiny crystals called dendrites from forming. While nothing has managed to hit the road yet, preliminary tests are promising enough to justify an enthusiastic volley of press releases.\n\nTo put it into very simplified terms, if a solid-state battery uses lithium, the metal can separate out from the electrolyte in which it is suspended and form crystals called dendrites on the battery's electrodes (the points where the stored energy gets sent out of the battery).\n\nUnder a microscope, the dendrites look like small spiny trees. These crystals can start puncturing the various layers within the battery. Since the dendrites are made of metal, electricity can jump through them, going places where it shouldn’t. In other words, the battery can short-circuit itself from within.\n\nWhile scientists aren’t precisely certain how dendrites form, the crystals don’t spontaneously generate throughout the electrolyte contained in the battery. Instead, they only form on the electrodes as the battery ages. The electrodes tend to form tiny little cracks (the term “microfissures” pops up a lot) after the battery is repeatedly drained and recharged. This is because the electrodes, like literally anything made of metal, expand and contract with temperature changes. Like trees sprouting from cracks in concrete, the dendrites form in the electrodes’ age-related fissures.\n\nWhile dendrites aren’t the only reason a solid-state battery might reach the end of its useful life, they are one of the more common causes of death. Preventing dendrites would make solid-state batteries last a lot longer, even if scientists did nothing else to improve them.\n\nHonda’s Solution To A Persistent Battery Problem\n\nHonda’s battery design puts a polymer layer between the electrode and the electrolyte. Electricity passes through this protective barrier, but nothing else. If the electrolyte never touches the electrode, there is no place for the crystals to take root. In theory, the battery's electrode can get as many fissures as it wants. They will all remain dendrite-free.\n\nHonda’s Unrealized EV Potential \n\nHonda continues to sell small cars, while American companies have given up.\n\nHonda's reputation for reliability will give it an early sales boost when it makes its first big attempts to develop an EV lineup.\n\nBecause Honda is known for both dependable and sporty cars (most companies stick to one or the other), it has a double advantage when it introduces a solid-state battery.\n\nHonda’s always-impressive sales figures continuously disprove the claims from the American Big Three that “Americans don’t buy cars anymore.” While Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis have pivoted to SUVs, Honda can barely crank out Civics and Accords fast enough. Now that Honda (together with other Asian manufacturers) has essentially superseded American companies when it comes to selling sedans, the Japanese automaker may take over the growing EV market as well. An EV with a lifelong battery would be hard to compete with.\n\nHonda’s Reputation Would Make EV Sales Easier\n\nWhile Toyota is the undisputed leader of reliable Japanese cars, Honda has always been a respectably close second. Honda’s vehicles are consistently praised for their longevity. Like Toyota, this long history of dependable vehicles gives Honda a lot of leeway in what it can successfully sell to the public. People are more willing to trust unfamiliar technology when it comes from a manufacturer whose cars never die. Honda’s reputation also helps make part sales pitch before anyone has actually seen the vehicle.\n\nAll of this is to say that Honda’s name does half the sales pitch for it. If Honda starts putting out EVs with as-yet-unused solid-state batteries, the barrier of consumer skepticism will be trivial or nonexistent.\n\nThe Formidable Threat Of EVs That Are Both Sporty And Dependable\n\nHonda has long maintained a double reputation as a manufacturer of steadfast cars and also of easily-modified sleepers. No other automaker has managed to straddle both sides of the sporty-versus-reliable divide as successfully and profitably as Honda has.\n\nWhen it finally makes a serious entry into the EV market instead of selling a single paint-by-numbers SUV, its longstanding reputation will make it formidable competition even to the current standard-bearer Tesla. For now, the rest of the auto industry has a reprieve. Honda’s electric dreams seem to be tied to the solid-state battery that is not yet ready for the road.\n\nThe Ongoing Allure Of Solid-State Batteries \n\nSolid-state batteries have many advantages over the lithium-ion batteries currently in use.\n\nMany other car companies are trying to develop them.\n\nToyota has been working on SSBs for years.\n\nSolid-state batteries remain a long-cherished wish of the automotive industry. To hear some people talk about it at press conferences, one might think SSBs would solve every problem that has ever occurred on four wheels. They weigh less than conventional EV batteries, charge faster, last longer (dendrites notwithstanding), and may even be cheaper to manufacture. However, making them roadworthy has proven to be notoriously difficult.\n\nThis is not to say that solid-state batteries are a useless technology. However, until the auto industry started poking at them, SSBs were only used in very small devices (pacemakers, RFIDs, hearing aids, wearable technology, etc). A lot of the batteries’ shortcomings only become near-insurmountable when attempting to make comparatively gargantuan ones.\n\nHonda Vs. Toyota: Rivals In Reliability And In Solid-State Batteries\n\nOf course, no discussion of automotive solid-state batteries is complete without noting Toyota’s long efforts to make them happen. (Indeed, it sometimes seems like Toyota is waiting for its solid-state batteries before it makes any EV besides the bZ4X SUV). The undisputed leader in Japanese automotive dependability has been working on SSBs for over a decade. However, despite its many battery-related patents, Toyota has shown very few results from its long (and still ongoing) research efforts.\n\nIt’s possible to speculate that Toyota is waiting until its battery is perfected, its factories set up, and the first shipments of SSBs are dispatched before making any big announcements. But as entertaining as such idle thoughts may be, the fact remains that Toyota stands to suffer a PR embarrassment if Honda (or anyone else) beats it to the solid-state finish line.\n\nThe Rest Of The Auto Industry Is Going Solid-State\n\nOf course, Honda and Toyota are nowhere near the only companies dabbling in solid-state batteries. Most of the major companies in the auto industry have also decided to pursue them. It seems like these days, anyone can throw together a battery startup and attract automotive executives with blank checks and partnership offers.\n\nDespite the tight competition, Honda is the only company to announce a solution for dendrites. This gives the company an edge in the solid-state competition. However, given that no one has managed to put a solid-state battery into a production car, that advantage may prove short-lived and ultimately worthless.\n\nThe Long Road To Solid-State Batteries \n\nIf Honda’s own press releases are to be believed, the company is set to completely change EV batteries. It’s difficult to imagine, but the ongoing worries about EV battery lifespans and replacement could become as outdated as cars with choke knobs on the dashboard. Those are some grand promises (even by self-promotion standards), so a bit of skepticism is in order. However, a bit of optimism would not be out of place.\n\nYears (Or Decades) Of Research Does Not Guarantee Success\n\nSolid-state batteries are not the first time the auto industry has spent so long pursuing a technology with so little to show for it; so far. Chrysler famously spent over twenty years trying to make a turbine-powered car, and never got beyond producing a small fleet of test models.\n\nAlthough it was quite impressive when, at a promotional event, company executives showed that the turbine could run on anything by mounting one on a stand and pouring French perfume into it. And of course, one would be remiss not to mention Mazda’s on-and-off-again flirtations with the rotary engine, which has so far only made it into a very few models targeted specifically at rotary engine enthusiasts.\n\nLike so many technologies that seemed exciting at first, solid-state batteries have accrued a lot of enthusiastic press (and a faithful flock of naysayers). But as promising as they seem at this early stage, no technology is proven until it is put to use.\n\nHonda’s Potentially Lucrative Solid-State Future\n\nIt is entirely possible that solid-state batteries may join hydrogen combustion engines among the technologies that started well but sputtered out. However, if they do take off, Honda has some of the most promising ones out there. No one else has managed to make the same extraordinary claims of battery longevity.\n\nThe automaker has a long and profitable history of supplying other companies with engines for all manner of uses that have nothing to do with cars (or any other form of transportation). If Honda succeeds with solid-state batteries, it may be able to take a similar (and similarly lucrative) approach to selling them. And, of course, other car manufacturers may want Honda’s batteries too. If the R&D comes together, Honda’s future is full of money.",

        "title": "7 Ways Your Holiday Decorations Could Damage Your House",
        "authors": "Geoff Williams",
        "date": "2023-12-12",
        "articleBody": "You want to spread merriment and cheer in your neighborhood by putting up holiday decorations, so you’re probably not thinking about how they might damage your home.\n\nNobody’s trying to be a Scrooge and suggest you shouldn’t string up 30,000 holiday lights, if that’s your jam, but the more complex your holiday decorations, the more chance that something could go wrong.\n\nIf you’re decorating your home for the holidays, here are some things to keep in mind to keep your home, your family and your neighbors safe.\n\nHoliday Lights and Fires\n\nHoliday lights can lead to house fires if you overload a circuit. Carefully decorating your home can help make the holidays safer.\n\nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), between 2017-2021, U.S. fire departments responded to an average of 793 home structure fires per year that began with decorations, excluding Christmas trees. These fires caused an annual average of four civilian fire deaths, 33 civilian fire injuries and $14 million in direct property damage.\n\nShortly after Thanksgiving this year, a fire claimed a home in Brunswick, Ohio, likely caused by an \"electrical overload\" due to extension cords in the garage feeding a number of outside lights, the fire chief told the local media. The family was unharmed, but the home was a loss.\n\nPlug holiday lights into surge protectors, recommends Courtney Klosterman, director of communications for Hippo Insurance. \"If you think you're going to overload an outlet, don't. You'll want to plug in those holiday lights in multiple outlets,\" she says.\n\nA few more safety tips for holiday lights:\n\n    Don’t use outdoor holiday lights inside your home. They may look interchangeable, but outdoor lights are designed for cold weather, so the lights generally burn hotter than indoor lights. Putting these hotter lights on your Christmas tree, for example, could ignite a blaze. Likewise, your indoor holiday lights shouldn’t go outside. You likely won't create a fire hazard, but they were designed to be indoors and may not last long if they become frozen or wet.\n    You may want to opt for LED bulbs. You can typically connect more LED light strings together end-to-end on one electrical outlet. If you're putting up traditional holiday light strings, the Electrical Safety Foundation International recommends attaching no more than three light strings together.\n    Consider buying a GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter). That's a type of outlet that detects dangerous ground faults and will switch off the power to prevent people from being shocked. On average, according to the home improvement website Angi, you'll pay $210 to install a GFCI outlet, and they cost between $7 and $25 each.\n    Don’t keep your holiday lights on all night. Your neighbors may not appreciate it. The light pollution also isn’t the greatest for nocturnal animals. But mostly, experts suggest turning them off when you’re going to bed to give your electrical outlets a little rest. It’ll keep your electric bill a little lower as well.\n    Consider hiring an electrician. If you’re really worried about what you may or may not do to your home, but you really want to go all out, it may be worth the expense. Generally, electricians tend to cost around $50 to $100 an hour, according to home services information network Angi.\n\nHoliday Lights and Holes in Your Home\n\nPlanning to hammer in a couple of nails or drill some screws into your siding so you can more easily hang holiday lights? It’s probably best if you don’t.\n\n“We have seen firsthand the damage a small screw puncture that is not sealed correctly can do,” says Niki O’Brien, operations manager with Custom Exteriors, an exterior remodeling company in Berthoud, Colorado.\n\n“When that screw is removed, and occasionally even before it is removed, it leaves an open hole in your home,” O’Brien says. “And while it seems like a very small penetration, water can and does enter the home.”\n\nO’Brien says the company’s workers have seen unsealed screw holes cause interior leaks, water damage, rot and mold.\n\n“It's really a best practice to never penetrate the exterior of your home, and this has become easier than ever with all of the damage-free hooks and fasteners that are available now,” O’Brien says.\nHoliday Lights and Gutters\n\nThis is also where some holiday happy homeowners go wrong, O'Brien says. She says heavy lights can shift the slope of the gutters, leading to damage. But more likely, she says, if you’re going to damage your gutters putting up holiday lights, it’ll be from “careless use of the ladder used to install them, scratching or denting the gutters.”\n\nDave Odom, a home inspector and franchise owner of WIN Home Inspection in Warner Robins, Georgia, agrees that using gutters to hang lights is a good way to help water find its way into your home.\n\n“Gutters are for rain, not for your light show extravaganza,\" Odom says. \"You don’t want to be the cause of the Great Neighborhood Flood of 2023.”\nHoliday Lights and Ladders\n\nIn general, be careful when you place a ladder against the side of your home, says O’Brien. Aside from possibly harming your gutters, you can also scratch paint off the siding.\n\nYou also could fall off the ladder. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, on average, there are about 160 Christmas decorating-related injuries every day. That’s during the holiday season, which the CPSC pinpoints as Nov. 1 to Jan. 31. In 2022, about 14,800 people went to the hospital emergency room due to holiday decorating-related injuries, and over 40% of those visits involved falls, the commission reports.\n\nA well-insured professional handyman might be the person to call to put up your holiday lights, if you’re determined to brighten up your roof and reluctant to climb up a ladder. According to the home services website Thumbtack, a professional handyman can run between $60 to $139 an hour, depending on where you live and the complexity of the job.\n\nIf you do climb that ladder yourself, Odom suggests enlisting a buddy to hold the ladder steady. He also says that the golden ratio for ladder safety is that your ladder should be 1 foot away from the house for every 4 feet you’re going to climb.\nInflatable Holiday Decorations and the Wind\n\nThere don’t seem to be a lot of available statistics for inflatable decorations blowing out of yards and into traffic – but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen to you and somebody driving by your home. If you have a 12-foot tall Santa inflatable in your front yard, you’ll want to tie it down securely. The National Property Inspections website suggests, among other things, testing your inflatable's security by tugging the tethers to make sure it's secure and periodically testing it, in case high winds have loosened them.\n\nSure, your homeowners’ insurance may cover the damage if it does sail away and knock over a neighbor walking his dog, but you’d probably rather not have to file that claim.\nOther Potential Fire Hazards In The Home\n\nKlosterman says it’s fairly common for holiday decorations turn deadly inside the home, too.\n\n“If you’re going to be decorating, it’s really important that you minimize your fire risk, and during the holiday season, it’s pretty common to have candles lit,” Klosterman says.\n\n“You’ll want to pay attention where you’re placing decorations, and that they’re a safe distance from heat sources,” Klosterman adds, warning not only to be wary of candles and decorations but the fireplace as well.\n\n“Cotton stockings are cute until they’re on fire,” Odom says.\n\nIf you’re doing a lot of cooking for a big holiday party, Klosterman points out that the potential for a mishap is there as well.\n\n“It’s a good idea to double check your fire extinguisher and inspect the pressure gauge,” she says.\n\nOf the 360,800 home fires every year, according to the CPSC, cooking fires account for nearly half of these. Thanksgiving Day, however, and not Christmas Day, is when most cooking fires happen.\nPay Special Attention to Your Christmas Tree\n\nAccording to NFPA, between 2017 and 2021, each year, fire departments throughout the United States responded to an average of 150 home fires that started with Christmas trees.\n\nIf you have a fresh tree in your home, especially with holiday lights on it, you’ll want to keep it well hydrated, both Klosterman and Odom say.\n\nKlosterman recommends having a freshly cut tree in water-filled stand you check daily to make sure there’s still water in it.\n\n“Dry trees are basically kindling in disguise,” Odom says. He adds that if you’re on “team artificial,” you still can’t completely relax and assume you’re in the clear. You should make sure that your artificial tree has a fire-resistant label, Odom recommends. “No one wants a tree that doubles as a Roman candle,” he says.\nPutting Up Holiday Decorations the Right Way Will Pay Off\n\nSafely decorating a home for the holidays can be a lot of work. But the holidays are, in many ways, all about creating memories, and if your holiday decorations end up catching one of your hedges on fire, you’re going to have some lasting memories you didn’t bargain for.",

        "articleBody": "The vital statistics of Israel and the Palestinian territories show deep disparities in a region now further ravaged by war.\n\nLife in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been upended since an Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel by the terrorist group Hamas, which killed more than 1,000 people and sparked a counteroffensive by the Israeli military in Gaza that has killed thousands more.\n\nThe region that today is home to both Israelis and Palestinians has been rife with conflict along ethnic and other lines for decades, and events throughout its complicated history have contributed to disparate qualities of life. Data points help tell the story of the people who live in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, and what their life was like before the current war.\n\nAge\n\nThe population density of Gaza rivals that of America’s largest cities, with more than 2 million people living on a roughly 140-square-mile strip of land. About 40% of Gaza’s population is 14 years old or younger and the territory’s median age was just 18 in 2020, making Gaza home to one of the world’s 20 youngest populations, based on figures from the CIA’s World Factbook.\n\nThe West Bank’s median age was also low, at 21.9 years, ranking it among the 50 youngest populations based on World Factbook data. Relatively few people in the Palestinian territories are in their senior years, as estimates indicate people at least 65 years old make up less than 3% of Gaza’s population and about 4% of the West Bank’s population. Large shares of the population in both Gaza and the West Bank are Palestinian refugees.\n\nIn Israel, an estimated 12.4% of the population is 65 or older, and the country’s median age of 30.4 years was roughly on par with the global median age of 31.\n\nIsraeli and Palestinian Populations by Age\n\nThese five-year age groups for 2023 illustrate the much younger population in Palestinian territories.\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nIsrael ranks among the top 10 countries worldwide for life expectancy, with an estimated average life expectancy of 83.5 years.\n\nMeanwhile, people born in Gaza today can expect to live for 75.7 years, and in the West Bank, 76.6 years. While both territories' estimates are lower than Israel’s, life expectancy in each is projected to be longer than the world’s mark of 70.5 years.\n\nReligion and Ethnicity\n\nThe vast majority of people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are Muslims who predominantly practice Sunni Islam, though hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis have settled in the West Bank. And while Jewish people make up the majority of the population in Israel (74%), Muslims account for about 1 in 5 people there (18%).\n\nThe stats are similar for ethnic groups: Palestinian Arabs are the dominant group in both Gaza and the West Bank, while about 21% of the Israeli population is Arab. The 120-member Knesset – Israel’s unicameral legislative body – featured its lowest number of Arab representatives (10) in two decades when newly elected members were sworn in a year ago.\n\nWar in Israel and Gaza\n\nPoverty and Unemployment\n\nSince Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel – supported by Egypt – has blockaded the territory and tightly controls the movement of people and goods in and out.\n\nAn International Monetary Fund report says more than 60% of Gazans recently lived in poverty, while the West Bank’s share was 19%. Gaza’s unemployment rate was 44% at the end of 2022, according to the report.\n\nMany of the best jobs available to Gazans are located across the border in Israel and require highly coveted work permits issued by the Israeli government. Israel detained at least some permitted workers and deported thousands in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.",

According to the actor, who rose to stardom for his role as a Confederacy-worshipping bootlegger in the ‘80s-era TV series The Dukes of Hazzard, he’s experienced bias in court and has struggled to find work, all due to his far-right views. Now Schneider is under a new level of scrutiny after publishing a tweet—since deleted—that many view as a threat against President Joe Biden.\n\nSchneider was revealed to be the man behind the doughnut mask on the Fox singing competition The Masked Singer Wednesday, where he placed second behind singer NE-YO. “I’m a pretty strong guy, but I’m also a very emotional guy,” the actor told People the next day. “Being out there on that stage dressed like a doughnut, singing some of the greatest songs ever written, and having people respond to the songs and the performance with no notion that it was me, really, really helped John Schneider.”\n\nWhat likely didn’t help John Schneider was a tweet he posted that same day. As first noted by Deadline, Schneider responded to a tweet from Biden about presidential rival Donald Trump by saying (sic throughout) “Mr. President, I believe you are guilty of treason and should be public hung.

        "articleBody": "“The Iron Claw” revolves around the Von Erich family, a dynasty of professional wrestlers who made history in the intensely competitive sport in the early 1980s. Based on a true story, the A24 drama features Von Erich brothers Kevin (Zac Efron), David (Harris Dickinson), Kerry (Jeremy Allen White) and Mike (Stanley Simons). One brother, however, was omitted from the film altogether: Chris Von Erich.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, “Iron Claw” filmmaker Sean Durkin explained why he decided not to include the youngest Von Erich, who also wrestled but struggled to match his brothers’ success due to his asthma and brittle bone condition. He died by suicide in 1991 at age 21. \n\n “There was a repetition to it, and it was one more tragedy that the film couldn’t really withstand,” Durkin said of a version that included all the brothers. “I honestly don’t know if it would have gotten made.”\n\nThe pro-wrestling family was plagued with a series of tragedies that became known as the “Von Erich curse”: David died suddenly in 1984 at age 25, and both Mike and Kerry died by suicide in 1987 and 1993 respectively. These deaths are seen through the eyes of Kevin, the sole surviving Von Erich brother, in “The Iron Claw.”\n\n“Chris was in the script for five years,” Durkin said, adding that removing Chris from the final version was “an impossible choice” that he fought against for a while.\n\nDurkin also decided not to contact Kevin until he finished writing his script.\n\n“When you’re trying to get a film made, you have to separate it at some point and say, ‘These are characters on a page, and this is a film, and there’s no way you’re going to fully capture the life of a person in a film,’” Durkin explained. “You have to make difficult choices to try and get to something truthful or representative or emotional that reflects the core of the journey you’re choosing to tell within this family.”\n\n“The Iron Claw” is currently in theaters.",

        "authors": "Todd Spangler",

        "articleBody": "Lawyers for Ozy Media, the defunct media and entertainment company founded by Carlos Watson, allege in a new lawsuit that Ben Smith, BuzzFeed and Semafor (the media startup co-founded by Smith in 2022) misappropriated Ozy’s trade secrets “for their own benefit.”\n\nThe suit additionally alleges that BuzzFeed breached a nondisclosure agreement it entered into with Ozy in 2019 as part of its efforts to buy the company. Lawyers representing Ozy Media allege that Smith, former BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief and New York Times media columnist who is currently editor-in-chief of Semafor, wrote “a series of hit pieces” about Ozy Media but that he did not disclose “his central role in BuzzFeed’s efforts to buy Ozy two years earlier” while he was at BuzzFeed. \n\n Reps for BuzzFeed and Semafor declined to comment. Smith did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeks unspecified monetary damages and that Smith and Semafor be “restrained and enjoined from misappropriating, disclosing or using Ozy’s Confidential Information and trade secrets.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Smith “was given unfettered access to Ozy’s trade secrets during the BuzzFeed acquisition process” in September 2019, when BuzzFeed was exploring a deal to buy Ozy Media that it ultimately abandoned. That included “non-public information” related to “the actual or anticipated business and/or products, research or development” of Ozy, such as marketing, finance and other business materials, as well as information on Ozy’s customers.\n\nLawyers for Ozy Media accused Smith of copying Ozy’s business model to launch Semafor.\n\n“After BuzzFeed went public and having seen Ozy’s playbook for launching, operating and generating revenue from a multiplatform media company during BuzzFeed’s attempt to buy Ozy, Ben Smith and his co-founder announced the creation of their own media company, Semafor — a spitting image of Ozy,” Dustin Pusch, a partner at Meier Watkins Phillips Pusch, the law firm representing Ozy, said in a statement\n\nA story by Smith published Sept. 26, 2021, in the New York Times reported that Ozy Media falsified audience metrics and that COO Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive on a call with prospective investor Goldman Sachs.\n\nRegarding the Times story, the lawsuit claims, “Watson was shocked that Ben Smith would even report on Ozy at all given the unprecedented access to Ozy’s trade secrets he had at BuzzFeed — and his strict obligations under the Mutual NDA.”\n\nIn March 2023, Ozy Media shut down after Watson was arrested and indicted on federal fraud charges the previous month. On Feb. 23, Watson was arrested in Manhattan and charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in what the Justice Department alleged was a scheme to defraud Ozy’s investors and lenders. Watson was also charged with “aggravated identity theft” for his role in the impersonation of “multiple media company executives” in communications with Ozy’s lenders and prospective investors in furtherance of the fraud schemes, federal prosecutors said.\n\nWatson, as part of a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) following his arrest and indictment, said he “will fight these charges with everything I have, and I look forward to my day in court.” He also wrote, “I am deeply disappointed by the government’s actions yesterday. I am not now and never have been a ‘con man.’ I am and have been, a hard-working entrepreneur who has helped build a special company from scratch.” He continued, “I’m not saying I haven’t made mistakes — I have. But it’s fair to ask, why I’ve been singled out? Ozy is a real and valuable company that was built through an enormous amount of hard work and sacrifice.”\n\nWatson’s “con man” reference was regarding the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern District of New York’s Feb. 23 press release about the indictment. Watson’s lawyers took issue with the U.S. Attorney’s description of him as a “con man” and Ozy Media as a “criminal organization,” among other things. In a request to the judge overseeing the case, Watson’s legal team asked the government to remove such “prejudicial language.” In a response filed Nov. 6, Judge Eric Komitee agreed with many of those contentions; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern District of New York removed the “con man” and “criminal organization” from the press release in a Nov. 16 update.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of Ozy Media, which Watson had launched in 2013, claimed that prior to Smith’s reports in the New York Times, “Ozy was a successful and thriving majority Black-owned multiplatform brand with five premium subscription newsletters, 12 TV shows, 10 podcasts, a unique awards program and a flagship events business anchored by Ozy Fest.”",

        "articleBody": "Dad, do you know what the Algerian War and alcohol have in common? I've found three things: silence, taboo and shame.” That’s how French-Algerian artist Yasmine Yahiatene opens her solo show La Fracture (The Fracture), about her Algerian roots.\n\nYahiatene was born and raised in France by Algerian parents, who came to live in the country that formerly colonised their land of origin during the Algerian War of Independence. In this bitter conflict, which lasted from 1954 to 1962, France was accused of horrific war crimes, including the use of torture and chemical warfare.\n\nAbout 40 percent of Algeria’s population was displaced. Some people lived in refugee camps; others followed friends and relatives who had relocated to France during the colonial period. The violence of the conflict has left its mark on those who experienced it, and many survivors still struggle to make sense of what happened or open up about it.\n\nIn the show, Yahiatene delves into her complex and personal family history to the sound of music from the Algerian singer-songwriter Idir and the rapper Soolking. She opens up about her father’s alcoholism and how he’s never told her about his past and his country, but also about their shared love for football and Zinedine Zidane. \n\nI wound up seeing her performance twice. As a Belgian-Algerian, I identified deeply with it. The found footage she shows of her family reminded me so much of my own. She also plays a clip of Zidane's famous double against Brazil in the ‘98 World Cup and then runs euphorically across the stage. I remember this moment very well, too. I remember how proud and happy my whole family was – we even called up my grandma and auntie in Algeria.\n\nI also know what it’s like to have a father who doesn't talk much. After seeing her play for the first time, I remember thinking to myself, ‘Actually, we’re all the same; we're all just as clueless.’\n\nWhen I consider that thought more closely, there's some truth in it – in the sense that our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents who lived through colonisation and the war all have some key things in common. (Trauma, mainly.)\n\nFor Yahiatene, creating this show was healing. It let her to open up about topics that had always been taboo, like her father's alcoholism. It also helped her decolonise her own personal history and reconnect with her origins. \n\n“My relationship with Algeria is non-existent, apart from my face and name,” she says as I interview her on stage at one of her performances. “This show has allowed me to reconnect with that part of myself. It meant understanding that I'm not white, blonde with blue eyes. It's all new to me!”\n\nMany people of colour growing up in white spaces don’t realise they’re not white until a mirror is held up to them and makes them different. I remember realising it for the first time when I was still very young, in primary school, when a white classmate said in front of the whole class that my Moroccan friend and I smelled the same. That left a mark on me, even if I was too young to understand why. Of course, as you grow up, you get a lot more frequent, harsher and alienating comments.\n\nFor Yahiatene, things clicked much later. “When I was looking for a flat, I sent around the same email as a friend, except our names were different,” she explains. “He kept getting replies and I didn't. That was it. It's fairly common, unfortunately.”\n\nThis realisation marked the start of a deeper period of questioning for Yahiatene. She realised that decolonisation doesn't only happen physically – like when the French left Algeria – but also mentally. “Decolonisation is something you have to work on,” she says. “Whether you’re a person of colour or not, when you're born in Europe, you grow up thinking that this is the only way to do things. But more and more thinkers and artists tell us it doesn't have to be that way.”\n\nShe’s aware of the juxtaposition at play: While Yahiatene looks to dismantle the effect of colonialism on her identity, her parents have been down the exact opposite path, giving up their personal history to integrate and fit in. “[Integration] is giving up a part of yourself to fit in with the dominant country,” she says. “That's what we - and I - are putting into question today.”\n\nIntegration has consequences for the people who experience it themselves, but also for their descendants. “There’s a reason why I can't speak Arabic but speak French perfectly,” Yahiatene says. It’s something I’ve also always felt ashamed of.\n\nIn his book L'arabe pour tous - Pourquoi ma langue est taboue en France (Arabic for everyone - Why my language is taboo in France), author and journalist Nabil Wakim explains in detail why Arab-speaking immigrant parents are less likely to teach Arabic to their children, compared with people who speak other, less stigmatised languages. Once again, Islamophobia and racism are the core of the problem.\n\nWakim also shared the shame of not speaking the language of his origins and not being able to pass it on to his children. But in her play, Yahiatene wants to reclaim this missed heritage. “I think it's important to reclaim the part of ourselves that was stolen from us by colonisation without feeling bad about it,” she says. “This place of not knowing yourself has a right to exist. Many of us are in this situation!”\n\nAccording to Yahiatene, this process of reclaiming is not just about learning, but about listening to yourself. \"I don’t know much about history, dates or facts; I’ve seen the same documentaries you have,” she says. “But I act with my gut more than with my brain.”\n\nDuring the play, Yahiatene asks her dad questions. “Why does Grandma have tattoos on her face? Why can't I speak Arabic? Why don't you tell me what happened in Algeria? Why can't I stop myself when I drink?” – questions that speak of heaviness and oppressing silences. Her mother’s side of the story is not included because Yahiatene is currently developing another show about her.\n\nThe question of intergenerational trauma is particularly relevant for Yahiatene, as she is about the same age as her father was when she was born. “I question my relationship [with alcohol] and how I can avoid making the same mistakes,” she says. “I’m trying to face this issue and solve it, or at least make it less taboo. Bringing it up on stage is a first step. It might help people to talk about it after the show – or maybe not.”\n\nFootball also plays an important role in La Fracture, both for personal and political reasons. When you first enter the performance space, you find Yahiatene wearing the blue strip of the French national team - number 10 like Zidane, of course - and drawing a football pitch on the floor of the stage with a white marker.\n\nYahiatene used to play football a lot growing up. Just like many in the Algerian diaspora, she was deeply marked by Zidane's legendary status. “I was living in the south of France at the time, and there must have been only two Arabs in my school,” she said. “The day after the final, we both went to school chests out, going: ‘Yeah, yeah, Zidane!’ It was a really powerful moment for us and for the whole community.”\n\nZidane has also paid the price of integration, Yahiatene says. When you think about it, the simple fact that he wears the French jersey but makes Algerians so proud is disconcerting. \"When Zidane scores, he scores for France, and we're happy that he's French,” she adds.\n\nBut the myth of the beauty of diversity Zidane personified took a major hit when he famously headbutted Italy’s Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final. “That showed the whole problem with the idea of the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ Arab,” Yahiatene says.\n\nBeyond the fact that it’s touched audiences, La Fracture also made Yahiatene’s family proud and helped them become closer. “A lot of people in my family saw it and that was quite beautiful,” she says. “In families like mine, we don't talk. My show helped to get things out that were a bit dead inside, but without talking about it.”\n\nHer mother, aunts and grandmother returned to Algeria last year for the first time in 40 years. “They went back to their village, where my mother was born, and it was great to experience that from a distance,” she explains. “I like to think that it was thanks to the show.”\n\nI attended Yahiatene's performance on Oct. 18, when the latest bombardment of Gaza by Israel had begun. Yahiatene and her team decided to add a statement at the end of the show, drawing a parallel between Algeria and Palestine. Yahiatene’s show is “profoundly anti-colonial,” she says. “We condemn and will condemn all forms of colonisation past, present and future.”\n\nIt’s a sad correlation that history repeats itself, just like trauma.",

        "articleBody": "St. Louis, Missouri police crashed into a gay bar and then beat and arrested its owner early on Monday morning and charged him with felony assault, according to a lawyer representing the owner. \n\nVideo released by attorney Javad Khazaeli shows a police SUV driving down a street at high speeds and then swerving into Bar:PM at around 12:30 a.m. Monday. Police initially said they swerved to miss a parked car. The video shows a parked car on the side of the road that is not the SUV’s path. \n\nAfter the crash, police handcuffed one of the bar’s owners James Pence and then arrested his husband and co-owner Chad Morris, charging him with felony assault and resisting arrest. One of the cops on scene, John Pierce, said in a probable cause statement that he was investigating the car accident when Morris refused to comply with his requests to back up, screamed obscenities, and hit him.\n\n“The defendant struck me hard in the chest with an open hand, causing me to temporarily lose my balance,” Pierce alleged. He said Morris then tried to flee into a gangway when he told him he was under arrest and “attempted to strike me with the gate.” \n\nMorris was detained for 36 hours, but prosecutors have since downgraded his assault charge to a misdemenour assault and he was released Tuesday morning on his own recognizance. Morris had scratches on his face and a black eye when he was released . \n\n“I'm really glad to be out and it's been an emotional time,” he told reporters as he left the St. Louis City Justice Center. \n\nKhazaeli showed VICE News portions of a bystander video of the aftermath of the crash, which appears to dispute police’s version of events. \n\nSt. Louis police did not respond to VICE News’ request for comment. \n\nThe video shows an officer asking Pence for his identification after the crash, to which Pence responds, “you cannot card me.” The officer tells Pence to “stop yelling” and also tells the bystander taking the video, “He’s not going to yell at me, that’s causing a disturbance.” Police handcuff Pence. \n\n“Keep interfering, you’ll be in handcuffs too, clown,” the officer tells the bystander. \n\nThe video also shows Morris asking police why they’re handcuffing his husband. Pierce alleged Morris hit him before going into the gangway, causing him to lose his balance. The video does not show that happening. \n\nThe video doesn’t show what happened in the gangway, which is when Morris alleged police hit him. \n\n“This motherfucker in the black beanie punched me in the fucking face,” he says, referring to the same officer who called the bystander a “clown.” \n\nThen police arrest Morris and load him into their van. \n\nKhazaeli said the prosecutor’s office still hasn’t requested any of the footage available. He said they will either have to drop the misdemeanour assault charge or his client will go to trial. \n\n“His whole body was sore and he had bruises in other parts of his body,” Khazaeli said. \n\n“This is all in the context of my guys doing nothing wrong and somebody slamming a car through their business.”\n\nHe said it’s not clear if St. Louis police have done anything about the two officers involved in the crash, nor if the officers were given a breathalyser or drug tested. According to the Riverfront Times, the driver is a 32-year-old probationary officer who’s been with St. Louis police for less than a year. \n\n“If this had been a few hours earlier when the bar was open, somebody would have died,” Khazaeli said.",

Celebrating her forthcoming series Expats – which she helmed alongside director Lulu Wang – the ever-stylish star hit the red carpet in Sydney, Australia looking like a Greek sculpture come to life.\n\nKidman pulled out all the stops to mark the occasion, tapping Fendi’s Kim Jones for help in bringing her goddess-like vision to fruition. Styled by Jason Bolden, the actor wore a look from Fendi’s autumn/winter 2023 couture collection. The dress was simple but breathtaking, a strapless nude column with a draped bodice and a thigh-high slit. (Taking full advantage of the dress, Kidman struck a leggy pose á là Angelina Jolie.)\n\nWhile Jones sent a model down the runway with a nude polo-neck under the dress, Kidman decided to forgo the extra layer. She kept the rest of her look simple, wearing matching pointy-toe pumps in suede.\n\nHer accessories – a chunky gold ring, hoop earrings and a thick bangle around the forearm – amped up the Greek goddess vibe. While the tiny, rectangular gold clutch she carried could pass for Pandora’s Box. What with all that, and the hair piled atop her head and dangling in red curls, you’d swear Kidman was a modern-day resident of Mount Olympus.",

        "articleBody": "Thanks to the last series of The Crown, all eyes have been on the wardrobe worn by Princess Diana in the final summer before her death in August 1997: the confident and uncompromising neon and leopard print Versace swimsuits for sojourns to Saint-Tropez, the charity event-ready roster of smart shift dresses by longtime favourite Catherine Walker, and the dressed-down DNA of her post-workout chinos and loafers.\n\nBut it’s the ostentation of the ’80s that drew bidders to a recent lot at Julien’s Auctions’ “Hollywood Legends” sale in Beverly Hills, where a shoulder-padded, sparkling and star-embroidered Azagury evening dress sold on Sunday for £904,262. Princess Diana first wore the dress in 1985 to join her then husband Prince Charles at a dinner at Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and again a year later to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The gown by the London-based, Moroccan-born designer – complete with voluminous organza skirt, drop-waist bow and hand-sewn metallic detailing – fetched the largest sum of any dress worn by the Princess to be sold at auction, selling for 11 times the original estimated value.\n\nWhen it comes to Diana’s wardrobe, 2023 has been a year of six-figure sales. Back in September, a Sotheby’s auction saw the intarsia-knit black sheep jumper by British brand Warm & Wonderful – worn by a 19-year-old Diana in 1981 to watch Prince Charles play polo – sell for £886,347. The sweater, listed with an estimate of around £63,000, instantly became the most expensive knit sold at auction (followed by the £260,000 unwashed and cigarette-burnt khaki cardigan Kurt Cobain wore for a Nirvana MTV Unplugged concert). Back in January, Kim Kardashian also snapped up a piece from the late Princess of Wales’s wardrobe: the amethyst-twinkling Attallah Cross, made by royal jeweller Garrard in 1920. The piece sold at Sotheby’s for £160,000.",

        "title": "10 Eco-Friendly Ways To Get Rid Of Your Christmas Tree",
        "authors": "Simone M. Scully",
        "date": "2023-12-11",
        "articleBody": "Every year, Americans buy 25 to 30 million real Christmas trees to decorate their homes over the holidays, according to the National Christmas Tree Association. But that's not bad news. Most experts agree that buying a real tree is the more eco-friendly option, because as trees grow, they clean the air and provide habitats for wildlife. Christmas trees are also biodegradable and recyclable, which means that if they are disposed of properly, they can give back to the environment long after the holiday season is over. The key is to make sure that they don’t end up in landfills.\n\nUnfortunately, Christmas trees don’t make good firewood because the chemical creosote tends to build up in the wood. This can cause them to burn extremely hot and can send dangerous sparks flying. However, there are lots of other ways that you can get rid of your tree in an eco-friendly way.\n\n1. Re-Plant It.\n\nIf you bought a Christmas tree with a root ball this year and you have a backyard with room for a new tree, the best thing you can do is replant it as soon as you can after the holiday so that it can continue to grow and provide a home again for backyard wildlife. Many kinds of Christmas trees, such as the Norwegian Spruce and Fraser Fir, are pretty resilient, so they’ll likely recover quickly even if their branches have already started to droop. \n\n2. Turn the Whole Thing into a Bird Feeder.\n\nEven if you didn’t buy a tree with roots, you can still use it to help feed backyard birds. Just stick it outside for the winter and string it with popcorn, cranberries, stale bread, dried fruit or even whole sunflower heads. You’ll have chickadees, sparrows, cardinals and other backyard birds eating from there in no time. Plus, the branches will provide some shelter for the birds from the cold weather while they snack.\n\n3. Create a Stump Bird Feeder.\n\nDon’t want a whole dying Christmas tree just hanging out in your yard all winter long, but still want to feed the birds? Cut up the trunk into stumps and turn the stumps into bird resting places and mini, natural bird feeders. You can leave some seeds on top of the stumps and, if you remember to turn the stump over every day to reveal worms and insects underneath it, the birds will love you.\n\n4. Use Branches In Your Garden.\n\nCut Christmas tree branches from your tree, remove all the needles, trim the branches down, and use them as support sticks for the legume shoots in your garden. Legumes are “thigmotropic,” which means that they grow in a particular direction when they come into contact with an object and respond to it. They often need supports or frames when growing so that they can climb upwards toward light. Christmas tree branches are perfect for this job because they have lots of texture, knobs and twigs for peas and beans to latch on to as they grow.\n\n5. Protect Your Flower Beds from Winter Freezes.\n\nCut whole evergreen boughs from your tree before they lose their needles, and place the boughs on your perennial flower beds to protect your dormant flowers from freezing weather. This will help the soil maintain a more steady temperature and will help protect the plants so that they will be more healthy next spring.\n\n6. Make a Bee House.\n\nOrchard mason bees are great pollinators and they rarely sting, but they don’t live in nests like other bees, nor do they drill holes themselves. Instead, they live in the existing holes that they find in wood. So, to make a home for them, cut parts of your tree into small logs — or blocks — then drill holes about 3 to 5 inches deep into the wood. (Just be sure not to drill your hole all the way through). Then scatter the prospective bee “houses” throughout your yard and watch your new neighbors settle in.\n\n7. Make Your Home Smell Like Pine.\n\nGather up all the pine needles on your living room floor or remove the needles from your Christmas tree branches, break them up slightly (into halves will work fine), then boil them in water on your stove. Once the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer for a bit. This will fill your home with the scent of pine and it will be the perfect way to say goodbye to the holiday season. You can throw in some other ingredients too, like cinnamon or cranberries, if you want to customize and enhance the scent.\n\n8. Get Crafty.\n\nThere are lots of rustic decorations and crafts that you can make from a leftover Christmas tree trunk — and it can even give you a head start on next year’s holiday gifts. For example, you can cut the trunk into thin slices to make coasters, ornaments or snowmen decorations. You can also make little reindeer decorations with pieces of the trunk and some twigs from the branches.\n\n9. Donate It To a Recycling Center.\n\nLook for a local community program in your area where your tree can be recycled and put to good use. In some municipalities, Christmas trees are sunk into artificial lakes to create temporary shelters for fish. In other places, such as in Louisiana, donated trees have been used to help stabilize lake and river coastlines by creating sand and soil erosion barriers. Some zoos accept donated trees and allow animals to play with them.\n\n10. Mulch It.\n\nIf you have your own wood-chipper, you can chip most of your tree and turn it into mulch — a decorative landscaping material that is biodegradable, making it very environmentally-friendly. But don’t worry if you don’t have your own wood-chipper (most of us don’t): lots of towns and communities have tree-cycling programs where they will chip the tree for you and use the wood chips as mulch for gardens, flower beds or park trails. Sometimes, they’ll give you a bag to take home for your yard in exchange for your donation. Check your local department of public works for information and locations where you can take your tree.",

        "articleBody": "At a Glance\n\n    The magnitude 5.9 quake has killed at least 134 people.\n    Another 900 people have been injured.\n    Survivors are in temporary shelters amid a frigid cold snap.\n\nSurrounded by destruction, survivors of an earthquake mourned the dead and endured a frigid cold in temporary shelters Wednesday, unsure how to rebuild their lives in the remote mountains of northwest China.\n\n“Look at this,” said Han Zhongmin, retrieving some belongings with his wife from the ruins of their house, built six years ago in Yangwa village. \"My house turned into this overnight.”\n\nHouses caved in and crumbled in a Monday night earthquake that killed at least 134 people and injured more than 900 others. Most of the casualties were in Gansu province and the rest in the neighboring province of Qinghai.\n\nIn the predawn darkness, Ma Lianqiang stood next to the body of his deceased wife wrapped in blankets in a tent-like temporary shelter lit by a single overhead light. His wife was hit and buried by debris in her mother’s house, where she had gone to stay because she was ill.\n\nMa and other members of his extended family survived despite extensive damage to their house in Yangwa, which is in Gansu province. His father pulled Ma’s son, whose back was slightly injured, out of the rubble. His uncle said they heard the earthquake and then the house started collapsing.\n\n“We crawled out in fear,” the uncle, Ma Chengming, said.\n\nNearly 15,000 homes collapsed in Gansu and more than 87,000 people have been resettled, provincial officials said at a Wednesday news conference. Many spent the night in shelters set up in the area as temperatures plunged well below freezing.\n\nTo the north, searchers in Qinghai were looking for 13 people missing in an area where landslides inundated two villages, partially burying homes. Excavators dug at the sea of soil, and rescue workers tried to break into some buried houses from the rooftops.\n\nThe number missing was down from 16 earlier Wednesday. The death toll in the province had gone up again Wednesday afternoon according to a CCTV report.\n\nGansu officials said their search and rescue effort had basically been completed by mid-afternoon Tuesday. The province’s death toll remained at 113 and the number of injured rose to 782. Together with 198 in Qinghai, that brought the total injured close to 1,000.\n\nVillagers in Yangwa bundled up against the cold and ate instant noodle soup being served in a tent of translucent green plastic sheeting. Han Fujun said more immediate concerns were on his mind than what to do about his destroyed home.\n\n“It’s still a problem to get enough to eat and stay warm,” he said inside the makeshift shelter.\n\nThe earthquake struck in a poor, rural area that is on the the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and populated by several predominantly Muslim ethnic groups. It is about 800 miles southwest of Beijing, the Chinese capital.\n\nPeople wept as the body of Ma Lianqiang’s wife, covered with a carpet, was carried away on what looked like a metal bed frame after Muslim funeral rites held outdoors.\n\nThe death toll was the highest from an earthquake in China in nine years. Experts blamed the high toll on several factors, including the shallow depth of the quake and the lower quality construction in the poor region.\n\n“Now our lives are what matters a lot,” Yangwa resident Ma Bajin said. “If we are not here, then there’s no such thing as survival.”",

        "articleBody": "When it rains, it pours. Here are our picks for cold, wet days—plus expert tips on deciphering product specs.\n\nEvery time I slip on a rain jacket, I give thanks that we no longer have to wrap ourselves in thick, smelly sealskin to stay dry. Advances in weatherproof textiles and apparel design mean that rain jackets today are more comfortable and watertight than ever. But depending on the climate and your level of activity, sorting through different styles, technologies, and waterproof ratings can be confusing.\n\nEvery year, I test around 10 to 12 rain jackets through the soggy Pacific Northwest winter. I hike, bike, run, and walk my dog; sometimes I stand in the shower with my clothes on when the weather isn’t cooperating. I also got advice from Amber Williams, a consumer science educator and lecturer in textile science and pattern making at Utah State University’s Outdoor Product Design program. These are our favorite rain jackets.\n\nIf you’re tight on cash, check out our guide to the Best Cold Weather Gear for Under $100. Or you can always reapply waterproofing agents to your beloved old jacket.\n\nUpdated Decemberr 2023: We added the Stutterheim Stockholm, the Showers Pass Cloudburst, and a new pick for rain pants and eliminated older or out-of-stock picks. We also updated links and pricing throughout.\nTable of Contents\n\n    Best Everyday Rain Jacket\n    Best Rain Jacket for Running\n    Best Rain Jacket for Biking\n    Best Rain Jacket for Hiking\n    Best Affordable Rain Jacket\n    Best Rain Pants\n    Honorable Mentions\n    Understanding Rain Jacket Tech\n\nBest Everyday Rain Jacket\n\nSince the 1960s, most effective modern rainwear has relied upon the use of carcinogenic perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Modern durable water repellents (DWRs) use PFCs in the manufacturing process, which then migrate from your clothing into soil and streams as you tromp around outside.\n\nToday, many companies are manufacturing and using PFC-free DWRs. But I’d argue that if all you need is a regular everyday jacket, you can't go wrong with a classic rubber raincoat. Technical rain jacket manufacturers tend to shy away from polyurethane, because it's, well, rubbery. But the material is durable, long-lasting, windproof, and waterproof, and it's also PFC-free! I also prefer rubber rain jackets in damp coastal climates, such as the Pacific Northwest—breathability is less of a sticking point with me when the air is already humid.\n\nI've tried many jackets in this category. However, Stutterheim makes the only jacket that I went back and bought (on sale) with my own money. This fall, I've worn the Stockholm every day through several atmospheric rivers soaking the Portland area. The outer covering is made from 100 percent rubberized PVC, with a comfortable cotton and polyester lining.\n\nIt's true to size and roomy enough to layer a down vest under it. It has double-welded seams, and the hood is capacious enough for a baseball cap or a large beanie. I also like the buttons; when I'm just throwing on a jacket to walk the dog, it's faster than either worrying about seam-sealed zippers or getting a zipper caught in a storm flap. Of course, it's a basic slicker, and it's not great for every activity—sometimes I pop a button biking my kids to school. But I now have two. If you also live in a rainy climate and are sick of re-waterproofing your rain jacket every season, I would suggest getting one of these.\n\n? Alternatives: Many companies make long-lasting rubberized slickers. If the price of the Stockholm makes you gag, Rain's waterproof jacket ($125) is very similar but at a much lower price point. Baxter Woods' option has a recycled polyster lining.\n\nBest Rain Jacket for Running\n\nMy requirements for a running rain jacket are much different than for an everyday one. I'm sweating, so I'm already a little damp to begin with, and I don't care as much if the jacket is a little more permeable. However, I want it to fit well, not chafe or rustle annoyingly, and have good ventilation so I don't become clammy when I'm working out.\n\nShowers Pass is an Oregon-based company that originally made cycling clothes and only recently branched into running clothes. The company took a lot of learnings about breathability and fit from cycling into designing running clothes. This year, it released a hoodie version ($239) of the Cloudburst jacket that I've owned for several years. I thought I would like a hooded version, but no—I'm usually wearing a brimmed baseball cap to keep the rain out of my eyes, and the hood stays bunched up around my neck. So I'm going to keep recommending the unhooded version, which is cheaper, anyway.\n\nIt's just the best rain jacket for running that I've worn. Despite having a 10.2K waterproof rating, the fabric is soft, stretchy, and breathable, and the cut is tidy and trim. I've worn it for several hours while running in the rain, and water continues to bead up on the surface without becoming unpleasantly clammy underneath. As you heat up, you can vent by opening the mesh pockets—so much more preferable to pit zips, which can chafe. Also, I appreciate that unlike many other running jackets. the Cloudburst is made in hi-viz colors and with reflective detailing.\n\n? Alternatives: The classic running jacket is the Patagonia Houdini ($109), which is super simple and packs down incredibly small. The company recently switched to a PFC-free DWR. The Houdini is stylish, simple, and classic, and everyone has one. However, it rustles, it's not terribly breathable, and I feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag. I've tried the North Face's Futurelight rain jackets ($290), which are made from North Face's spider-woven Futurelight fabric, and they held up when I was running in the snow. I haven't noticed any issues so far, but some reviews seem to suggest that the material is not that durable long-term.\n\nI also like Lululemon's Cross Chill ($198), which has a very slim fit and is made from nylon and Lycra with a polyester lining; however, it's just not quite as soft or stretchy as the Showers Pass jacket. All runners sweat, but our tolerance for cold and damp differs (my husband doesn't even wear a rain jacket!), so your options are a little more flexible. I've tried a number of PFC-free options that are made from alternative materials. For example, Smartwool’s Merino Anorak ($130) uses a PFC-free DWR; it doesn't pack down very small, though.\n\nBest Rain Jacket for Biking\n\nAs much time as I spend in the rain, I never get quite as soaked as I do when ebiking my two children to and from school. If you’re a dedicated cyclist who spends hours training with a Peloton, you will probably be better off with a lightweight, high-visibility jacket that can stretch as you move and vent heat. However, if you’re an everyday bike commuter, you likely want a less technical jacket.\n\nCleverhood is an independent, Rhode Island-based company, and its signature garment is the biking-friendly Rain Cape. However, the anorak is my favorite. Like the cape, it’s cut very generously to allow for a flannel shirt and a small down jacket underneath. It’s cut longer in the back to cover my tail as I’m riding. It also has a protected flap under the front zip so I don’t get wet when I open it up, and an enormous kangaroo pocket that’s handy for stowing my shell gloves, masks, and even bike locks in a pinch.\n\nI also like that the hood is designed to fit under my helmet, which means I can move my head and neck around a little more easily. I do have to note, though, that I now have several Cleverhood jackets and have managed to bust the zipper on one of them, so long-term durability might be an issue.\n\n? Alternative: If you bike a lot on the road, then you probably want a stretchy, high-visibility cycling jacket. Showers Pass is also great for this, and the Cloudburst jacket can also be worn cycling (without a hood, as you will probably be wearing a helmet).\n\nBest Rain Jacket for Hiking\n\nI really didn't believe that Eddie Bauer’s First Ascent line would work. Not because of its specs—it’s a standard high-end three-layer jacket, seam-sealed, with waterproof zips and StormRepel Super DWR (Eddie Bauer’s longest-lasting DWR). The reason I did not believe it would work was because the jacket itself was improbably light, flexible, soft, and stretchy.\n\nEddie Bauer’s First Ascent line was designed with backpacking and climbing in mind—sports where you might face exposure for long periods of time and it’s important to stay dry. By the time I got my hands on a tester, the only ones available were in men’s sizes. But even then, I didn’t mind. It quickly became my favorite jacket for any athletic activity (bar running), just because it was so easy to wear. It kept me dry, even through pelting rainstorms that left my pants soaked after less than five minutes. As a bonus, it stretched over several insulating layers.\n\n? Great alternatives: The terrible truth is that if you're going to be exposed for multiple hours, you are probably not going to be able to rely on a PFC-free DWR to keep hypothermia at bay. Arc'teryx's Beta AR ($600) is the perfect case in point. It is the driest thing I have right now. If you live in a climate where it's so wet that you have to swap out your morning rain jacket for your afternoon rain jacket to let them dry, it's worth every penny. It uses Gore-Tex three-layer construction and has a stand-up collar with microsuede to keep your chin from getting chafed. It's incredibly roomy (I can fit a giant sweatshirt underneath it) and light and packable.\n\nThere are a ton of other great options in this category. I have an AscentShell by Outdoor Research (men’s sizing, women’s sizing) that has held up for several years, and I still use it. The Helium line is a classic. Other favorites include the Patagonia Torrentshell (men’s sizing, women’s sizing), which both my spouse and I have owned for over a decade. In an attempt to find a more sustainable option in this category, I recently tried the Rab Downpour Plus (men's sizing, women's sizing). Its specs are very good on paper, and I have other Rab jackets that I love, so my hopes were high. However, I, like many reviewers, found that the fluorocarbon-free DWR just wasn't as effective as Arc'teryx's.\n\nBest Affordable Rain Jacket\n\nFor $100, it is tough to find a rain jacket that offers better value than the Rainier. It uses high-quality laminate waterproofing instead of the less expensive coating that many cheaper rain jackets rely on. (Read more below on laminates and layers.) Rather than bonding a waterproof, breathable membrane below the shell fabric, manufacturers will save money by just coating the inner surface with a waterproof, breathable film. It’s less pricey but also less durable than three-layer construction.\n\nThe Rainier has many great features that are tough to find in rain jackets at this price. For example, it’s made from recycled nylon and has venting pit zips. It’s also seam-taped, has a weatherproof center zip, and features an adjustable, packable hood. For casual day hikes and traveling, the Rainier jacket is a great choice.\n\n? Good alternatives: In the past several years, there has been an explosion in affordable rain jackets. If you’re not doing anything more strenuous than mowing your lawn or walking the dog, these are fine! WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson’s own rain jacket is the Red Ledge Thunderlight ($20). I tried the Decathlon Quechua MH100 ($60) and the Decathlon Quechua NH100 ($17). They work! But they run very small and are not very breathable, and the fabric is stiff and not particularly pleasant to wear. I would keep the NH100 as an emergency layer in my hiking backpack. I also tried the Frogg Togg's ultralight jacket ($19). It's possible that my pink one was a fluke, but I hated the color and slimy texture of the fabric. At least it came with a stuff sack?\n\nBest Rain Pants\n\nEveryone wants dry legs, but no one, aside from toddlers, wants to wear rain-specific pants. Either you wear a giant plastic bag over your jeans and feel awkward and uncomfortable, or you wear leggings and have to change when you get to work. If you want insulated, waterproof pants that don't look too conspicuous when you bike to the movie theater, you probably want a pair of Duers.\n\nI've had a pair of these for several years and wear them whenever the weather gets gnarly. The weatherproof membrane is definitely noticeable and does have a slightly rubbery feel in the interior, but I find it to be soft and comfortable enough overall to wear through the entire day. They also have it in a men's version, as well as in a more fashionable barrel-leg fit.\n\n? Good alternatives: However, there are days when nothing but a real rain pant will do. I own the Helly Hansen Seven rain pant ($75) (men's version) and have also been pleased with the REI Co-Op rain pants ($60) (women's version). As the weather has gotten colder, I have also discovered that DWR-treated cross-country ski pants ($169) are also comfortable and great for rain.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n    I really like REI’s in-house jackets: I am continually surprised by the value for the price in REI’s line. Its casual rain jackets have plenty of nice features, work well, and cost hundreds of dollars less than many of my other picks; I buy their jackets on sale every year for my kids.\n    These jackets have interesting design details: Running jackets often have breathable slits and zips all over them to let your swampy armpits air out when you’re sweating. The Janji Rainrunner ($198) is basically a waterproof tank top layered underneath a long-sleeved crop top. I also tried Coalatree’s Whistler ($99), which is a lightweight windbreaker with a DWR application. Its HiloTech fabric is also self-repairing—if you get tiny holes in the fabric from a thorny plant or a sparking ember off a fire, you can rub it with your fingertips to patch it up.\n\nUnderstanding Rain Jacket Tech\n\nTrying to decipher jackets’ product specs is almost as annoying as getting soaked by a sudden cloudburst on the trail.\n\nLook for laminated layers: Most technical waterproof jackets are referred to as two- or three-layer jackets. These layers usually consist of a face fabric that has been treated with a waterproofing agent like durable water repellent, which is a thin mesh for releasing water vapor, plus a protective interior lining underneath. In general, for greater durability you’ll want to look for layers that have been laminated together, rather than merely coated with a waterproofing agent. That’s the advice of Amber Williams, the consumer science educator and lecturer from Utah State University.\n\nWaterproof and breathability ratings: Manufacturers usually rate each fabric based on its waterproofing and breathability. For example, a rain jacket with a waterproof rating of 20,000 means that if you had an endlessly long 1-inch square tube, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water on top of the fabric before it would start seeping through (that's over 65 feet!). A 20,000 breathability rating means that 20,000 grams of water vapor can pass through the fabric going the other direction. While the higher breathability rating might seem better, you might want to think twice if you’ll be out in the cold. Body heat can escape a breathable jacket almost as easily as water vapor.\n\nFantastic fabrics: Gore-Tex remains the gold standard in terms of waterproofing performance. But every company is experimenting with new weaving techniques, PFC-free waterproofing technologies in particular. The North Face’s Futurelight is a spider-weight, waterproof, yet breathable fabric that allows designers to create garments with far fewer seams.\n\nCheck the seams and zippers: If you want your rain jacket to last longer than an amusement park poncho, look at the seams. Shoulders are particularly vulnerable points, as most outdoor sports require you to wear a backpack that can rub and damage them. “Design lines look really sexy, but over time, they’re not going to last as long,” Williams says. Other features to look for include plasticized, water-resistant zippers and protective zipper flaps. That’s why our rain jacket picks are so expensive—a lot of new fabric tech and a lot of design details!\n\nCare for your jacket: You can vastly extend the life of your items by properly caring for them. Hang your jacket—don’t store it crammed in an abrasive, tiny stuff sack. If you see stains from grease, dirt, or sunscreen, or notice that water is no longer beading on the surface, you’ll need to wash it. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. You may need a specialized detergent—many fabric detergents will leave residues that can interfere with DWR’s performance. Avoid fabric softener, bleaches, dry cleaning, and the dryer.",

        "articleBody": "From the astrology software of the 1970s to the Co-Star app, spirituality has proliferated online. Now, large language models can find overlooked ways to connect with a higher plane.\n\nTen years ago, I used my first post-college paycheck to meet an astrologer. Guided by a rickety stairway, I entered her Alphabet City apartment-turned-sanctum and was greeted by an eccentric Aquarius donning avant-garde garb (she had moved to New York in the 1980s and appeared to still be living in that era). A bathtub in the living room set the scene for a mystical encounter. However, the enchantment quickly dissipated as the reading commenced and I was handed a 33-page printout, which the astrologer read aloud.\n\nI had grown up in a household where astrology was a fervent topic of discussion, and I knew most of my planetary placements by heart. I’d gone there hoping for something more transformative, something I couldn’t generate online.\n\nFast-forward a decade, and we’re in a spiritual revolution. Access to astrology and other spiritual practices has proliferated across witchy corners of the internet, with many tools fully embracing artificial intelligence as part of the supernatural process. When I tell my story to Banu Guler, CEO of the astrology app Co-Star, she reminds me that I was not accessing spirituality when I visited the astrologer’s apartment. “You might have a spiritual experience as a result of the reading, but they’re not giving you spirituality—that’s not what the exchange is,” she said. The exchange, in fact, is new information, a framework for evaluating emotions in the present moment. Reading about your placements is a different process from practicing spirituality.\n\nThe first digital era of astrology lasted from the 1970s to the 2000s, with the development of astrological chart-drawing software and the advent of personal websites like Susan Miller’s Astrology Zone and astrology companies like Astrodienst (astro.com). The decade that began in 2010 ushered in the arrival of astrology memes on Tumblr and Instagram, a cultural uptick in interests like crystals, and the proliferation of astrology startups. Today’s spiritual landscape was formed in the aftermath of the global pandemic and access to large language models, a confusing, transitional era in which new tools are upending every industry. In this period, AI has emerged as a powerful tool that can find new links between the ethereal and the tangible, directing our attention to relationships we might have overlooked and promising to connect us to a higher plane.\n\nThe reading I received 10 years ago was generated using Matrix Software, founded in 1977 by programmer and astrologer Michael Erlewine. While both Matrix Software and Co-Star, which was founded in 2017, provide users with customized chart analyses based on a delicate intersection of planets at the time, date, and location of their birth, Co-Star’s readings are more comprehensive and dynamically updated, with horoscopes, readings, and interactive question-and-answer services written in a poetic tone that resonates with a trendy, contemporary audience. The name Matrix Software echoes the detachment that existed between humans and computers in the previous digital age. In this age of AI, however, language has become an increasingly important way to feign connections with human users.\n\nEarly on, Co-Star achieved its literary style by having writers train “AI Pets,” large language models developed in-house and trained on their own text messages, always combining a personal voice with the automated delivery. The success of these apps draws on the “Eliza effect,” whereby people humanize computed behavior and form an emotional connection. The effect is named after the first chatbot, Eliza, which was created in 1966 to respond like a therapist to human inputs. Though it’s easy to see why this example is resurfacing today as a cautionary tale, talking to yourself through the lens of an external “guru” can help you pinpoint your own belief system.\n\nFeatured Video\n\n \nMost Popular\n\n    The World’s Most Important Industry Has a New Captain&-and She’s Piloting It Into the 21st Century\n    Backchannel\n    The World’s Most Important Industry Has a New Captain—and She’s Piloting It Into the 21st Century\n\n    Virginia Heffernan\n    Is There Lead in Your Reusable Water Bottle?\n    Gear\n    Is There Lead in Your Reusable Water Bottle?\n\n    Medea Giordano\n    The 45 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now\n    Culture\n    The 45 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now\n\n    Jennifer M.

Perhaps this tool can help tech-savvy Christians level up their practice or provide new interpretations of the text by juxtaposing different pieces with each other.\n\nLarge language models bring the feedback of an imagined priest, rabbi, or swami to your screen, promising to deliver a “spiritual” experience in the comfort of your own home. As AI researcher Shira Eisenberg points out, future models can be trained on any text, religious or otherwise. The question becomes, which model will you choose to interact with? Someday, each person’s base model will be trained on their own sets of values, she postulates, adding that this will result in conflicts in information and advice between different people’s devices. That is not dissimilar to theological conversations that take place off the screen, however. All of it depends on whether you believe in a higher power, but if you do, it can become a way of connecting with your faith.\n\nI’ve used ChatGPT to guess some of my astrological placements based on my published work. Initially it wouldn’t even try (guessing zodiac signs is a speculative endeavor, and as a large-language model, it could not accurately predict results). However, I continued to press the program and let it know that I’d take everything it says with a grain of salt, after which it pinpointed my rising and Venus signs with surprising accuracy, though it misinterpreted my sun sign. The sign it was most reluctant to reveal was my moon sign, which is often considered the indicator of an individual’s “true” self, but it finally ventured a guess and accurately identified my Scorpio moon, which is known for a passionate quality reflected in the emotionally resonant themes in my creative work.\n\n“It’s all nonsense, of course,” says philosopher Paul Thagard, author of the widely cited 1978 paper, “Why Astrology is a Pseudoscience,” after checking his own horoscope from ChatGPT. “Astrology has no causality,” he adds, “It’s completely incompatible with what we know from physics and biology.”\n\nHilary Thurston disagrees. Known on TikTok as “the Tarotologist,” she approaches readings from a critical perspective, looking at what resonates with the individual rather than evaluating a message from an external deity. A PhD candidate in critical mental health and addiction studies, a social service counselor with 10 years of experience, and a self-taught tarot card reader, she writes that astrology is a system for measuring and predicting patterns in the natural world that has centuries of data to back it up. The abundance of astrological content floating around online makes it an inviting target for LLMs to analyze and gives them an opportunity to connect patterns that are not widely understood. ChatGPT’s ability to correctly guess some of my zodiac placements “speaks more to the effectiveness of AI to collate and present information that already exists on the subject,” she says.\n\nHowever, choosing whether to believe that astrology has validity is, in some ways, missing the point. Even without 100 percent certainty, the desire to find a framework that guides us through this turning point in technology is unifying.\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to find its way into our spiritual practices, it will contribute to a broader vocabulary of psychological theories through individuals who spend time asking introspective questions and receiving feedback, similar to the style of talk therapy that allows a participant to reveal what they actually think to themselves. It will provide new, personalized ways of using technology and make us stronger communicators. Whether you seek out these practices or not, the enticing interface screens beg for a back-and-forth exchange. Regardless of which belief you subscribe to, the practice of slowing down and asking questions allows us to deepen our relationship to ourselves and prepare for the certain uncertainties ahead.",

        "title": "'The Income Tax Is Just Killing Me,' — Wealthy People Are Ditching These States And Moving To Places Where Their Money Goes Further",

        "articleBody": "The concept of wealth in America is undergoing significant transformation, highlighted by the increasing movement of high-income earners in search of financial prosperity and a better quality of life.\n\nThis shift, exemplified by moves like Jeff Bezos’s relocation from Washington to Florida, illuminates a broader pursuit of favorable tax policies, lifestyle preferences and burgeoning business opportunities. Bezos’s strategic decision to move, potentially saving up to $600 million in taxes, encapsulates a growing sentiment among America’s affluent: The quest for fiscal efficiency and quality of life is reshaping the country’s demographic map?.\n\nIn recent years, IRS data revealed an exodus of wealth from major urban centers. Large coastal cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles saw over $68 billion in taxable income depart because of net migration between 2020 and 2021. This migration wasn’t random; high earners were drawn to states like Florida, Texas and Arizona, attracted by the promise of no personal income tax, thriving business environments and a quality of life unattainable in their previous locales??.\n\nIn California, personal income taxes are as high as 12.3%. Todd Litman, an estate planning attorney in Tustin, reflects a growing concern among high-income earners in California. Litman’s observation that an increasing number of his clients, particularly those with significant retirement savings, are considering leaving California because of the state’s high income tax rates illustrates a broader trend of tax-driven migration. \"They're saying, ‘Hey, I'm working hard and the income tax is just killing me,'\" he told the Napa Valley Register.\n\nFlorida emerged as the leading beneficiary of this net income migration, with Texas and Arizona close behind. These states offer a financial haven with their lack of income tax and boast attributes that resonate with those seeking a balance between work and leisure. The allure of these states is so strong that even cities like Tucson, Arizona; Charleston, South Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; and Raleigh, North Carolina, became magnets for those fleeing the high cost of living and restrictive tax regimes of their former homes??.\n\nWhat drives this significant shift in residency among the affluent? Beyond the financial benefits, the migration trend reveals a deeper narrative about Americans reevaluating what constitutes a desirable life. The states seeing the highest inflows offer more than tax relief; they promise a lifestyle that aligns with modern priorities: space, accessibility to nature and a sense of community lost in the hustle of major urban centers.\n\nThis narrative is further supported by the states people are leaving. New Jersey, Illinois and New York lead the list, with residents citing high taxes, cost of living and in some cases, weather and climate change concerns as primary motivators for their departure. These moves are not merely financial decisions but profound statements on seeking a better quality of life??.\n\nAs America’s wealthy navigate these changes, their moves underscore a critical redefinition of wealth. It’s no longer just about income but the quality of life that income can secure. With states like Florida and Texas leading the charge in attracting the affluent, the American dream is being reimagined, reshaping the nation’s economic landscape in profound and far-reaching ways????.",

        "articleBody": "Wall Street is ready for the next big media merger.\n\nAs companies in the space face challenges such as cord cutting, a tough ad environment, and more pressure to turn profits, many are reevaluating their portfolios. That means a breakup— or outright sale — of one or more of America's biggest media names could be in the cards next year, analysts say.\n\n\"We believe the media industry is inching closer to the tipping point for another wave of consolidation,\" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a recent note.\n\nShe explained the secular declines of linear television subscribers coupled with challenges in achieving profits in the streaming business add to the narrative that \"consolidation is a matter of 'when' not 'if.'\"\n\nThat \"when\" may be sooner rather than later, with Axios reporting late last month that Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav and Paramount Global (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish met in New York City to discuss a possible merger.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on the report, although Paramount appears to have become the industry's No. 1 pick for structural changes ahead.\n\nParamount deal could set off frenzy\n\nLast month, multiple outlets reported that Shari Redstone was considering selling her family's controlling stake in Paramount. Redstone is president of her family's holding company, National Amusements (NAI), which controls the company through its Class A shares. Private investment firm RedBird Capital has been reported as a potential buyer, along with Skydance Media CEO David Ellison.\n\nParamount has long been viewed as a potential acquisition target due to its small size relative to competitors. The company boasts a current market cap of just around $10 billion, compared to Disney's (DIS) $170 billion and Netflix's (NFLX) roughly $210 billion.\n\nAnalysts have said a Paramount deal could set off an M&A frenzy.\n\nIn addition to Paramount, Bank of America's Reif Ehrlich said Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal (CMCSA) are also \"likely to be impacted [by consolidation] over the next 18 to 24 months.\" As the Axios report suggested, it's possible two of those three players could merge.\n\nIndividual assets are also reportedly in play. Bloomberg reported Paramount is once again in talks to sell BET Media Group — this time to its CEO Scott Mills and former Blackstone executive Chinh Chu, who now runs private investment firm CC Capital Partners. A price of just under $2 billion is under discussion, according to the report.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger said last summer the company would take an \"expansive\" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling they could potentially be sold.\n\nThe company's TV portfolio includes broadcast network ABC and cable channels FX, Freeform, and National Geographic.\n\nHe eventually reversed course, clarifying at last month's DealBook summit that linear TV assets \"are not for sale.\" Still, the company is \"constantly evaluating\" their fit within the overall business, he said.\n\nSeparately, Altice USA (ATUS) sold its news arm Cheddar News to media company Archetype, which is owned by private equity firm Regent. Altice had acquired Cheddar for $200 million in 2019. Terms of the Archetype deal were not disclosed.\n\n\"Handicapping the precise timing of any transformational deal is difficult,\" Reif Ehrlich said. \"However, we believe the challenging backdrop creates ripe conditions for consolidation.\"\n\nMedia challenges likely to spur deal activity\n\n2023 represented a year of change for the industry after rising costs and debt-ridden balance sheets weighed on the sector in 2022 — and wiped off more than $500 billion in market capitalization.\n\nIn response, media giants enacted mass layoffs and slashed billions of dollars' worth of costs. They rolled out ad-supported tiers, bundled their offerings, and raised the monthly prices of their respective subscription plans.\n\nBut all of that wasn't enough to satisfy investors. Valuation levels remain depressed. And streaming profitability still has a long way to go, with virtually all media companies (with the exception of Netflix) losing money on that business.\n\nBart Spiegel, partner of global entertainment & media deals at PwC, said those challenges are exactly why companies will begin to explore possible deals.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of companies focus on divestitures,\" he told Yahoo Finance, explaining that the high interest rate environment, coupled with various regulatory hurdles, are forcing more companies to assess their existing portfolios — and position non-core assets for sale.\n\n\"A lot of these companies are engaging us because they see opportunities in 2024,\" he said, noting private equity funds are sitting on more than $1 trillion in dry powder, or cash reserves. \"We're seeing a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines, people are preparing their businesses for sale, and, in some areas, there's a lot of interest in activity.\"\n\nPwC said demand for live sports, including sports-adjacent industries like sports gambling, will likely drive future M&A activity. Gaming, which companies like Netflix have recently doubled down on, should serve as another catalyst.\n\nDeal volumes and values in the media and telecommunications sector continued to slow in 2023 — falling even further from last year's declines, according to PwC's biannual US deals outlook.\n\nOver the past 12 months ending in November, there have been 2,028 media and telecom deals — a 22% year-over-year decrease — with announced deal value totaling $95 billion, a 63% dip versus 2022.\n\nSpiegel warned a comeback could be slow. Interest rates remain high while regulatory approval hurdles will likely weigh on potential deals. Uncertainty surrounding the 2024 election cycle could also be a headwind.\n\nStill, he predicted the second half of 2024 should be a \"welcome opportunity for the deals market to turn around\" — especially after the conclusion of both the writers and actors strikes earlier this fall.\n\n\"Now you've got some level of transparency and predictability,\" Spiegel said of the strikes.",

        "title": "I'm a fan of Marshall speakers, but I didn't expect its earbuds to be this good",
        "authors": "Jack Wallen",
        "date": "2023-12-24",
        "articleBody": "Marshall is a name known by many in the music scene, recognizable by its sound. I tested its latest Motif ANC earbuds to see if they live up to the hype.\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\n    The Marshall Motif A.N.C. earbuds are on sale now for $120 at the Marshall online store.\n    With the help of the Marshall Bluetooth companion app, you'll hear a remarkable sound that beautifully serves just about every genre of music.\n    Without the personalization settings in the app, the Motif earbuds deliver a sound that's too heavy in the mids.\n\nI own a Marshall amp, and although I'm a terrible guitar player, I love the way it sounds. There's just no mistaking the Marshall signature sound, as it's gritty and in your face. It's rock-and-roll, plain and simple. So, when I received a pair of Marshall earbuds to review, you can only imagine how excited I was to test them out.\n\nSadly, out of the box, that amazing Marshall sound didn't exactly translate well to earbuds. Instead of that powerhouse rock and roll glory, I was treated to heavy mids and lackluster lows. To get the most out of these earbuds, you'll need to install the Marshall Bluetooth app (for Android or iOS). Once I downloaded the app and customized the EQ settings, I experienced some of the best noise control I've ever heard.\n\nCome with me as I show you how I turned the Marshall Motif II A.N.C earbuds into a pair of earbuds suitable for audiophiles like me.\n\nThe specs\n\nTo start, let me lay out the specs for the Marshall Motif A.N.C. earbuds, which are:\n\n    Driver sensitivity - 106 +/- 1 mW (0.126Vrms) 1 kHz.\n    Driver type - dynamic\n    Driver impedance - 16 O\n    Frequency range - 20-20,000 Hz\n    Drivers - 6 mm\n    Battery - 4.5 hours with A.N.C. enabled (6 hours with it disabled), 20 total hours in case.\n    Wireless charging - yes\n    Water resistance - IPX5 in earbuds IPX4 in case\n    Bluetooth range - 30 ft.\n    Controls - touch response for music control A.N.C. activation, receive/end calls, activate transparency mode\n    Cost - $119.99 (down from $199.99)\n\nThe Motif earbuds include a Marshall amp-inspired case, USB-C charging cable, user manual, and S, M, and L ear tips.\nMy experience\n\nThe Motif earbuds come with three Noise Control modes: ANC, TRA (transparency mode), and off, a setting with neither TRA nor ANC enabled. With Noise Control off, the Motif A.N.C. earbuds sound a bit hollow. But once you enable either ANC or TRA, these babies go up to that fabled 11. \n\nYou can also adjust the ANC level, which makes the Motif earbuds even more customizable. Once I had these earbuds set to my liking, I found that rock music rocked a bit harder, metal was a bit more head-banging, classical was more dynamic, and every other genre was way more enjoyable. \n\nAs I said, I love the Marshall sound in a guitar amp. For earbuds, it was a bit harsh on the ears. That was easily overcome with a bit of custom EQ. With a bit of bass bump, treble increase, and midrange drop, the Motif earbuds came to life. I ran them through my usual tests, with rock, prog, metal, classical, Broadway, and choral music. \n\nI was actually surprised at how good choral music was lifted from the earbuds to sound as if the singers were standing around me. Songs like Pink Martini's In Stiller Nacht were gorgeous, with each voice clear and rich. My favorite Christmas song, Lully, Lulla, Lullay, by VOCES8, was resonant and full.\n\nEven the \"Godzilla Minus One\" original score took me right back to the theatre, where I was watching one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Naoki Sato's music was simultaneously chilling and beautiful.\n\nSwitching over to a bit of prog, I opted to go with Rush's Analog Kid and couldn't help but dance about my office at hearing Geddy Lee's bass sound exactly as he intended it. This song, in particular, was killer with the Motif earbuds.\n\nEvery song I threw at the Marshall earbuds made it clear these buds are worth every penny. Are they the greatest earbuds I've ever used? No. That title still belongs to the Denon PerL Pro earbuds. But the Marshall Motif are currently half the price of the Denons. So, if you want amazing sound but can't afford a nearly $400 pair of earbuds, the Marshall Motif will not disappoint. \nZDNET buying advice\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is this: If you prefer the sound of overly produced and heavy-handed bass (such as what you'll hear from Beats headphones), these are not for you. The Marshall Motif earbuds strive to reproduce the music as closely as the artist intended, and in turn, deliver a rich and smooth blend of voices and frequencies. \n\nYes, you can punch up one of the five EQ bands, but the Motif earbuds aren't going to sound like they have a tiny, attached subwoofer. Like the Denon PerL Pro, the Marshall Motif earbuds' sound is more refined than your average buds.\n\nThat doesn't mean they can't rock, because they certainly can.",

        "articleBody": "Google's Duet AI tool also becomes generally available and will get Gemini access 'over the next few weeks.' \n\nGoogle on Wednesday morning announced its top-of-the-line artificial intelligence program, Gemini, unveiled last week, will be available as a preview version of the \"Pro\" version of Gemini immediately to users of its AI Studio programming tool, and its fully managed programming tool for enterprises, Vertex AI, running in Google Cloud.\n\nThe company is also making Gemini available \"over the next few weeks\" in Duet AI, its coding tool enhanced with generative AI, which it announced became generally available Wednesday.\n\n\"Gemini is trained and part of a broad AI hyper-computing infrastructure,\" said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian in a press briefing, referring to the company's custom AI chip, the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. \"This is the infrastructure we're offering not just internally but now to customers.\"\n\nPart of Wednesday's announcement was the general availability of TPU v5p, which increases the performance of TPUs by four times over the existing v4 chips. \n\nThe AI studio is meant for individuals and small teams. The preview of Gemini Pro can be used in AI Studio with a free quota of 60 requests per minute, which Google emphasized is 20 times as many as other free programming tools.\n\nA demo was shown of building a real estate broker application in AI Studio using mostly natural-language prompting, with the ability to insert pictures of a house's interior and have the program generate text descriptions of the features of the photos. \n\nVertex AI, in contrast to AI Studio, has hooks into numerous corporate data sources, including from third-party Google Cloud partners, so its emphasis is on the use of an enterprise's own data.\n\nKurian emphasized work being done to reassure enterprises that Gemini will avoid the highly-publicized \"hallucinations\" that have created concern about their use. \n\nZDNET asked Google Cloud, \"In your early work with enterprises, how long does it take to get sufficient output from Gemini Pro to satisfy a company's concerns that the output is likely to be accurate, consistent, and safe?\"\n\nGoogle Cloud declined to \"speculate on this forward-looking question\" given that access to Gemini Pro \"at scale\" is only beginning with the AI Studio and Vertex AI availability now.\n\nThe announcements come as Google Cloud this week is hosting a free Applied AI summit for developers.  \n\nYou can sign up for Vertex AI as a free trial when you sign up to Google Cloud as a free trial. Using Gemini Pro in preview mode in Vertex AI has the same free allotment of 60 requests per minute. \n\nGoogle Cloud said that both AI Studio and Vertex AI will transition to formal pricing of a fraction of a cent per 1,000 characters when Google Pro becomes generally available \"early next year.\" \n\nThe company reduced its Google Cloud pricing by four times for input and two times on output, said Kurian.\ngoogle-gemini-pricing-dec-2023\n\nThe Pro version of Gemini is one of three versions, the other two being Ultra and Nano. Ultra is currently in private preview with select customers to get feedback, noted Kurian, while Nano is going to be released on mobile devices. It is already running on Google's Pixel 8 smartphone.\n\nGoogle Cloud also announced a new version of its text-to-image neural network, Imagen 2, which it says has greater capabilities for things such as text rendering, for inserting corporate brands into images (your company logo on a toothpaste tube in a picture of a bathroom.)\n\nImagen2 is available in the Vertex AI feature called Model Garden which includes a collection of different neural network programs. \n\nThe Model Garden includes multiple third-party neural networks for the first time, including Mistral, ImageBind, and DITO.",
